                <p>The publication <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi>
                    constitutes the official record of the foreign policy of the United States. The
                    volumes in the series include, subject to necessary security considerations, all
                    documents needed to give a comprehensive record of the major foreign policy
                    decisions of the United States together with appropriate materials concerning
                    the facts that contributed to the formulation of policies. Documents in the
                    files of the Department of State are supplemented by papers from other
                    government agencies involved in the formulation of foreign policy.</p>
                <p>The basic documentary diplomatic record printed in the volumes of the series is
                    edited by the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, Department of
                    State. The editing is guided by the principles of historical objectivity and in
                    accordance with the following official guidance first promulgated by Secretary
                    of State Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925:</p>
                <p>There may be no alteration of the text, no deletions without indicating the place
                    in the text where the deletion is made, and no omission of facts which were of
                    major importance in reaching a decision. Nothing may be omitted for the purpose
                    of concealing or glossing over what might be regarded by some as a defect of
                    policy. However, certain omissions of documents are permissible for the
                    following reasons:</p>
                <p>a. To avoid publication of matters that would tend to impede current diplomatic
                    negotiations or other business.</p>
                <p>b. To condense the record and avoid repetition of needless details.</p>
                <p>c. To preserve the confidence reposed in the Department by individuals and by
                    foreign governments.</p>
                <p>d. To avoid giving needless offense to other nationalities or individuals.</p>
                <p>e. To eliminate personal opinions presented in dispatches and not acted upon by
                    the Department. To this consideration there is one qualification: in connection
                    with major decisions it is desirable, where possible, to show the alternative
                    presented to the Department before the decision was made.</p>

                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Principles of Selection for Foreign Relations, 1961-1963,
                    Volume II</p>
                <p>Document selection for this volume proceeded on the basis of a research plan
                    developed by the editors after a preliminary review of repositories in both
                    governmental and private agencies. From the outset the editors also approached
                    their research with the recognition of the need to supplement the written record
                    of U.S. policy during the Vietnam war with interviews of officials who
                    participated in the policy process. Early attention was also given to those oral
                    history interviews of participants already in existence and available in various
                    locations.</p>
                <p>On the basis of their preliminary research and the review of already-published
                    documentation, including the <hi rend="italic">Pentagon Papers of 1971</hi>, the
                    editors developed the following five major general areas of focus for the
                    research and selection of documents for inclusion in this volume: 1) Discussion
                    and formulation of policy in Washington; 2) Policy implementation; 3) Reports
                    from the Embassy in Saigon; 4) U.S. military involvement in Vietnam; and 5)
                    Intelligence activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">Discussion and formulation of policy in Washington</hi>:
                    President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">John F. Kennedy</persName> made the basic
                    policy decisions on Vietnam, based on advice from the Washington foreign affairs
                    community, either at meetings or in documents submitted to him. The records of
                    these meetings with the President and advice provided to him in writing are at
                    the center of this volume. The editors are confident that they have had complete
                    access to all the Presidential records bearing on Vietnam policy. The primary
                    source for these records is the John F. Kennedy Library. The records of the
                    Department of State, to which the editors had the fullest access, include a
                    large segment of Presidential and National Security Council documentation, but
                    the Kennedy Library document holdings remain the single most comprehensive
                    source. The papers of the President's Military Representative, General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Maxwell D. Taylor</persName>, at the National Defense
                    University in Washington, D.C. are also of unusual importance. Largely
                    unduplicated at any other repository, the <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> Papers provide a unique record of <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>'s advice to the President on Vietnam
                    and records of some meetings both at the White House and at the Department of
                    Defense for which there are no other accounts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">Policy implementation</hi>: The editors also selected
                    documentation that covered the implementation of Presidentially established
                    policy and involved a range of lesser policy decisions that did not reach the
                    White House or were resolved at the Department of State or other agencies in the
                    foreign affairs community. The files of the Department of State and the Kennedy
                    Library are the primary documentary sources for these matters.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb n="V" xml:id="pg_V" facs="0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italic">Reports from the Embassy in Saigon</hi>: The editors selected
                    a representative portion of telegrams from the Embassy in Saigon that reported
                    on important meetings with Vietnamese leaders and furnished policy-makers in
                    Washington with information on the impact of U.S. policy decisions and programs.
                    The editors also included in this volume some of the more important telegraphic
                    reports from the Embassy in Saigon on the Vietnamese attitude toward the United
                    States and U.S. officials as well as on internal developments in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">U.S. military involvement in Vietnam</hi>: The editors did not
                    attempt to include in this volume any documentation on the U.S. military
                    involvement in the war in Vietnam. They did, however, seek to include that
                    portion of the official documentation that illustrated the main relationships
                    between military planning and strategy and the conduct of U.S. diplomatic
                    relations with Vietnam and other countries. The <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> Papers are at the center of the editors' selection of
                    this documentation as are the files of the Secretary of Defense and the
                    Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs at the
                    Washington National Records Center of the National Archives and Records
                    Administration. The Department of State was not a principal party in the
                    military planning for Vietnam, and its files include no significant record of
                    this part of U.S. involvement in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">Intelligence activities</hi>: The editors sought to include in
                    this volume a representative selection of major intelligence appraisals and
                    estimates on the basis of which foreign policies were formulated. They did not
                    make any effort to research any alleged covert operations conducted in Vietnam.
                    Most of the intelligence documentation included in this volume was obtained from
                    the files of the Department of State and the Kennedy Library. These documents
                    and those furnished by the Central Intelligence Agency provided a wide range of
                    intelligence-related information on Vietnam. The editors believe that they have
                    satisfactorily documented the more significant aspects of the role of
                    intelligence in the formulation and implementation of U.S. policy toward
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>In preparing this volume the editors emphasized the political and economic
                    aspects of the formulation of U.S. foreign policy. They did not seek to document
                    the full range of U.S. relations with Vietnam in the military, cultural, or
                    informational spheres. The editors did take careful account of the documentation
                    in the complete Pentagon Papers, both the published and unpublished volumes of
                    documents on diplomatic relations. The editors have, in general, sought to avoid
                    reprinting here documents already published in the Pentagon Papers.</p>
                <p>The declassification review process for the documents prepared for this volume,
                    outlined in more detail below, resulted in withholding from publication only an
                    insignificant percentage of the original manuscript. <pb n="VI" xml:id="pg_VI" facs="0006"/>No documents of major significance to the understanding of the
                    policy discussions and decisions presented in the volume were withheld for
                    security reasons. The editors of the volume are confident that the documents
                    printed here provide a comprehensive and accurate foreign affairs record of
                    United States involvement in the Vietnam war in 1962.</p>
                <p>The editors wish to acknowledge the assistance of officials at the National
                    Archives and Records Administration; the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library,
                    in particular Suzanne Forbes; the Department of Defense; and other specialized
                    document repositories who assisted in collection of documents for this
                    volume.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time.
                    Incoming telegrams from U.S. missions are placed according to the time of
                    receipt in the Department of State, rather than the time of transmission;
                    memoranda of conversations are placed according to the time and date of the
                    conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the Foreign Relations series
                    follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by guidance from the Editor in
                    Chief and the chief technical editor. The source text is reproduced as exactly
                    as possible, including marginalia or other notations, which are described in
                    footnotes. Obvious typographical errors are corrected, but other mistakes and
                    omissions in the source text are corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction
                    is set in italic type; an omission in roman type. Brackets are also used to
                    indicate text that has been omitted by the compiler because it deals with an
                    unrelated subject. Ellipses are inserted to replace material that remained
                    classified after the declassification review process. Ellipses of three or four
                    periods identify excisions of less than a paragraph; ellipses of seven periods
                    spread across the page identify excisions of an entire paragraph or more. All
                    ellipses and brackets that appear in the source text are so identified by
                    footnotes.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the document's source, original
                    classification, distribution, and drafting information. The source footnote also
                    provides the background of important documents and policies and indicates if the
                    President or Secretary of State read the document. Every effort has been made to
                    determine if a document has been previously published and this information has
                    been included in the source footnote.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in this volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide <pb n="VII" xml:id="pg_VII" facs="0007"/>summaries of and citations to public statements that supplement and elucidate
                    the printed documents. Information derived from memoirs of participants and
                    other first-hand accounts, available when this volume was originally compiled in
                    1983, has been used where possible to supplement the official record.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Declassification Review Procedures</p>
                <p>Declassification review of the documents selected for publication was conducted
                    by the Division of Historical Documents Review, Bureau of Diplomatic Security,
                    Department of State. The review was made in accordance with the Freedom of
                    Information Act, the Privacy Act, and the criteria established in Executive
                    Order 12356 regarding:</p>
                <p>1) military plans, weapons, or operations;</p>
                <p>2) the vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations, projects, or
                    plans relating to the national security;</p>
                <p>3) foreign government information;</p>
                <p>4) intelligence activities (including special activities), or intelligence
                    sources or methods;</p>
                <p>5) foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States;</p>

                    security</p>
                <p>7) U.S. Government programs for safeguarding nuclear materials or facilities;</p>
                <p>8) cryptology; and</p>
                <p>9) a confidential source.</p>
                <p>Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the appropriate geographic and

                    the U.S. Government, and communication with foreign governments regarding
                    documents of those governments. The principle of declassification review is to
                    release as much information as is consistent with contemporary requirements of
                    national security and sound foreign relations; some documents originally
                    selected and portions of documents presented have been withheld.</p>

                            operations in Vietnam.<note n="3" xml:id="d1fn3">See <ref target="frus1961-63v01#d275">

                                    Document 275</ref>.</note> These operations were to start with
                            the clearance of key routes and proceed thereafter to food denial only
                            after the most careful basis of resettlement and alternative food supply
                            has been created. Proposed operations in Zone D and the border areas
                            were not to be undertaken until there were realistic possibilities of
                            immediate military exploitation.</p>
                        <p>A specific plan for clearance of key routes has been developed by <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>. As the proposed initial
                            defoliant operation, it has been designed with limited specific
                            objectives to provide an opportunity to evaluate its success and thereby
                            determine the advisability of further defoliant operations. The
                            operations recommended in the plan are designed to clear vegetation
                            along key lines of communication to be used by the Vietnamese in a
                            campaign to eliminate the Viet Cong from specified provinces in Southern
                            Vietnam. Principal features of the plan are the following:</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="pg_2" facs="0022"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Objectives.</p>
                        <p>a. To assist the counter-insurgency operation by clearing lines of
                            communication in support of current or projected campaigns.</p>
                        <p>b. To improve aerial observation of selected areas controlled by the Viet
                            Cong.</p>
                        <p>c. To assist in clearing fields of fire and to reduce the likelihood of
                            close-in ambushes.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">2. Scope</hi>. Approximately three hundred miles of
                            road would be defoliated to a distance of 200 meters on both sides. The
                            selected routes are all at least ten miles from the Cambodian Border.
                            (See attached map.)<note n="4" xml:id="d1fn4">Not printed.</note> They
                            would be defoliated by segment in a sequence which avoids concentrating
                            the operation in any one area, thereby reducing the risk of alerting the
                            Viet Cong to the proposed Vietnamese campaign in Binh Duong Province.
                            Operations would commence about 10 January. It could take up to two
                            weeks to determine the full effect of the first application, and a
                            second application may be required for all or part of the area.
                            Sufficient chemicals for the operation arrive in Saigon this week.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">3. Participation</hi>. Defoliant operations will be
                            conducted by U.S. and VN forces. The bulk of the operation will be
                            carried out by U.S. personnel in uniform under PACAF control. They will
                            employ U.S. C-123 aircraft with <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>
                            markings. Some of the spraying will be performed by Vietnamese employing
                            their own H-34 helicopters and ground spraying equipment.</p>

                            relations aspects of the defoliation program with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. The Ambassador has obtained <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> concurrence in the State Department's
                            proposals that, at the time of the operation, the Vietnamese Government
                            would undertake appropriate publicity in the form of press releases,
                            public statements and leaflet drops. The publicity would include

                            efforts will be made to advise the inhabitants of affected areas that
                            the spray will have no harmful effects on humans, livestock, or the
                            soil. In response to any press inquiries, U.S. officials would reply
                            along the following lines:</p>
                        <p>"Noting Communist guerrillas use roadside underbrush to ambush civilian

                            asked the U.S. for assistance in a program of clearance of jungle growth
                            along roads of Vietnam. U.S. equipment will be used. Road clearance will
                            aid the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> in patrolling roads to
                            protect people and will facilitate normal <pb n="3" xml:id="pg_3" facs="0023"/>maintenance. Operation involves use of materials which
                            are similar to those used every day for weed clearance along rights of
                            way in the United States. As our people know from experience, these
                            defoliants of the 2-4D variety are not harmful to humans, animals, or
                            the soil. Since there are miles of jungle roads in Vietnam, U.S. planes
                            and personnel are actively cooperating in jungle growth clearance

                        <p>At the meeting with the President, besides the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                            (with General <persName corresp="#p_SBK1">Smith</persName> in place of

                            a summary of the discussion which took place during the meeting:</p>
                        <p>[Here follows discussion of the Department of Defense budget for fiscal

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">South Vietnam</p>
                        <p>There was a discussion of the proposed new command structure for South
                            Vietnam as agreed upon between State and Defense. The President approved
                            the assignment of General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> to the position of senior U.S. commander in
                            Vietnam and his recess appointment to the grade of General. It was
                            agreed that no publicity would be given, at least for the time being, to
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>' new
                            mission.</p>
                        <p>In the discussion concerning South Vietnam the President reemphasized the
                            importance of the U.S. not becoming further involved militarily in that
                            area. The President also emphasized the importance of playing down the
                            number of U.S. military personnel involved in Vietnam and that the U.S.
                            military role there was for advice, training and support of the
                            Vietnamese Armed Forces and not combat.</p>
                        <p>Following a briefing on the proposed defoliant operations, it was agreed
                            that the first step would be for a small-scale application on an
                            experimental basis which would be limited to the first priority road,
                            i.e., a stretch of approximately 35 to 40 miles long.</p>

                        <p>1. Improved planning and implementation of the public affairs and
                            security aspects of our military operations and programs in Vietnam is
                            required. The security and public affairs policy for U.S. military
                            progress in Vietnam is governed primarily by the policy of the United
                                <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0025"/>States toward observance of the
                            Geneva Accords.<note n="2" xml:id="d3fn2">For text of the Geneva Accords
                                of 1954, see <ref target="frus1952-54v16">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1952-1954, vol.
                                    XVI</ref>, pp. 1505-1520.</note> That policy is currently that
                            the United States and the Government of Vietnam have a good, legally
                            sound position to take publicly in response to challenges of increased
                            U.S. assistance to Vietnam. It provides a firm political case for
                            whatever actions may later be judged necessary. This position is as
                            follows: <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is committing sets of
                            aggression in flagrant violation of the Geneva Accords, and the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has consequently requested the United
                            States to provide additional support in men and materiel. These measures
                            are being taken as requirements of legitimate self-defense necessitated
                            by North Vietnamese breaches of the Accords. As soon as the North
                            Vietnamese end their aggressive acts and resume their observance of the
                            Geneva Accords, these measures of support can be terminated.</p>
                        <p>2. … In response to queries U.S. representative will respond as follows:
                            “The United States has acceded to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s
                            request for expanded aid in men and materiel and is determined to help
                            preserve its independence. This is the sole objective of the United
                            States. The United States will terminate these measures as soon as North
                            Vietnam ends its acts of aggression.”</p>
                        <p>3. To ensure that public affairs aspects of operations in Vietnam are
                            consistent with the above policy, adequately planned and effectively
                            implemented, the following procedures should be followed:</p>
                        <p>a. When an action or program with significant public affairs or security
                            implications is planned, the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, in
                            coordination with the Secretaries of the Services providing personnel or
                            logistic support for the operation, will recommend a suitable cover
                            story, or stories, a public explanation, a statement of no comment or an
                            appropriate combination thereof, for approval by the Secretary of
                            Defense. This recommendation will cover the initial call up and movement
                            of forces or material concerned to the area of operations and their
                            subsequent employment. The Service Secretaries will be responsible for
                            coordinating on that portion of the operation which will take place
                            under their authority.</p>
                        <p>b. The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Public Affairs) shall advise the
                            Departments and the Joint Chiefs of Staff of current public affairs
                            policy for Vietnam to guide them in the development of proposed cover
                            stories and public explanations.</p>
                        <p>c. The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Public Affairs) shall evaluate the
                            proposed cover stories or public explanations to insure that they are in
                            consonance with overall policy guidelines developed in coordination with
                            the Department of State.</p>

                        <p>“As I am sure you realized a few weeks ago following the conclusion of
                            the Ambassador's conversations with President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>, a background-briefing was called
                            by the Ambassador at his home <hi rend="italic">for American
                                correspondents only</hi>. I tried very hard to argue him out of this
                            since we have previously come under considerable fire for such a
                            practice. I am by and large against it in principle, although I do
                            understand there may be some very special reasons from time to time for
                            doing it. Personally, I did not think this was one of them. The
                            Ambassador not only conducted the briefing privately in his own home,
                            but he released copies of the Jorden Report<note n="4" xml:id="d5fn4">

                            session, well ahead of the agreed-upon time of distribution the next
                            morning to the entire press corps. I tried hard to object to this, and
                            even in retrospect—the day after—I pointed out to him that this was not
                            the best or most effective press-relations technique. I based my
                            arguments not only on my own experience but on the blasts we had had
                            from the non-American correspondents in Saigon. One of them <pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7" facs="0027"/>even sent back the Jorden Report we had
                            sent him with a little note to the effect that “please strike me from
                            your list of publications and information materials. I no longer need to
                            get my American propaganda from a source which restricts its outlets to
                            its own people.”</p>

                            acceptance of necessity for Naval and Air Force representation on the
                            Joint General Staff, though he stressed personnel shortage would limit
                            size of representation for immediate future.</p>
                        <p>2) Assignment of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> (Civil Guard)
                            advisors to sector commanders (Military Province Chiefs) has begun.</p>
                        <p>C) Intelligence.</p>

                            appearing January 15….</p>
                        <p>3) Assignment US military intelligence advisors awaiting availability of
                            personnel.</p>
                        <p>[D)] Joint provincial surveys: pilot project involving provinces in
                            Saigon area began December 28 with Tay Ninh. Second province scheduled
                            be surveyed beginning January 8.</p>
                        <p>E) Border Ranger Force. December 28 <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said 35 Ranger Companies could not be released for
                            border Ranger force. However, stated II Corps Commander has ten Ranger
                            companies available for border patrol. An additional six Ranger
                            companies now training could also be used, and it possible Montagnard
                            companies could augment Rangers for border patrol. In meantime <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> learned II Corps Commander plans use
                            10 of his 11 presently assigned Ranger companies and considerable <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0032"/>portion 3,000 recently recruited
                            Montagnards to form special battalions for operations in remote areas.
                            Therefore, there no certainty Ranger forces will be made available
                            solely for border operations in near future, though one of several
                            missions these special battalions would be border patrol.</p>
                        <p>F) Military Coordination.</p>
                        <p>1) American helicopter, <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> patrol and
                            Air Force units have for some time been working in coordination with
                            Vietnamese forces. Coordination has been satisfactory and no problems
                            have arisen.</p>
                        <p>2) On Dec 28 <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> agreed to
                            proposed joint tactical air control system and to introduction of the
                            necessary equipment</p>
                        <p>3) <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has agreed to assignment of five
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> advisors per battalion.</p>
                        <p>G) Administration. No additional US advisors have yet been requested to
                            serve with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> civil agencies … .</p>
                        <p>H) In addition those contained pare 6 Embtel 756 following measures to
                            broaden sense of popular participation in war effort have now been
                            taken</p>
                        <p>1) Wide range of economic measures announced by Vice President in Dec 30
                            press conference to put economy on sounder basis should have important
                            austerity effect, hit upper classes harder than lower, and restrict
                            availability luxury items.</p>
                        <p>2) National Economic Council, created in Dec, has been convened to meet
                            on Jan 8.</p>
                        <p>3) Government has announced that henceforth only emergency or sick leave
                            will be granted civil servants.</p>
                        <p>4) Government agencies recently instructed survey personnel needs with
                            view making additional people available for duty in provinces.</p>
                        <p>5) Assembly debates on civil budget showed greater freedom of expression
                            than in past. Speakers did not hesitate to cite government ministries
                            for acts considered inefficient or wasteful, and several deputies flatly
                            accused senior officials of unethical or immoral conduct. Unfortunately,
                            this expansion of assembly's role comes at time when public taking more
                            than usually dim view of body as result passage social purification
                            bill.</p>
                        <p>6) Constitutional Court, another recently created institution, has for
                            first time received (limited) funds for activities. This constitutional
                            review body will probably hear first case this year.</p>
                        <p>7) Military training program for government employees announced late
                            December. Program now getting under way in Saigon area. City also being
                            divided into “self defense” sectors with groups local Republican youth
                            groups responsible for patrol and possible defensive actions.</p>

                        <p>I) Measures to develop more contacts between government and people. As in
                            years past President spent Christmas in countryside, this time visiting
                            two remote <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> posts and island off
                            coast never before visited by Chief of State. Recent acquisition two
                            small helicopters should increase capabilities for informal travel.</p>
                        <p>J) Develop more effective information service.</p>
                        <p>1) Recent appointment well and favorably known Dang Duc Khoi as special
                            presidential press liaison officer big step forward this field. Initial
                            reactions of American journalists highly favorable.</p>
                        <p>2) Official VN Presse coverage security situation has improved in quality
                            and credibility.</p>
                        <p>3) Civic Action Ministry established special information and civic action
                            teams several <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> provinces. <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> info indicates these having good
                            effect.</p>
                        <p>K) Bring non-communist prisoners promptly to trial. No developments.</p>
                        <p>L) Develop and announce an amnesty policy. Early in Dec Assistant
                            SecState for National Defense generally approved an <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> amnesty plan which had been submitted
                            several months earlier. Plan now being translated for Task Force Saigon

                            However, he needs more professional assistance than is likely to be

                            Americans via individual contracts with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, such as took place in Ortiz case. These should be
                            experienced French-speaking press and public relations experts who could
                            work not only in Saigon but in outlying regions. Preferably they would
                            work as elements of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> rather than in
                            advisory “outside” status of incumbent <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> personnel.</p>
                        <p>3. Since best professional talents likely to be found among <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> personnel, would suggest that up to
                            four selected individuals might be made available to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> … . They should be prepared to serve at
                            least one year in Vietnam and expect extensive travel and perhaps
                            residence outside of Saigon. Arrangements would be necessary to insure
                            that neither salaries nor careers in <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> suffer… .</p>
                        <p>4. Aside from assisting <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> relations
                            with foreign press, we would hope these officers would improve <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> relations with Vietnamese press and
                            serve as source ideas and initiative for psywar activities in areas in
                            which they work. Could also substantially assist in proper exploitation
                            of proofs of North Vietnamese infiltration, subversion and covert
                            aggression.</p>
                        <p>5. If this proposal accepted in principle, we will raise with appropriate
                            circles of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to secure <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> reaction. Chance of positive answer
                            seems worth at least initial examination of possible candidates for
                            assignment. Please advise.</p>

                            U.S. command organization in Vietnam made during President's conference
                            with Sec Def and JCS at Palm Beach on Wednesday, 3 <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0035"/>January.<note n="2" xml:id="d9fn2">See

                            basis.</p>
                        <p>2. In attendance at Palm Beach conference were President, Vice President,
                            Sec Def <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, Dep Sec Def
                            Gilpatric, <persName corresp="#p_DGH1">Gen. Decker</persName>, Adm.

                            attend.</p>
                        <p>3. There was a thorough discussion of the situation in Vietnam and of the
                            proposition that a reorganization of the U.S. military set-up was
                            desirable in order to create in the minds of Diem and other Vietnam
                            officials an awareness of the gravity of the situation, the increased
                            support to be furnished by the U.S. and the necessity for greater
                            acceptance on the part of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> of
                            U.S. guidance, advice and counsel. Inherent in the proposed
                            reorganization was the appointment of a senior U.S. military commander
                            with terms of reference which would give him a position of greater
                            authority and influence than that heretofore given the Chief, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. After full consideration of the pros and cons of the proposition, and
                            particularly of the specific terms of reference (quoted below) which had
                            been drafted jointly by the Sec Def and Sec State, the President
                            approved the recommendation of the Secretaries of State and Defense that
                            a U.S. Military Assistance Command should be established in Vietnam at
                            an early date. He approved the terms of reference as drafted. He also
                            approved the nomination of Lieutenant General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> to be commander of the new
                            command with rank of general.</p>
                        <p>5. The question of timing of the release of this appointment was
                            discussed. It was decided that no announcement would be made until after
                            discussions with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> who was due to arrive Washington 5 January.<note n="3" xml:id="d9fn3">Regarding <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>'s visit, January 5-14, see <ref target="#d14">Documents 14</ref>-<ref target="#d16">16</ref>.</note> It now appears that any announcement will be
                            delayed until after return of Amb <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> to Saigon in order to permit him to accomplish

                            would be free to communicate such differences to Washington for decision

                            implement the “Counterinsurgency Plan” developed and approved for all of
                            South Vietnam in 1961 (<ref target="frus1961-63v01#d1">

                            of Vietnam because in the interim the British Advisory Mission had

                            were compatible, but that the Embassy saw merit in avoiding swamping the
                            Government of Vietnam with too much paper at once. Finally, it stated

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Overall Concept of Operations</p>
                        <p>The concept of counterinsurgency operations envisions combined use of
                            political, economic, psychological, military and paramilitary efforts to
                            maintain security and government control and support where they still
                            largely exist (white areas) and to restore them in areas where they have
                            broken down to a greater or lesser extent (red and pink areas).</p>
                        <p>For purposes of definition a red area is considered one where the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> operate with virtual impunity, enjoy the
                            support, voluntary or not, of the populace, and are susceptible of
                            expulsion only through a major military effort. A pink area is one in
                            which the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> are competing for dominance and in
                            which, for example, the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> may control by
                            night and the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> by day. In white areas
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> by and large exercises normal
                            control and <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> activities are mostly
                            harassments rather than more significant actions.</p>
                        <p>It is clear that in each and every province the gamut of security runs
                            from white (at least in the area of the provincial capital) through pink
                            to red. It is also clear that the type of counterinsurgency operations
                            conducted will differ substantially, depending upon the degree of
                            security in a given area.</p>
                        <p>The main considerations which should govern the priority of
                            counterinsurgency operations are the following:</p>
                        <p>1. Every effort should be made to keep existing white areas white through
                            appropriate political, economic, psychological and paramilitary
                            measures. Military forces should not be diverted for use in white areas,
                            but effective paramilitary forces are essential for maintaining security
                            in those areas.</p>
                        <p>2. Simultaneously, to extend security control from white to pink and red
                            areas in application of the amoeba principle, combined political,
                            economic, psychological, military and paramilitary efforts should be
                            mounted on a carefully coordinated, phased basis in successive selected
                            geographical areas. Flexibility is necessary in the choice of these
                            areas.</p>
                        <p>3. At the same time constant pressure should be maintained (essentially
                            by military means) on the Viet Cong in other pink and red areas in order
                            to keep them off balance, and psychological/civic action efforts should
                            be carried out to convince the populace in these other areas that the
                            Government is still aware of their existence. Gradually these areas
                            would become the targets for major coordinated, phased actions of the
                            type outlined in 2, above.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Operational Control and Coordination</p>
                        <p>Planning, control and coordination of all counterinsurgency operations
                            (whether in white, pink or red areas) are a key to success. Policy
                            should be made by the national-level Internal Security Council under the
                            direction of the President. Execution of this policy through planning,
                            controlling and coordinating the combined political, economic, <pb n="19" xml:id="pg_19" facs="0039"/>psychological, military and
                            paramilitary operations should be performed by a Central Director of
                            Plans and Operations under the Internal Security Council. The Secretary
                            of State for the Presidency could serve as this official provided he is
                            relieved of other functions.</p>
                        <p>Security committees should be established at the regional, provincial and
                            district levels, to insure thorough coordination at all stages of
                            operations. These committees will consist of the appropriate officials
                            at each level responsible for military and civil affairs.</p>

                            Counterinsurgency Operations</p>
                        <p>Political, socio-economic and psychological counterinsurgency measures at
                            the local and village level will vary in nature depending upon the
                            degree of security in a given area. These measures are spelled out in
                            Annex B, and are summarized below.</p>
                        <p>In the <hi rend="italic">political</hi> field they include steps to
                            improve the compensation, selection and training of village and hamlet
                            officials; a continued training program for district officials; and the
                            establishment of advisory councils of notables at the village level.
                            These steps appear practical only in white and pink areas, and can be
                            extended to red areas only as they are made whiter.</p>
                        <p>In the <hi rend="italic">socio-economic</hi> field expansion and
                            acceleration of regular village-level programs in areas now white or
                            light pink or which become so as a result of military operations should
                            be conducted in order to demonstrate to the people that the Government
                            offers them real hope for improvement of their living standards. This
                            program should be designed to give <hi rend="italic">each and every</hi>
                            village a basic minimum of government-established facilities. The aim
                            should be to do this within a matter of weeks, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> years. This program should be executed through the regular
                            economic and social ministries of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> down through the provinces and districts. At the top a
                            Cabinet subcommittee would provide for coordination, and at the bottom
                            civilian civic action teams would assist village officials.</p>
                        <p>In addition, certain special programs would be useful in areas where
                            regular programs cannot operate. These special programs include the
                            rural reconstruction teams now operating under the control of the
                            Ministry of Civic Action, special military task forces consisting <pb n="20" xml:id="pg_20" facs="0040"/>of military civic action and
                            psychological warfare teams and protecting troops, similar “hit-and-run”
                            civic action operations by the Ministry of Civic Action, and a special
                            impact flying-doctor program.</p>
                        <p>In the <hi rend="italic">information</hi> field the military
                            psychological warfare forces should be responsible in red and dark pink
                            areas because of the protection required by operating units. This would
                            parallel military responsibility for civic action in the same areas. On
                            the other hand, information activities in existing white or light pink
                            areas and in areas where security has been restored should be handled by
                            the civilian agencies of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.
                            Civilian information specialists should operate in conjunction with
                            civic action specialists working on the breakthrough program at the
                            village level since the most credible information will be that based on
                            actual accomplishment.</p>

                            Operations</p>
                        <p>Major phased, coordinated actions aimed at restoration of security in red
                            and pink areas will center around military operations, but will also
                            require plans and operations in the political, psychological, economic
                            and paramilitary fields (see Annex C for detailed outline). Those
                            actions against any given red and/or pink target area can be visualized
                            in three successive phases: preparatory, military, and follow-up.
                            Careful coordination of all aspects of the action—political,
                            socio-economic, psychological, military and paramilitary—is required at
                            each phase to insure that military effort will not be wasted.</p>
                        <p>Maintenance of security in white areas will also require coordinated
                            action (see Annex D for detailed outline). In these areas the focus
                            should be on providing village and hamlet protection through
                            paramilitary action and helping the villagers to improve their standard
                            of living through socio-economic action. Political and information
                            action should be closely related to these two programs. All of these
                            activities should be executed forthwith and simultaneously if white
                            areas are to be kept white.</p>

                            Operations</p>
                        <p>It is essential to preserve as white areas those areas which are still
                            relatively white, and simultaneous action should be taken in all such
                            areas. This should include, as a minimum, all areas adjacent to
                            provincial capitals, most district seats, and the lowlands area of
                            Central Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>Concomitantly major actions aimed at the restoration of security in red
                            and pink areas through the application of the amoeba concept should be
                            initiated on a selected, successive basis (see Annex E). First priority
                            for such action should be given to those areas which are essential to
                            the continued existence of the Government of Viet-Nam. <pb n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0041"/>To preserve the national entity it may
                            be necessary to give priority to areas which by themselves do not
                            contribute materially to the over-all strength of Viet-Nam, but which
                            are controlled by the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> as potential
                            areas from which to attack. In determining geographical priorities for
                            preserving the base of government and eliminating the treat to security
                            through application of the amoeba concept, several factors will need to
                            be considered (population density, economic importance, area strength of
                            the Viet Cong, suitability to isolation from Viet Cong, etc.). It is
                            believed that on balance first priority should be given to the provinces
                            which surround Saigon to assure a secure primary base for further GVN
                            operations. The second priority should be given to the remaining
                            Southern provinces because of their population, their importance as the
                            rice basket of Viet-Nam and the greater difficulty confronting the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> in that area in reinforcing their
                            strength through large scale infiltration from North Viet-Nam. The red
                            and pink areas in the coastal low lands north of Saigon to the 17th
                            parallel should also be given simultaneous second priority since this
                            area includes a large segment of the population and controls the major
                            route of land communication to the North.</p>
                        <p>This does not mean that other areas are to be neglected. Simultaneous
                            action will continue toward the establishment of a border force aimed at
                            reducing infiltration. Concurrently, major military actions will be
                            taken in other areas against Viet Cong targets of opportunity as they
                            arise, since it is necessary to keep the Viet Cong from consolidating
                            their hold in any area. However, phased across-the-board military,
                            political, socio-economic, and psychological action would be
                            concentrated in the first instance on the area surrounding Saigon.</p>

                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> did receive a 300-page statement
                            on the FY 1962 program<note n="2" xml:id="d12fn2">Not found.</note> and,
                            at my urging, plans to prepare a summary of it for general distribution.
                            The first impression of those who have seen it is that it is not a
                            carefully worked out selective program, but rather a general
                            compendium.</p>
                        <p>The general feeling in Washington seems to be that the <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> tends simply to retail to Washington
                            the proposals it receives from the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.
                            A particular aspect of the program which may be subject to this
                            criticism is <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s road program
                            which the field now proposes that we support. I was assured by the
                            Deputy Director of the <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> who was
                            present at the last Task Force meeting that the MAAG had carefully
                            reviewed the program and concurred in it. However, a member of a
                            military civic action team who talked to a Task Force group last fall
                            was quite critical of the road program both on the general grounds that
                            it was much beyond <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> capacity and on
                            the more specific grounds that past <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            road planning had left much to be desired.</p>
                        <p>Somehow, the Task Force needs to get hold of the economic program and
                            attempt to make some sense of it. One problem in this regard is that,
                            for understandable reasons, the <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> report<note n="3" xml:id="d12fn3">See <ref target="frus1961-63v01#d210">

                            In both cases, I believe, a U.S. proposal has been submitted to the

                        <p>The meeting, which took place in the President's office, was marked
                            throughout by the President's unusually attentive and receptive
                            mood.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> opened the
                            discussion by telling the President that he was leaving the following
                            day to attend a meeting in Hawaii which would be attended by the U.S.
                            Secretary of Defense, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mr.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName>—a special advisor to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>, and by <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> and members of his staff. He
                            explained to the President that there were some matters which would
                            probably come up which could be discussed profitably by the two of them
                            before his departure, with a view to getting the President's ideas
                            before the conference.</p>
                        <p>One of these items was the need for a concrete military plan to defeat
                            the insurgency in Vietnam as a prerequisite to the consideration and
                            authorization of support for an augmentation in Vietnamese forces beyond
                            the presently agreed 200,000. That a concrete, phased <pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0044"/>plan would be evidence that the best
                            possible employment was being made of all forces now in being. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> recalled the plan
                            to the President—describing it as the geographically phased plan which
                            had been developed here prior to General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>'s visit and which was used as a basis for the
                            “Campaign Plan.” That the initial plan had been submitted to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> for consideration at
                            that time. In answer to the President's question about the “Campaign
                            Plan,” General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> said it
                            had been submitted to the <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss> about two
                            weeks ago and that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> had
                            a copy. General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> then
                            reminded the President that a joint <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> study had
                            indicated that there would probably be a need for 15 divisions—amounting
                            to some 278,000 men by the end of 1963. Although he did not want to
                            press President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>, the General
                            suggested that the President's ideas or an approval of the plan would be
                            most welcome. The President agreed to discuss the plan with Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> who would inform
                            General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> of his
                            decision before his departure on the following day.</p>
                        <p>Brief mention was made of the overall Counter Insurgency Plan<note n="2" xml:id="d13fn2">See <ref target="frus1961-63v01#d1">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1961-1963, vol. I,
                                    Document 1</ref>.</note> which had been given to the President
                            by the Ambassador last February and which, of course, was more
                            encompassing than the purely military “Campaign Plan.”</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> next mentioned
                            Admiral Felt's sense of urgency, which he shared, over the increasing
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> build up and the need to contain
                            the threat as rapidly as possible. That in this connection, he felt one
                            of the most urgent tasks was the proper training of military and
                            paramilitary forces. Admittedly, the most serious obstacle to adequate
                            training was operational commitments. The General suggested that if the
                            armed forces were asked to follow the President's example of dedication
                            and the work days were increased to nine hours—six days per week—much
                            valuable time could be gained for training. Also, that the President's
                            declaration of a State of National Emergency constituted a good
                            preparatory move for such an action. The President stated that he
                            thought an increase in work hours to be desirable and promised to
                            consider it.</p>
                        <p>Another item which General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> felt would be discussed at the meeting in Hawaii
                            was the carrying out of a major military operation in Zone “D.” He told
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> that, during the
                            previous meeting at <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>
                                Headquarters,<note n="3" xml:id="d13fn3">See <ref target="frus1961-63v01#d324">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1961-1963, vol. I,
                                    Document 324</ref>.</note> he had briefed the Secretary of
                            Defense on the preliminary plans for this action. That the current
                            status of General <persName corresp="#p_DVMBM1">Minh</persName>'s Plan
                            would therefore be requested due to U.S. interest in a significant
                            military victory as an indication of concerted military action and as a
                            psychological stimulus to the Vietnamese people. It was agreed that Binh
                            Duong Province and Zone <pb n="25" xml:id="pg_25" facs="0045"/>“D”
                            operations were of primary interest because of their importance with
                            regard to the safety of Saigon. When General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> referred to a briefing on
                            these operations which he believed had been given by General <persName corresp="#p_DVMBM1">Minh</persName> to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> and possibly to the President
                            himself, President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> said that
                            General <persName corresp="#p_DVMBM1">Minh</persName> had talked to
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> but that nothing
                            really concrete had been discussed. He added that he would always agree
                            to any plan which would help to achieve a permanent victory but that he
                            felt the Zone “D” operation would still require a great deal of
                            technical analysis and careful consideration by the “technicians” if
                            meaningful long range success were to be ensured. The President stated
                            that failure in such an important engagement could destroy the
                            confidence of his people in the ability of the government to achieve
                            victory, even with increased American assistance and also harm American
                            prestige as well.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> agreed that the
                            Zone “D” operation was a difficult undertaking, but he pointed out that
                            timing was important. Not only would the actual operation take time but
                            the preparation for it must be considered, including a short period of
                            special training for the troops to be committed. To meet the needs of
                            preparation, coordination and execution, at least two or three months
                            would be required. General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> then briefly reviewed the plan for the President.
                            Initially, in accordance with the President's own idea, a blocking force
                            (6 battalions taken from the 5th Division) would isolate Zone “D” from
                            the Province of Tay Ninh by military action in Binh Duang. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> expressed the
                            opinion that Zone “D” was militarily feasible but required immediate
                            action to release the first increment of three battalions and four
                            Ranger companies for two weeks of special preparatory training in
                            unconventional warfare prior to starting the attack. This initial
                            increment would be employed to clear the first designated entrapment
                            area. Subsequent phases requiring additional troops would complete the
                            encirclement of the Zone “D” area on three sides. This would result in a
                            sack being drawn around the area except in the Northwest corner. The
                            phased action in Binh Duong Province would also assist by forcing the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> from the periphery into the center
                            of Zone “D.” In the final phase of the military action, the 23d Division
                            and three or four Airborne battalions would drive Southwest into the
                            pocket to annihilate the enemy. To capitalize on mobility, helicopters
                            would be used to move troops in each phase, to include the movement into
                            position of the 23d Division. Two special helicopter-borne companies and
                            airborne units would stand by to assist wherever needed and to deny
                            access or exit to the entrapment area by the encircled <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. River Forces would assist in a blocking
                            role along the Song Be. In the final phase of the military operation,
                            air bombardment would be carried <pb n="26" xml:id="pg_26" facs="0046"/>out by AD-6's on air alert, directed to the target by radar or by the
                            newly acquired TAC System. The ability to vector planes into the target
                            by radar would give them an all weather capability.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the Zone “D” operation, General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> told the President that with
                            final approval, defoliant would be used in the operation. When the
                            President said that he had given Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> his approval for the use of defoliant several
                            weeks before, General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName>
                            explained that originally, approval from higher American authorities to
                            conduct a test only had been received.<note n="4" xml:id="d13fn4">See
                                    <ref target="#d1">Document 1</ref>.</note> That this test
                            defoliation along Highway 15 from Bien Hoa to Vung Tau could be started
                            as soon as the necessary material, maps and aerial photos were received
                            (about the 12th to 15th January). If approved as part of the Zone “D”
                            operation, it was intended to spray along roads where needed and along
                            the banks of the Song Be. Since the results of killing vegetation
                            requires two weeks, and in some cases, may have to be repeated, it was
                            essential to start as soon as possible. The President agreed.</p>
                        <p>The next major point raised by General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> was the preparation of a plan for the clearing of
                            Viet Cong from a “Test Province.” This had been suggested by Secretary
                            of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> at the
                            December meeting in Hawaii, at which time, the General had understood
                            that the plan could be implemented in any province acceptable to the
                            Vietnamese Government and for which resources could be made available.
                            U. S. authorization for increased Civil Guard and Self Defense Forces
                            strength above presently agreed ceilings would be approved for selected
                            province. After a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of
                            carrying out the “test” clearance in Binh Duang rather than in some
                            other province, the President said that he would interpose no objection,
                            but pointed out that this would be a lengthy operation and would have to
                            be closely supervised over a long period of time. Binh Duong is a
                            heavily infested province with only ten of the forty-eight villages
                            under government control. In his view, initial action of establishing an
                            infrastructure in “defended” villages, already underway, together with a
                            forced resettlement of the people to strategic or more densely populated
                            areas was an act of surgery which would, at first, require a sizeable
                            military force. This resettlement was necessary to ensure that the
                            people would not return to the “bush.” President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> said the final success of this
                            operation would depend on the provision of sufficient bulldozers to
                            permit the clearance of land on which to produce crops by September.
                            This entire action would require about 8-12 months.</p>
                        <pb n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0047"/>
                        <p>Further, the President expressed the thought that Binh Duong could not be
                            considered an isolated operation but must be thought of as part of an
                            overall plan to free the entire crescent formed by the Provinces of
                            Phaoc Thanh, Binh Duong, Tay Ninh, Long An and extending into the Plaine
                            des Joncs in Kien Tuong and Dinh Tuong Provinces. He said that otherwise
                            the province of Binh Duong would not be permanently tenable. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> agreed that to
                            clear and hold Binh Duong Province would require effective, dedicated
                            action by the military, much time and all available national resources.
                            Because of the likelihood that it would be some time before Civil Guard
                            and Self Defense Forces could safely be recruited from the local
                            population, there would be a requirement to station either regular
                            military forces there or that paramilitary forces be taken from other
                            provinces and stationed in Binh Duong. This would violate the basic
                            “local area—home guard” principle of the Civil Guard and the Self
                            Defense Corps. The President said this operation would only be
                            worthwhile if part of a larger clearing action and if backed by
                            necessary construction and road building equipment to carry out the
                            required resettlement plans.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> next told General
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> that his people in
                            Kien Hoa had killed the secret secretary of the Communist Executive
                            Central Committee for South Vietnam and had seized a considerable amount
                            of Viet Cong records. From the seized minutes of a Communist meeting, it
                            was learned that instructions had been issued to increase guerrilla
                            strength in all villages—up to company strength where necessary. The
                            President stated that the documents were being closely examined by a
                            newly created Joint Committee consisting of three members of what he
                            called his <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and three members of the
                                <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> J-2. The new procedure which
                            the President had ordered following his reorganization of the Sureté a
                            week before, was that all seized documents would be screened by the
                            capturing force for information of immediate value and then turned over
                            to the joint committee for careful study. General McGarr commented that
                            this implementation of the proposed Central Intelligence Organization
                            concept was a valuable step forward. Commenting on the information that
                            orders had been issued to the Viet Cong to increase its strength at
                            village level, the General said that this was further evidence that the
                            Communists had to be separated from the people at the lowest level. The
                            President agreed and then went on to say that the seized documents also
                            revealed <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> plans to establish a series
                            of fortified villages in the I and II Corps, particularly in the
                            foothills of the mountains along the coast and that their plan appeared
                            to be to leapfrog these strong points closer and closer to the vital
                            coastal plain. Additional information obtained from the “Kien Hoa”
                            papers was that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> were having
                            serious trouble because of desertions. Their forces were complaining
                            about their physical fatigue, the fact that their families were living
                            in <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0048"/>poverty and neglect, and the
                            idea that they were rarely permitted to visit larger villages to find
                            amusement and relaxation. Further, there was an increasing fear on their
                            part to regroup into larger units because of their vulnerability to
                            artillery and air attack. The overall result was low morale.</p>
                        <p>The President next commented that, in war, one should not expect an
                            unbroken chain of continuous victories. General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> agreed that sound planning
                            must always consider that there will be ups and downs before final
                            victory is achieved. The President then continued by saying that the
                            most immediate action required in Vietnam is in the villages. He spoke
                            of his desire to implement a plan which he admitted to be dangerous but
                            which he considered essential—the establishment of strong posts in the
                            provinces of the Center and in the foothills—patterned after the one at
                            Mamg Buk. These would require helicopter support for supply and relief
                            of personnel, but they would permit <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> forces to radiate and control surrounding areas. This
                            was the original concept of the frontier posts which were too small and
                            inadequately supported—now the President felt that the strategic concept
                            should be adapted to the establishment of 5 or 6 such posts in the
                            Center where the Viet Cong were concentrating their diversionary
                            efforts. General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName>
                            reminded the President that this was the principle of the deep
                            penetration battalions previously agreed upon and the Mobile Forest
                            Forces which <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> had proposed. As for
                            the West, the President stated the need for more and better trained
                            Civil Guard and Self Defense Forces—and the establishment of an adequate
                            infrastructure in the villages. That this would free the Army which
                            would, however, still be needed to fight the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and to clear bases in isolated areas such as the Plaine
                            des Joncs and Cau Mau where the lack of population made the “defended
                            village-Strategic Hamlet” concept absolutely inapplicable. At this
                            point, the President repeated his thought that overall planning should
                            not be restricted to the idea of small augmentations. There should be a
                            mass increase to meet immediate needs. It is easier to demobilize than
                            to recruit and train piecemeal. For this purpose, there was need of an
                            increase in instructors who could train Vietnamese instructors, who, in
                            turn would then train additional cadres. A major problem was the relief
                            of men held too long in combat or in isolated areas. In Malaya the
                            President added, the British had well trained professional soldiers and
                            leaders from outside—and they still had to be relieved periodically. A
                            French Admiral had once told the President that troops, even when
                            fighting a withdrawal action, must be provided with echeloned rest areas
                            or physical fatigue would result in lowered morale and loss of combat
                            effectiveness. General McGarr commented that the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> recommended establishment of the
                            three infantry training regiments <pb n="29" xml:id="pg_29" facs="0049"/>under the 20,000 increase was to meet this specific requirement. He
                            also told President Diem he sincerely hoped they would be trained and
                            used in their intended role of a “rotational training base.”</p>
                        <p>Reverting to the need for leadership, the President commented on what he
                            described as inadequate leadership in some military operations. The
                            cause of this was that commanders had not had enough troop experience
                            and had been advanced too rapidly. In the opinion of the President, the
                            training of company grade officers—to the point where they can clearly
                            understand the capabilities of their men was of utmost importance. Of
                            equal importance was the need for quality as well as quantity in cadres
                            for the Civil Guard and Self Defense Corps.</p>
                        <p>In a somewhat bitter tone, the President next made the statement that his
                            detractors, when they indicated his lack of plans, never mentioned the
                            fact that, for years, he had asked for increased army strength, the
                            establishment of an adequately trained and armed Civil Guard and
                            bulldozers sorely needed in his strategic road building and village
                            infrastructure projects. General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> reminded him that working together, they had
                            succeeded in overcoming objections and obstacles in securing these
                            needed resources, but agreed fully that much valuable time had been
                            lost. The President remarked that we were now paying the penalty for the
                            lost time and stated emphatically that there should be no more delays.
                            He said that contrary to his detractors, he did want a plan. That he
                            would agree to any plan which would lead to victory. He insisted
                            strongly, however, that any plan of action had to be realistic and
                            sustained rather than fast and spectacular.</p>
                        <p>The President next repeated some of the information which had been
                            gleaned from the papers seized in Kien Hoa, adding that the Communists
                            are concentrating on mine warfare. Materials are brought in from North
                            Vietnam and the mines are manufactured locally.</p>
                        <p>Once again, reverting to the subject of plans, the President stated that
                            his problem was not the lack of plans, but the lack of men and means to
                            implement them fully and properly. Another serious handicap was that
                                <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> leadership is not mature.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> assured him
                            that the “Campaign Plan” for which he had suggested approval was a good
                            guide—to which the President responded that ultimate victory depended
                            primarily on assuring the good will of the people. When General
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> repeated that his
                            authorities would like a formal plan in broad terms showing the
                            coordination of effort by all available <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces, the President replied that he would examine it
                            immediately and that he was sure that he could accept it, in principle,
                            since General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> was
                            present in Vietnam during the most critical periods and understood what
                            the problems were.</p>
                        <pb n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0050"/>
                        <p>The next subject raised was that of the implementation of the Border
                            Control Plan which had been agreed during General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>'s visit. The President said
                            that there simply was not enough military strength to meet all
                            requirements and that he could not see how a 5000 man force could be
                            made available at this time, but he did agree that a start should be
                            made along the border between Vietnam and Laos. For this purpose, he
                            agreed to release to General <persName>Dinh</persName> six Ranger
                            companies now in training and to make an additional four companies
                            available to him. The total Ranger strength in that area would then be
                            20 companies, 10 of which, as is now the case, formed into Ranger
                            battalions, the other 10 companies to be used as a border force.
                            (General <persName corresp="#p_NK5">Khanh</persName> feels it will be
                            most difficult to release additional Ranger companies to Dinh at this
                            time because of the battle for “rice” in the Delta.)</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the President again expressed his ideas on plans and
                            reminded General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> that
                            he had been following one for five years. He was convinced that prime
                            importance should be attributed to the establishment of a suitable
                            infrastructure in the villages, since it was at this level that the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> mobilized by terror to separate
                            the people from the government. Before any success could be achieved, it
                            was first necessary to restore confidence by taking care of the problems
                            at the lowest level. Toward this end, he had recently increased the
                            salary of the village notables. In order to establish a workable
                            infrastructure, it was necessary to resettle the people. Following this,
                            energetic action could be taken, but it must be realistic and part of a
                            long range operation.</p>
                        <p>As the meeting ended, the President told General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> that he could assume that
                            approval would be given to the “Campaign Plan,” official concurrence and
                            any possible reservations would be made known to the General by
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>, the next
                            morning.</p>

                                    agreed during the meeting that the Ambassador should have

                                    terms of reference should reflect this relationship. President

                        <p>Following a week of calls and briefings about town, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> from Saigon will call on you
                            at 10:00 a.m., Friday. I gather that all has gone well during his visit
                            except possibly for his early reservations over the changed military
                            set-up in Saigon. Although these have probably been allayed by this
                            time, you may want to ask him how he views his future relationship with

                        <p>On January 12, 1962, from 2:10 until 4:20 p.m., Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> testified in Executive Session
                            before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. He was accompanied by
                            Sterling Cottrell of the Vietnam Task Force and John P. White of the
                            Congressional Relations Office, neither of whom contributed in any
                            substantive way to the discussion. In his opening remarks <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> emphasized the minimal extent
                            of United States involvement in Vietnam and discussed the condition of
                            the Vietnamese Government and the low level of public morals. In
                            response to questions <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>
                            speculated on whether the motivation for the upsurge in Viet Cong/North
                            Vietnamese activity during the preceding 2 years was economic or
                            political, discussed the viability of the <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> regime, expressed his feeling that the situation in
                            Vietnam was primarily the result of Chinese Communist expansionism,
                            commented on biased press coverage in Vietnam, and answered queries from
                            Senator Fulbright on the need for social reform in Vietnam. Some of the
                            discussion was off the record and therefore not recorded. For text of

                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Washington News Leaks:</hi> Anspacher expressed
                            concern about leaks of classified details of U.S. activities in Viet-Nam
                            to the press in Washington. He argued that while it may be necessary to
                            get some things on the public record for the benefit of the American
                            people, it also would be desirable to inform the mission when such a
                            leak is in the making so it can be prepared for press questions there.
                            He also suggested that some people may be merely talking too much and
                            these apparent leaks are actually slips.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> It is true that both leaks and slips
                            have occurred in the Department, the Pentagon and the White House. There
                            is, however, little this agency can do about either controlling such
                            events or alerting the post before the fact. This is a matter that
                            should properly be taken up with the agencies concerned. We have no

                            suggested to the Ambassador that there is a need for American
                            information/psychological operations advisors at the Presidency level in
                            Saigon and at the province level throughout the country. Anspacher
                            contends that while this is probably a proper role for <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>, in practical terms <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> is the Agency with the competent
                            personnel in this field ….</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">3. British Cooperation in the Advisor Field:</hi>
                            Anspacher initiated talks with the British Embassy in Viet-Nam,
                            suggesting that the British and Americans in Viet-Nam concert efforts to
                            improve the whole Vietnamese information/psychological effort here. The
                            British reportedly showed considerable interest and said they would
                            write a letter to the Foreign Office on the subject.</p>
                        <p>
                            <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34" facs="0054"/>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> We think that the U.S. should keep
                            control of the information/psychological operation in Viet-Nam and the
                            British should not be involved at the policy level. If they wish to
                            offer assistance at the operating level we might welcome it depending
                            upon the circumstances and terms of reference. The British paramilitary
                            mission has already caused us trouble by moving beyond its proper
                            role.</p>
                        <p>4. Anspacher also suggested a week-long survey trip by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MER1">Murrow</persName> to look into
                            information/psychological problems the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> faces and to make recommendations on how to solve them.
                            He further suggested that one of the recommendations emerging from such
                            a survey could be the appointment of an American information advisor to
                            the Presidency, as mentioned above.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            has been surveyed by a great number of U.S. missions already. Another
                            one is hardly in order at this time on such a touchy subject. Certainly
                            there is no need for an official of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MER1">Murrow</persName>'s level to get involved in this, although <gloss target="#t_IAF1">IAF</gloss> still is trying to get the Director to
                            the Far East.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Critical News Coverage of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>:</hi> The Ambassador is rather
                            exercised about critical items appearing in the commercial media. He
                            feels that whereas the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is far from
                            an ideal instrument it is all we have to work with and because of the
                            sensitivities in the Palace a critical press has a directly adverse
                            effect on our efforts to get our job done since the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is harder to negotiate with after each
                            critical item appears.</p>
                        <p>A particular case in point is the recent <hi rend="italic">Newsweek</hi>
                            story by Bob Elegant that caused that issue of the magazine to be
                            banned. (Without mentioning <hi rend="italic">Newsweek</hi> he expressed
                            this general view at the Viet-Nam Task Force meeting yesterday.) After
                            the banning of <hi rend="italic">Newsweek</hi> we received a telegram
                            from our <gloss target="#t_PAO1">PAO</gloss> saying that <hi rend="italic">Newsweek</hi> had decided to suspend distribution in
                            Viet-Nam. We sent back a Task Force telegram instructing them to protest
                            this censorship to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. At this
                            point the VOA carried the story on Pham Vuy Co. In his sharp protest to
                            us about the VOA broadcast, the Ambassador referenced our telegram
                            asking them to protest the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s
                            censorship. As you know Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MER1">Murrow</persName> assured the Ambassador that there would be no
                            repetition of this sort of VOA transmission.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AJM4">Anspacher</persName> has counseled the
                            Ambassador that the image of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in
                            the world press can be no better than the face the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> presents to the public and until it is
                            willing to improve its press relations there is not much we can do about
                            it. He also told the <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35" facs="0055"/>Ambassador
                            that our media could not ignore stories that were getting attention in
                            the domestic and foreign press without damaging credibility of our news
                            coverage.</p>
                        <p>We suggest that the following topics might be taken up with Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>:</p>
                        <p>1. What is the Ambassador's view of the role and mission of <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> in such emergencies as exist in
                            Viet-Nam? How far should <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> go in
                            support of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s
                            information/psychological activities? Do we have enough, and the right
                            kind, of personnel?</p>
                        <p>2. What are his views on the problems of relations with foreign (British,
                            French, etc.) correspondents in Saigon? (cf my memo to Mr. Harris of
                            Jan. 4)<note n="2" xml:id="d16fn2">
                                <ref target="#d5">Document 5</ref>.</note> We should take this
                            opportunity to point out the pitfalls of American—only briefings and
                            emphasize the idea that the best way to get a cooperative press is to
                            offer all possible cooperation.</p>
                        <p>3. Is <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>-Embassy coordination adequate
                            in his opinion? Is he getting the support he needs?</p>
                        <p>4. Is Washington support to the information program adequate?</p>
                        <p>5. Should we be looking to an expanded program in the next year?</p>
                        <p>6. Would it be useful to institute an adaptation of the Lao Muong
                            Information Program in Viet-Nam?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> will be

                        <p>1. The preservation of the independence of South Viet-Nam in the face of
                            Communist attempts to take control of South Viet-Nam requires that all
                            arms and agencies of U.S. policy operate in relation to <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0056"/>each other and to the Government of
                            Viet-Nam in intimate and effective coordination. To assure such
                            coordination, the representatives of the various U.S. agencies in Saigon
                            will continue to operate as a unified Task Force under the chairmanship
                            and overall direction of the Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>2. Within this concept, the Senior U.S. Military Commander in South
                            Viet-Nam will have the responsibility for all U.S. military policy,
                            operations and assistance in that country, and the authority to discuss
                            both the U.S. and Vietnamese military operations directly with the
                            President of Viet-Nam and the leaders of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. The Senior U.S. Military Commander will also furnish
                            advice to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> on matters relative to
                            maintaining internal security in South Viet-Nam and to the organization
                            and employment of the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> or other
                            paramilitary forces.</p>
                        <p>3. The Senior U.S. Military Commander will have the title “Commander,
                            U.S. Military Assistance Command—Viet-Nam”.</p>
                        <p>4. The Senior U.S. Military Commander will have direct access to <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> and, through him, to the Joint
                            Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary of Defense.</p>
                        <p>5. The U.S. Ambassador, who as representative of the President is the
                            senior U.S. representative in Viet-Nam, will be kept apprised by the
                            Senior U.S. military commander, in advance, of plans in the military
                            field, in order to assure proper coordination of U.S. activities and
                            advice vis-à-vis the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. In case of
                            differences of view, any member of the Task Force would be free to
                            communicate such differences to Washington for decision in accordance
                            with already-existing procedures.</p>
                        <p>6. While the Ambassador and the senior military commander will keep each
                            other, and where pertinent other members of the Task Force, fully
                            informed on all high-level contacts with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and on major political and military plans, the
                            operational command of U.S. military personnel will be the direct
                            responsibility of the senior U.S. military commander.</p>

                            wishes to make clear that the operational command of U.S. military

                            the point that the Ambassador is the senior U.S. representative, nor
                            that the command responsibility for U.S. Forces in South Vietnam rests
                            with the Military Commander. He does not agree to placing the Commander
                            under the over-all direction of the Ambassador as a member of the
                            Country Team. He feels that this blurs the responsibility for the
                            military program. He would meet this point by clearly setting forth the
                            direct responsibility for military policy, operations, and assistance of
                            the U.S. Military Commander, but would require him to keep the
                            Ambassador informed in advance of his plans for the future so that the
                            Ambassador could appeal to Washington if he disagreed with the U.S.
                            Military Commander.</p>

                            Personally, I do not think there are any great issues at stake, provided

                        <p>a. An interim report by 15 January 1962 of the assessment by the Joint

                            Action with the Government of Vietnam had been met.</p>
                        <p>2. This memorandum responds to subparagraph 1 a above. Subparagraph 1 b
                            was answered by JCSM-321-61, dated 30 November 1961.<note n="4" xml:id="d20fn4">Not found.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. The Joint Chiefs of Staff are of the opinion that the currently
                            authorized nine division equivalent force objective for Vietnam should
                            not be increased at this time. However, provision of 5,000 working
                            spaces in addition to the currently authorized 200,000 man force level
                            is urgently required to provide Chief <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, Vietnam, flexibility in planning for many minor but
                            important force structure changes such as augmentation for the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> school system, support for
                            additional light aircraft, scout dog handlers and cadre personnel for
                            junk and river forces.</p>
                        <p>4. The Joint Chiefs of Staff believe the current pressing military
                            problems are to persuade the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to: (a)
                            train, organize and utilize properly their existing military and
                            paramilitary resources; (b) develop a counter-insurgency campaign plan;
                            (c) implement clearing actions on a province by province basis; and (d)
                            retain control over cleared areas.</p>
                        <p>5. A subsequent assessment by the Joint Chiefs of Staff of strength
                            requirements will reflect <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> capabilities and limitations,

                        <p>6. The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend:</p>
                        <p>a. That the currently authorized nine division equivalent force objective
                            for Vietnam not be increased at this time.</p>
                        <p>b. Approval of 5,000 working spaces in addition to the currently
                            authorized 200,000 man force level for Vietnam.</p>

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> went to very considerable
                            lengths in describing his role in Vietnam beginning in 1922 when he
                            started in as a district official, and eventually rose to be a province
                            chief and Minister of the Interior. As early as 1922, he had made a
                            point of reading communist literature published in Switzerland, and this
                            enabled him to obtain a true insight into the activities of the
                            communists who were active throughout Central Vietnam in the '20s and
                            '30s. Despite the fact that the commies then operated through various
                            front and cover organizations, his knowledge of their techniques enabled
                            him to be always alert, and his anti-commie tactics as a government
                            official soon earned communist enmity.</p>
                        <p>He was extremely critical of French policy at the time. The French
                            government thought that local communists might be a force which could
                            help contain and control the rising spirit of nationalism in Vietnam.
                            This view was a sadly mistaken one. Communists here were actually in
                            touch with Moscow headquarters only through Paris, and the presence of
                            left-wing government in France in the 1930s, and the emergence of the
                            Front Populaire in France in the mid-thirties, was a great encouragement
                            to communist activity and dissidence in all of Vietnam.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> spoke of his early
                            connection with the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> General—Giap—whom
                            he described as a person of great industry with great pride in self.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> and Giap were born in
                            neighboring villages, and <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>
                            had known him, and known of him, for years, despite the fact that Giap
                            is about ten years Diem's junior in age. <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> also mentioned his contacts with Ho Chi Minh, and
                            emphasized the long absence from the soil of Vietnam which had
                            characterized Ho's career.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s anti-colonialist and
                            anti-communist convictions led to his withdrawal from the French civil
                            service, and subsequently to his detention by the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> in the mountainous regions of North Vietnam. He
                            emphasized that for all those forty years, from 1922 to 1962, his
                            anticommunist convictions and purpose had never wavered.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. U.S. Errors</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> mentioned three major errors
                            in United States policy since 1955 with considerable bitterness,
                            although he said that he did not wish to engage in polemics. He implied,
                            however, that present newspaper attacks on him and his regime were
                            designed to cover up these errors of Americans whose careers might
                            otherwise be prejudiced.</p>
                        <p>The first error was the refusal to accept his proposal which he made to
                            the JCS in 1957 in Washington<note n="2" xml:id="d23fn2">Regarding
                                    <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s visit to

                            men. The second error was U.S. insistence on treating the Civil Guard as
                            a rural police force rather than as a military force. This second error
                            had only recently been corrected. The third error was refusal of the
                            Embassy and <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> to accept his program
                            for development of rural roads in 1957. Rapid expansion of the road
                            network was an essential element in the struggle against communism.</p>
                        <p>The President remarked that in the Staley/Thuc Report<note n="3" xml:id="d23fn3">Not printed, but see <ref target="frus1961-63v01#d93">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1961-1963, vol. I,
                                    Document 93</ref>.</note> his road program had been accepted,
                            but that he was still disappointed at the extent of action so far in
                            carrying it out.</p>
                        <p>[The Thuc/Staley Report, in referring to the road program, mentioned the
                            “construction of village roads with heavy use of local labor.” That is
                            all. The implementation of various measures contemplated in the report,
                            of course, is dependent to a large extent on the availability of local
                            currency funds, and six months were required for action by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to take the steps in establishing the
                            fiscal policy contemplated in the Thuc/Staley Report to provide the
                            necessary finances for counter-insurgency efforts in both military and
                            civilian</p>
                        <p>In looking back at the history of the road program, it is important to
                            note that the operations of the American contractors, who constructed
                            three highways designed to meet military priorities as they were then
                            established, resulted in training hundreds of Vietnamese <pb n="43" xml:id="pg_43" facs="0063"/>workers in the use of road-building
                            equipment, starting from scratch. The development of an adequately
                            manned and staffed Highway Department was a prime object of <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> policy from 1958 onwards, and the
                            reluctance of the <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> to provide
                            unlimited new highway equipment was conditioned throughout by
                            considerations of ability of Vietnam to utilize, maintain, and repair
                            equipment with a reasonable degree of effectiveness, as well as by the
                            fact that 2,000 pieces of heavy equipment, used by U.S. contractors,
                            were intended to be turned over to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>—as has been done. Throughout most of 1960, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> had stored near Tan Son Nhut airport,
                            unutilized, great quantities of earth movers bought with their own funds
                            but kept idle pending use for the Da Nhim Dam project. During the summer
                            of 1960, it was reckoned by <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> that
                            the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> engineers could have been 50%
                            more effective in the use of their men and equipment had active steps
                            been taken by <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> to maintain units,
                            30% of which were then deadlined for one reason or another.]<note n="4" xml:id="d23fn4">These and following brackets are in the source
                                text.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The President also spoke with conviction on the need to regroup people in
                            the countryside into defensible units, rather than having them scattered
                            in homesteads remote from one another. Such a regroupment was an
                            essential counter-guerrilla element at the present time, combined with
                            appropriate village guards dedicated to the defense of their homes. Some
                            progress was being made along these lines. He did not agree, however,
                            that it was necessary to pay for the labor involved in this regroupment.
                            It was characteristic of the agricultural economy of Vietnam that
                            following varied activities in connection with the cycle of farm
                            operations' labor had spare time on its hands, and at these periods it
                            could and should be used for community improvements such as were
                            involved in a program of regroupment.</p>
                        <p>He also noted that the government had considered an increase in pay for
                            both Civil Guards and village guards a year ago, but that he had been
                            informed by his financial counsellors that the government could not
                            afford to make increased funds available for these purposes.</p>
                        <p>In another category of criticism which appeared to be directed primarily
                            at <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>, President Diem referred to our
                            reluctance in the early stages of the aid program in 1955 to believe
                            that the Vietnamese, as distinct from French or Chinese, could play a
                            useful and effective role in business enterprise. He pointed out that at
                            that time there were only two Chambers of Commerce in Saigon, one the
                            French and the other Chinese. Efforts which he had made had resulted in
                            the establishment of a Vietnamese business group, who began as importers
                            and who now were established with their own Chamber of Commerce and were
                            working effectively in industry and trade.</p>
                        <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0064"/>
                        <p>[Underlying this criticism, one might detect great sensitivity at
                            frequently expressed American opinion that technical, industrial and
                            commercial problems in Vietnam do require advice at the present time
                            from those trained outside of the country.]</p>
                        <p>In considering the use of military equipment now being made available in
                            such large quantities through U.S. military aid, however, the President
                            took a completely different view. He emphasized that it would be a great
                            error to expect quick results despite the fact that this military
                            equipment is now being made available in admittedly satisfactory
                            quantities. The reason why he could not promise results was that
                            Vietnamese military forces lacked the leadership to put it to full,
                            immediate use. The reason for the lack of leadership was that the French
                            had never trained an adequate number of officers, so that Vietnam was
                            left with the problem of finding enough well trained generals, colonels
                            and majors to mount substantial operations. The officers who are now in
                            command lack sufficient knowledge of the abilities and resources of
                            their troops, and this has led to frequent failures in operations. He
                            sketched on paper, as an example, three columns of soldiers advancing on
                            a given point. He said all too often the estimates of time required for
                            each to reach the given objective were incorrect. The columns either
                            arrived late, or else punctually but at the point of exhaustion, and
                            therefore the operation would be ineffective.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> spoke with very
                            great bitterness of the criticisms of himself and his administration
                            written by journalists who lived off the fat of the land either here or
                            in Hong Kong or in the United States, and who had no responsibility
                            whatsoever for the conduct of the campaign against the communists. He
                            was contemplating writing a letter to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>, asking for President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>'s views on the way to handle
                            such unjustified and unwarranted criticism. He implied that this type of
                            criticism played right into the hands of the commies. Communist
                            propaganda could not usefully and effectively criticize the very

                            <item>Mr. Corcoran and I had a conversation with Dr. Fishel at my house
                                following up the conversation (already reported by memorandum<note n="2" xml:id="d24fn2">Not found.</note>) which I had with Fishel
                                on January 5. The main points emerging from this conversation were
                                as follows:</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>1. Dr. Fishel said that he had now talked, during his two weeks here,
                            with about 100 Vietnamese, of whom only three were supporters of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> Government, and two of
                            those supported it with reservations. He said that these conversations
                            included persons he had talked to on a 4-day trip he has just concluded
                            to the Kontum area, Quang Tri and the 17th Parallel, and the Nha Trang
                            area. Even outside of Saigon he said he often encountered the attitude,
                            “I am willing to fight for my country, but why do it for the Ngo
                            family.” He said he knew 90% of the persons talked to from his 5-year
                            stay in Viet-Nam from 1954 to 1958, and many of them were at that time
                            strong supporters of <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>. He
                            said that these conversations have reaffirmed the impression he
                            expressed during our previous talk about the grave deterioration of the
                            political position of <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> since
                            his last visit in 1959. Fishel said he was so depressed by this that he
                            almost wished that he had not come to visit Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>2. Fishel asked whether I was aware that thousands of officers in the
                            armed forces had been converted to Catholicism because they consider
                            this the way to get ahead under the <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> Government. I told him I had not been aware of
                            this, and he said he received this information from <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s own Father-Confessor, who was
                            one of the original supporters of Diem and told Fishel this in great
                            sorrow. Fishel said that he had direct experience bearing on this point
                            during his travels the past few days in the countryside when a major he
                            had known previously told Fishel about his conversion to Catholicism and
                            cynically <pb n="46" xml:id="pg_46" facs="0066"/>indicated that this was
                            the way to get ahead under this Government. Fishel said he had also
                            learned that three Cabinet ministers have taken up Catholicism,
                            including <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>.</p>
                        <p>3. Fishel described the discouraging, depressing atmosphere among the
                            personnel of the Presidency, most of whom he has known closely for
                            years. He said two of them even described with tears in their eyes the
                            deterioration in the administration of the Government. He said they
                            indicated to him that they are continuing to hold on to prevent “them”
                            (meaning the Ngo family and close adherents) from taking over
                            everything, and in the hope that some kind of change will occur.</p>
                        <p>4. Fishel said that his trip through the countryside had shown him that
                            there are some basically hopeful factors in the situation (for example,
                            the excellent training and morale of the Rangers he saw at the Ranger
                            Training Center in Nha Trang, and the obvious dedication of many of the
                            military personnel whom he encountered on this trip). He stated,
                            however, that the military and economic reforms recently undertaken by
                            the Government will not alone produce any fundamental change in the
                            trend against the Government. What is needed in addition is a
                            psychological shock. When asked just what he thought was necessary he
                            decided to remain discreetly silent (obviously because it comes very
                            hard for him to put forth suggestions adverse to the political fortunes
                            of <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> to whom he has been close
                            for so long).</p>

                        <p>Dear Mr. President: </p>
                        <p>I am presently on my way back to Saigon still unclear in my mind on how
                            the US operation in Viet-nam is to be conducted. You recall <pb n="47" xml:id="pg_47" facs="0067"/>the brief discussion of the matter in
                            our meeting last Friday.<note n="2" xml:id="d25fn2">See <ref target="#d14fn2">footnote 2, Document 14</ref>.</note> In
                            several long discussions with the Secretary of State and the Secretary
                            of Defense, we have been unable to clarify the matter to our mutual
                            satisfaction. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and I
                            achieved at Honolulu what is perhaps an agreement on words, but, I am
                            afraid, not a meeting of minds, which is more important.<note n="3" xml:id="d25fn3">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> subsequently indicated that <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> had stated to him during

                                that his hands were tied on the terms of reference for the commander
                                of MAC by JCS opposition to placing a four-star general in a
                                position subordinate to an ambassador. As a result, the basic
                                problem of who had overall authority to conduct U.S. relations with
                                the Government of Vietnam remained unresolved in <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>'s mind. (Department of
                                State, Office of the Historian, Vietnam Interviews, <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Frederick Nolting</persName>, June 1,
                                1984)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Like everyone else, I am concerned only to find the way to hold Viet-nam.
                            I think this can be done without intervention of US combat forces; but
                            the margin is not great. Clarity of concept, mutual confidence, team
                            work, and a balanced, many-sided effort are required.</p>
                        <p>I believe clear US organizational arrangements are essential to our
                            chances of success. As you know, we must work through and with a
                            sensitive sovereign government and a difficult man. We are trying to
                            help them mount a many-sided effort to win and hold the allegiance of
                            the Viet-nam people. In my view, this is essentially a political job
                            under present conditions. The military component is very important and
                            our military contributions large and increasing, but this fact should
                            not, in my judgment, alter our basic concept nor our basic organization
                            to carry it forward. I feel that one person must be clearly in charge of
                            the conduct of our affairs in Viet-nam and of our relations with the
                            Government of Viet-nam. If that person does not have good enough
                            judgment to stay out of the line of operations of the various US
                            agencies involved, he should be replaced. Especially is this true of
                            military operations. I also think that the concept and function of the
                            US Task Force (or Country Team) in Saigon ought to be continued under
                            the chairmanship and overall direction of the Ambassador to assure
                            proper coordination of US policy and action. Conversely, the ambassador
                            should be held responsible for not infringing the operational
                            responsibilities of the other agency heads, most especially that of the
                            senior military commander.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I believe that the direction you set in your letter to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> (in connection with the
                            Staley-Thuc report),<note n="4" xml:id="d25fn4">See <ref target="frus1961-63v01#d114">

                                    Document 114</ref>.</note> in which you imposed greater
                            authority and flexibility in your representatives in the field, is sound
                            and profitable. I do not think best results can be obtained from
                            detailed direction of the effort from Washington or Honolulu. Needless
                            to say, I consider the vigor and speed put into the <pb n="48" xml:id="pg_48" facs="0068"/>military effort by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and the Defense Department is
                            all to the good, and I hope it will be matched by other agencies to keep
                            the total effort in balance.</p>
                        <p>I write this letter, Mr. President, because I feel there have been
                            differences of view on essential matters of organization bearing on my
                            responsibilities to you and to our government, and that efforts to
                            reconcile them may have left scars. If the views expressed above do not
                            accord with your own, or if there are scars which you think will impair
                            my own effectiveness, I hope that you will tell me so and accept my
                            resignation, which is, of course, readily available. In terms of
                            personal relations with all concerned in this matter (including General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> with whom I had
                            dinner last night), I feel that they are excellent, and that it is
                            essential that they remain so if we are to succeed. A clear
                            understanding on the above matters will, I am confident, assure
                            this.</p>

                        <p>Other department and agency representatives, as deemed necessary</p>
                        <p>The functions of the Special Group (C.I.) will be as follows:</p>
                        <p>a. To insure proper recognition throughout the U.S. Government that
                            subversive insurgency (“wars of liberation”) is a major form of
                            politico-military conflict equal in importance to conventional
                            warfare.</p>
                        <p>b. To insure that such recognition is reflected in the organization,
                            training, equipment and doctrine of the U.S. Armed Forces and other U.S.
                            agencies abroad and in the political, economic, intelligence, military
                            and informational programs conducted abroad by State, Defense, <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. Particular attention will be
                            paid the special training of personnel prior to assignment to <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>'s and to Embassy staffs in countries
                            where counter-insurgency problems exist or may arise.</p>
                        <p>c. To keep under review the adequacy of U.S. resources to deal with
                            actual or potential situations of insurgency or indirect aggression
                            making timely recommendation of measures to apply, increase or adjust
                            these resources to meet anticipated requirements.</p>
                        <p>d. To insure the development of adequate interdepartmental programs aimed
                            at preventing or defeating subversive insurgency and indirect aggression
                            in countries and regions specifically assigned to the Special Group
                            (C.I.) by the President, and to resolve any interdepartmental problems
                            which might impede their implementation.</p>
                        <p>In performing the above functions, the members of the Special Group
                            (C.I.) will act on behalf of their respective departments and agencies,
                            and will depend for staff support upon their own staffs, and upon such
                            country or regional interdepartmental task forces (normally chaired by a
                            State Department Assistant Secretary) as may be established. The Group
                            will confine itself to establishing broad lines of counter-insurgency
                            policy, subject to my direction and decision as <pb n="50" xml:id="pg_50" facs="0070"/>appropriate, insuring a coordinated and
                            unified approach to regional or country programs, and verifying progress
                            in implementation thereof. It will also undertake promptly to make
                            decisions on interdepartmental issues arising out of such programs.</p>
                        <p>The critical areas initially assigned to the Special Group (C.I.)
                            pursuant to paragraph d of this memorandum are set forth in the attached
                            annex.</p>

                        <p>Dear Max: Thank you very much for sending me a copy of the letter you
                            received from <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName>,<note n="2" xml:id="d27fn2">Dated January 3, not printed. (National
                                Defense University, <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> Papers, T-026-69)</note> in Saigon. I have
                            read it with much interest and trust that you will pardon a few personal
                            reflections.</p>
                        <p>While I defer to those who know more about Viet-Nam than I, I am
                            impressed with what seems to me to be the reasonableness of <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName>'s emphasis on the importance
                            of cutting the link between the villages and the guerrillas at the first
                            stage rather than expecting to seek decisive military victories against
                            the Viet Cong regulars. This is, as he points out, a slow, methodical
                            process which will require much emphasis on the Self Defense Corps, with
                            the Civil Guard and the <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51" facs="0071"/>armed
                            forces in a supporting role. However, I am encouraged by his independent
                            assessment that the villages are in the main basically anti-Communist.
                            While there is, of course, nothing new in the thought of strengthening
                            village defenses, I am struck by his thesis that only when the
                            population is protected and a steady flow of good intelligence obtained
                            will it be possible to undertake the elimination of the Viet Cong
                            regular units, and that thus, initially, the role of the Army should be
                            to keep the Viet Cong regular units occupied and off balance. It is my
                            understanding that the French attempted to pursue the opposite
                            course.</p>
                        <p>Such a strategy will, of course, not produce any immediate spectacular
                            results, but my own feeling is that we will have to restrain our natural
                            impulse to expect such results. I known this is also <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Fritz Nolting</persName>'s feeling, and I think
                            he is right.</p>

                        <p>Dear Cot: Encouraged by your letter of thanks for my letter<note n="2" xml:id="d29fn2">Neither found.</note> reporting highlights of the
                            first SecDef Conference last month, I thought I would repeat the
                            performance for the second conference held Monday.<note n="3" xml:id="d29fn3">January 15.</note> However, if you have full access
                            to the Record of the Conference (as you indicated) and feel that my
                            reporting letters are therefore superfluous please let me know.</p>
                        <p>I continue to think the confrontation of Washington, Honolulu and Saigon
                            in an intensive all-day session produces a lot of worthwhile results,
                            not only in terms of SecDef decisions but also in terms of mutual
                            education and enlightenment. The Secretary several times expressed great
                            satisfaction with the accomplishments of PACOM and <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Viet-Nam since the last meeting,
                            particularly for what he called an “extraordinary effort” in the
                            “movement of men and material”. He indicated, however, that at the next
                            meeting he would want to know what results had been accomplished in
                            Viet-Nam by this splendid effort.</p>
                        <p>At one point during the conference General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> presented the views of Diem
                            and Thuan on counterinsurgency.<note n="4" xml:id="d29fn4">For an
                                account of <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s views, see
                                    <ref target="#d13">Document 13</ref>.</note> They felt that all
                            forms of action, including military, should be designed to achieve
                            permanent results. While U.S. efforts are greatly appreciated, we are
                            pushing the young <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> too hard and too
                            fast. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> leadership cannot react as
                            quickly as the Americans wish. American concepts, policies and
                            capabilities do not always fit the oriental mind. Permanent victory
                            depends on restoring the confidence of the people in the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and in themselves. It is necessary to
                            separate the Viet Cong from the people; communism cannot be defeated by
                            military means alone. The U.S. is pushing military plans faster than
                            they can be absorbed, and they cannot achieve permanent results without
                            a long-range approach.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary, I believe, recognized the validity of these <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> views, for he said we must move
                            speedily to support <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s
                            program. He stressed the importance of holding on to areas that have
                            been cleared militarily. He also recognized that the process of clearing
                            and <pb n="53" xml:id="pg_53" facs="0073"/>holding would be a long one.
                            Thus in approving a 12 1/2 million dollar communications package for
                            Viet-Nam, he commented that the U.S. would probably be involved in
                            Viet-Nam for a long time.</p>
                        <p>While agreeing entirely with Diem that permanent victory cannot be won by
                            military means alone, and that to hold areas cleared militarily the
                            necessary “civic” infrastructure must be installed, I am skill convinced
                            that the most urgent need now is to strengthen the military (including
                            paramilitary) capabilities of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.
                            It does not yet appear capable of clearing and holding a substantial key
                            area (such as the province of Binh Duong) without drawing off military
                            forces from other areas to an unacceptable degree. It must reach at
                            least this level of capability before the tide will turn.</p>
                        <p>I have summarized below some of the other principal decisions and
                            opinions of SecDef.</p>
                        <p>On <hi rend="italic">defoliants</hi> the Secretary wanted further
                            experimentation to continue so that we could ascertain how effective the
                            spray was on all types of vegetation. Only when this was done would we
                            have a sound basis for judging the operational effectiveness of
                            defoliants.</p>
                        <p>In discussing <hi rend="italic">training and personnel</hi> the Secretary
                            manifested great interest in speeding up the arrival of advisers. He
                            wanted them to get out to Viet-Nam as fast as they could be processed in
                            Washington, even though the Vietnamese units to which they were to be
                            assigned were not yet ready to receive them. He agreed with General
                            O'Donnell that too many of our military personnel in Viet-Nam are on TDY
                            with the result that tours are too short. More personnel should be sent
                            on PCS rather than TDY.</p>
                        <p>There was considerable discussion of the <hi rend="italic">Civil Guard
                                and Self-Defense Corps</hi>. Both the Secretary and General
                                <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> felt the <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>
                            should be given high priority attention. The Secretary expressed the
                            opinion that the order of priority for expansion of size and training
                            should be the <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>. He wanted
                            recommendations on this by the next meeting.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary also wanted to get <hi rend="italic">carbines</hi> into the
                            hands of the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> as soon as possible.
                            Rather than wait for the completion of a 12-week training cycle before
                            such weapons are issued to an <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> unit,
                            he suggested they be issued following a preliminary training phase just
                            sufficient to teach them how to handle these weapons. He authorized the
                            shipment of another 40,000 carbines to Viet-Nam (in addition to the
                            37,000 already on hand there) for the use of any <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> military or paramilitary units which could properly use
                            them.</p>
                        <p>During discussion of the <hi rend="italic">province survey teams</hi>,
                            the Secretary expressed regret that these teams were being confined to
                            military and intelligence matters. He wanted the American members of the
                            teams to send in comprehensive reports as soon as possible (without
                            waiting <pb n="54" xml:id="pg_54" facs="0074"/>for the combined
                            US-Vietnamese report) which would give the American members'
                            observations on political, economic, civic action and other matters as
                            well as on military and intelligence questions.</p>
                        <p>There was considerable discussion of <hi rend="italic">plans for clearing
                                and holding a single province or area</hi>. It was decided to
                            eliminate Zone D as an immediate target, since it did not lend itself to
                            the concept of clearing with the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>
                            and holding with civic action teams, <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>, being a sparsely populated,
                            heavily forested area. Moreover, its military significance has decreased
                            with the apparent evacuation of the Viet Cong “Nambo headquarters”. The
                            Chief <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> is to work up a plan for
                            clearing and holding an area where permanent results can be achieved.
                            Such an area may or may not be confined to one province.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary expressed great concern about the <hi rend="italic"> US
                                press treatment of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            </hi>. He felt that the pessimistic anti-<persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> line of the press was hurting our cause with
                            Congress and the public. He directed that we step up public information
                            programs at all levels—Washington, Honolulu and Viet-Nam. He left to the
                            judgment of CINCPAC and Chief <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
                            Viet-Nam what could be declassified to assist in these programs.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Fritz Nolting</persName> cautioned that
                            in briefing the press we should give full credit to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and not make it look as though the U.S.
                            were running the war in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, making the
                            plans, or pulling all the strings.</p>
                        <p>In a brief discussion of <hi rend="italic">aid from third countries</hi>,
                            Admiral Felt mentioned the interest of the ROKs in sending some of their
                            forces to assist the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. The
                            Secretary's reaction was that we would have to pay for this, and we
                            might as well pay the Vietnamese to do the job themselves. As for
                            Australian help, however, the Secretary said that if it were politically
                            wise to accept Australian help we should do so. General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> said he would be glad to
                            have small numbers of Australians if they were willing to serve under
                            the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Sincerely,</p>
                        <p> Ed </p>
                        <p>P.S. It strikes me that the concern expressed in Deptel 890 to

                            concern that we may be missing opportunity for contribution by military
                            forces to socio-economic development and his hope that civic action
                            projects can be included in <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> programs wherever practicable.
                            Directive requires report to NSC by 31 March regarding programs built
                            into FY 62 aid programs and by September 1 on activities included in FY
                            63 program.</p>
                        <p>To spur civic action effort and be in position report resultant progress
                            by 31 March, it is proposed that in immediate future (early February)

                            selected countries designated for development pilot programs. Teams
                            would work with country team to assist in organization for new or
                            expanded civic action effort. Though scale of activity and expenditures
                            would necessarily be modest for FY 62, any required financing would be
                            additional to presently scheduled assistance.</p>
                        <p>Civic action defined as use indigenous military forces for projects
                            useful to the populace in such fields as training, public works,

                            been converted to Catholicism, is incorrect. There has been only one
                            conversion to Catholicism among the Cabinet Ministers, and that is Huynh
                            Huu Nghia, Secretary of State for Labor.</p>
                        <p> Fishel said that he also believes that the earlier information that
                            “thousands of officers in the armed forces” had been converted to
                            Catholicism is an exaggeration. Nevertheless, he said that the best
                            information he has been able to get indicates that the number has been
                            large. It has often been based on the expectation that promotion comes
                            faster to Catholics, but he has heard that this is by no means
                            necessarily the case, since he has been told that Catholics are often
                            passed over.</p>
                        <p>In passing along this correction, Fishel specifically said that he had no
                            reason to change any of the other information or conclusions which he
                            had given me earlier.</p>

                        <p>Dear Bill: The January 21 attack on a Cambodian village by Jungle Jim
                                aircraft<note n="2" xml:id="d32fn2">Telegram 956 from Saigon,
                                January 24, reported that U.S. Jungle Jim aircraft, carrying mixed
                                U.S. and Vietnamese crews, had mistakenly attacked a Cambodian
                                village while on a mission against a Viet Cong concentration in an
                                area west of Binh Hoa. (Washington National Records Center, RG 84,
                                Saigon Embassy Files: FRC 68 A 5159, SGN (62)19, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, Jan-Jun)</note> has greatly
                            increased our concern over the implications of recent messages from the
                            Chief <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> in Saigon concerning the use
                            to which these aircraft are being put in attacking villages in Vietnam.
                            While we must heavily rely on the judgment of the people on the spot in
                            the selection of suitable aircraft targets, it seems to us that the
                            error made with respect to the attack on the Cambodian village and the
                            civilian casualties resulting therefrom, point up the extreme difficulty
                            of selective use of air power against native villages.</p>
                        <p>I note, for example, in recent CHMAAG VN SITREPS that in response to
                            VNAFL-19 identifications, apparently similar to those in the case of the
                            Cambodian village, napalm bombs, rockets and 50 caliber ammunition have
                            been employed against villages. Our fear is that unless identification
                            of the target is very certain, the civilian casualties resulting from
                            such air action may do severe damage to the basic objective of winning
                            the people to the side of the government against the Viet Cong, whether
                            or not the village is willingly or unwillingly sheltering some Viet
                            Cong.</p>
                        <p>I fully appreciate the extreme difficulty of identifying targets and
                            assuring that only Viet Cong are the victims of attack. However, the
                            stakes of winning the population to the side of the government are so
                            great that it seems to me we should err on the side of caution in the
                            selection of targets. It does not seem to me that we can afford to
                            alienate people in the countryside even though at the moment it may
                            appear that they are temporarily controlled by the Viet Cong. I would
                            hope that our guideline could continue to be to separate the Viet Cong
                            from the people, not to destroy people as a byproduct of the effort to
                            kill the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <pb n="58" xml:id="pg_58" facs="0078"/>
                        <p>If you agree, I suggest that it would be desirable to have this point of
                            view translated into appropriate instructions to the military commanders
                            concerned.</p>

                            similar to present relationship-i.e., Ambassador would be senior US
                            representative, US Commander would work in close contact and

                        <p>The outcome in Vietnam depends primarily on the risk analyses and
                            resultant policies of the Communist Bloc and the United States. The
                            current situation is the natural result of the opposed policies, marked
                            by mutual caution. The Communists regulate their attack to preserve its
                            ambiguity and avoid prompting increased external assistance for the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, and the U.S. limits its support
                            to avoid being directly involved in combat. While these policies
                            continue, the efficiency with which the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> conducts the campaign against the Communists is a
                            decisive factor. The effectiveness of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will depend, as long as he remains in office, almost
                            directly on the performance of President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>. This paper is an analysis of the prospects for
                            success in Vietnam under President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Characteristics</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> directly reflects the personal
                            characteristics and philosophy of President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>. It is allegedly a corrupt government, but charges
                            of high-level corruption have not been substantiated. Corruption may
                            exist, but with the possible exception of Malaya, it is probably the
                            least corrupt government in Southeast Asia. It is certainly
                            authoritarian and over-centralized. It is not a popular government to
                            which the population rallies in spontaneous support. This results in
                            part from President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s aloof
                            paternalism, and in part from the characteristics of the Vietnamese
                            people. It is not an efficient government, but it has provided for its
                            severest critics a demonstration of progress in the face of adversity.
                            This progress is a testimonial of President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s ability and a clear indication that South Vietnam
                            would have continued to prosper and develop under his leadership in <pb n="61" xml:id="pg_61" facs="0081"/>normal times. The added burden of
                            the growing Communist attack has arrested progress—not the deficiencies
                            of President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s
                            administration.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> is a man of notable
                            strengths, admired for his austere dedication and courage, but he is
                            also handicapped by several unswerving convictions which are critical
                            weaknesses in the present phase of the emergency. They directly affect
                            his capability to manage the military campaign in Vietnam. Only these
                            weaknesses need be examined for the purposes of this paper.</p>
                        <p>First, he is psychologically unable to delegate authority. Suspicious of
                            the loyalty of all but a few of those around him, he deprives himself of
                            required assistance and governmental efficiency inevitably suffers. He
                            foregoes the services of able men who have incurred his displeasure and
                            treats subordinates so harshly that they are overawed and afraid to
                            present their views or unpleasant facts. In sum, though outstanding in
                            personal ability, he lacks the characteristic of leadership most vital
                            in the current circumstances—the ability to tap the superior collective
                            capabilities of his subordinates.</p>
                        <p>He is unable to compromise. This rigidity has lost him the support of
                            nationalist politicians and impeded his conduct of foreign relations.
                            But this characteristic has also been responsible for his most notable
                            achievements in developing and unifying South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>He has illusions of omniscience. He is mandarin by training and
                            inheritance. This, coupled with his natural personality, results in a
                            reserve that can not arouse spontaneous public enthusiasm. In the
                            society of Vietnam and during the current emergency, this characteristic
                            may not be as serious a weakness—if a weakness at all—as it is sometimes
                            considered to be by American observers incapable of empathic analysis.
                            However, the real significance of this background is his growing
                            conviction of self-righteousness.</p>
                        <p>A series of experiences wherein he has rejected advice outright and later
                            been proven right left a lasting impression with <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>. Some observers believe that he
                            now is convinced that he enjoys something close to divine guidance. The
                            following are selected important examples: In 1955, he attacked and won
                            against the sects despite conflicting recommendations of some U.S.
                            advisors. He was undoubtedly aware that General Lawton Collins had at
                            that time recommended his replacement by someone more acceptable to the
                            sects and the French.</p>
                        <p>He saw the U.S. country team accept during 1960 his long-standing and
                            long-opposed recommendations for the training and support of the Civil
                            Guard along lines emphasizing their military rather than police
                            function. At the same time his equally long-standing plea for increase
                            of the Vietnamese armed forces was recognized. Moreover, for several
                            years he had tried to convince both responsible U.S. officials resident
                            in Vietnam and those who came as visitors that the <pb n="62" xml:id="pg_62" facs="0082"/>internal security situation in Vietnam
                            was a grave problem. U.S. actions in 1961 were [a] tacit admission that
                            the threat existed as <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> had
                            contended. And finally, until 1960, in the administration of the
                            Military Assistance Program <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>
                            gained the impression that U.S. officials believed that their problem
                            was to prepare the VN armed forces to resist external aggression in a
                            role consonant with U.S. contingency plans while the problem of
                            counter-insurgency was not a basic U.S. concern. He has long understood
                            and been alert to differences of opinion within the country team. This
                            knowledge of conflicting opinion—even conflicting advice—has affected
                            his evaluation of advice received.</p>
                        <p>As a result of these experiences, he is cautious of U.S. advice. He is
                            also probably incapable of concluding that the best interests of Vietnam
                            would be served if he relinquished power.</p>
                        <p>From the attempt by the Chief of the General Staff to overthrow the
                            government soon after <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s
                            appointment as Premier, he has retained the conviction that military
                            authority must be splintered and focused only in his own hands. His
                            survival against coups and plots testifies to the effectiveness of the
                            control that he has maintained, but the development of leadership in the
                            armed forces and their efficient employment have seriously suffered as a
                            result.</p>
                        <p>He lacks military background. He has had little experience, even by
                            observation, with the proven principles of military management. He has
                            no real conception of staff work. When seeking recommendations from his
                            own military officers he either goes to a selected individual, often
                            heading the last men with whom he has spoken, or has a convention of all
                            the Vietnamese Generals. At these latter formations “face” is at stake
                            and generals of limited ability state sweeping generalities without the
                            benefit of facts that normal staff procedures could develop. The faulty
                            decisions thus derived have deepened <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s mistrust of the ability of his military
                            subordinates.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Prospects</p>
                        <p>The Communist campaign against the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is
                            now clearly in a critical phase because a series of reverses suffered by
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> could cause a collapse of the
                            will to resist before the effects of the measures to improve security
                            now approved are felt. Only effective employment of all available
                            military resources can assure a reasonable chance of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> survival. Continuation of past
                            practices by President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> in
                            handling of the military program would almost certainly seal the fate of
                            Vietnam. The absorptive capacity of Vietnam for U.S. aid can only be
                            increased to a limited extent—and that increase depends largely on
                            efficient utilization of the resources being made available by the
                            U.S.</p>
                        <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0083"/>
                        <p>Attention then centers on the possibilities—and methods to realize
                            them—of causing President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> to
                            accept advice and reforms. Past performance in this regard is not
                            encouraging. The reforms of military significance which are now being
                            urged upon <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> by U.S.
                            representatives are the same ones that have been urged upon him for at
                            least five years. Gradual progress has been made, but significant reform
                            can not yet be identified. There are a series of encouraging signs, but
                            each must be examined closely to determine whether it is a superficial
                            or fundamental change. Unfortunately, the time required to observe
                            reliably whether important changes are actually being made by <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> can not be risked. Recent creation
                            of a national security council has been evaluated as an encouraging
                            sign, but essentially the same body was in existence even before Chief,
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> first formally proposed it to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> 13 April 1960. But
                            its function was then described by participants as one where the
                            “ministers assembled to take notes and not to talk”. At the same time,
                            creation of a central intelligence agency was proposed. It appears that
                            real progress is being made with this vital program though the
                            appointment as chief of the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> by
                            President Diem of an officer whom he had relieved from responsibility
                            for the delta area, leaves doubt as to whether he will now permit a
                            single effective intelligence agency.</p>
                        <p>Most discouraging is the matter of delegation of authority to military
                            commanders. Since assignment to the <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss>
                            Field Command of responsibilities for control of field operations was
                            recommended in 1959, no real control has been delegated. And more
                            important, the position—and personality—of the Chief of the General
                            Staff remain unchanged. As commander of all of the armed forces, his
                            role should be more significant than that of the <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss>, Field Command. The steadfastly loyal but incompetent
                            incumbent remains, not permitted to retire despite his personal desires,
                            and serving no useful function except to exert a stabilizing influence
                            on younger generals and restrain them from plotting against their
                            superiors. Any real intention to place the military establishment on a
                            sound basis must begin with the appointment of a functioning military
                            chief.</p>
                        <p>The question of removal of the province chiefs from the chain of command
                            is debatable. Arguments have been presented to support both sides.
                            However, U.S. officials have steadfastly urged over the years that the
                            authority of the province chief be curbed. There is little indication
                            that the U.S. view is now being accepted.</p>
                        <p>Opinion of U.S. representatives over the years has been divided on the
                            feasibility of exerting pressure on President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> to cause him to adopt reforms. It
                            has been generally held that an ultimatum to withhold aid could not be
                            effective because <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>, fully
                            aware of U.S. national interests involved in Vietnam, and knowing that
                            the U.S. could not afford to let Vietnam fall, could not be bluffed.
                            Only in the <pb n="64" xml:id="pg_64" facs="0084"/>current critical
                            phase has an U.S. ultimatum been credible. It has become credible
                            because only in the present deteriorating situation was it plausible
                            that U.S. officials were convinced that Vietnam would fall unless
                            reforms were made. President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>'s message to <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> following the <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> mission<note n="2" xml:id="d35fn2">Regarding this

                            judging by VN press reaction, was interpreted to be an ultimatum.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> did not yield. No
                            fundamental concessions were made, and U.S. officials made clear that no
                            ultimatum was intended. While it can not be assumed that Diem would have
                            yielded had the U.S. position been resolutely maintained, it is highly
                            probable that no future ultimatum would be seriously regarded.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Alternatives</p>
                        <p>A U.S. policy toward <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> based on
                            compulsion through regulation of the level of U.S. assistance can not
                            succeed. The crisis in Vietnam is presently too grave—and time is too
                            limited—to determine whether Diem is now making the substantial changes
                            in his administration that he has through the years declined to make
                            except in superficial form. But changes must be effective if South
                            Vietnam is to have reasonable chances of weathering the current crisis.
                            There are consequently only two general lines of action: (1) to seek
                            replacement of <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> and (2) to
                            seek more effective means of influencing him.</p>
                        <p>Replacement of <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> would gravely
                            risk chaos at a time when chaos can only benefit the Communists. Though
                            a replacement could be found in Vietnam, as in every nation in every
                            age, the stakes involved in engineering a change that could not be
                            directly controlled to ensure smooth transition are too great to risk
                            now.</p>
                        <p>Means to influence <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> then must
                            be sought. Two general areas are most promising—to send senior U.S.
                            officials to Vietnam in whom Diem has confidence and to seek to increase
                            his confidence in U.S. advice through gradual but clear demonstration of
                            its value. The first promises most immediate results. On the military
                            side, individual military ability of the senior U.S. military
                            representative is of secondary importance in comparison with his ability
                            to gain quickly the confidence of <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>. Through the years even the most junior member of
                            the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> has quickly recognized the
                            deficiencies of the VN military establishment and no unusual
                            qualifications are required to formulate a program for their correction.
                            But the military representative in Vietnam is the member of the country
                            team on whom <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> will most rely.
                            If the military representative is accepted in <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s “inner group” he will have
                            value; if not, he could not succeed though he were a military genius. In
                            the present crisis, selection of an individual whom <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> has known and in whom he already
                            has confidence is the most <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65" facs="0085"/>promising alternative. Regardless of whether an effective senior U.S.
                            military representative is assigned, progress can be made by
                            demonstration that U.S. advice is sound and that recommended methods are
                            applicable in Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> will
                            respond to proven successes, particularly if U.S. proposals are tailored
                            to his situation. For example, with full knowledge that Diem will not
                            accept a proposal concerning the military chain of command that would
                            dangerously increase his vulnerability to a coup, U.S. representatives
                            must tailor their recommendations accordingly. They must seek to include
                            in their recommendations provisions—checks and balances—which are a
                            compromise acceptable to Diem. Otherwise only a paper facade will—as in
                            the past-result.</p>
                        <p>In these two areas lies the greatest promise of effective U.S. action at
                            present. A third consideration might be to give <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> full ungrudging support of his
                            programs once he has made his decision. Even though he may not have
                            accepted U.S. advice, once he has made his decision he should have full
                            U.S. support. The U.S. cannot now disassociate itself from <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s success or failure. It is in our
                            interest to ensure that he succeeds even in programs which do not fit
                            our conceptions.</p>

                            new U.S. Military Assistance Command; said he had explained idea to
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> thoroughly; that
                            President wanted to see me about it. I asked whether there were any
                            particular questions or problems in his mind. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said the only problem that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> seemed to have was
                            whether the U.S. Mission in Viet-Nam was to have “one or more heads”. He
                            said from point of view <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> it was
                            essential that U.S. activities should head up to one person in Viet-Nam.
                            I told <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> need have no <pb n="66" xml:id="pg_66" facs="0086"/>concern on this score; as to details,
                            this was a matter of internal U.S. arrangements which would, I felt

                        <p>Thank you for sending me a copy of your thoughtful analysis of President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> and his relationship to
                            military problems in Vietnam. It has a depth of perception unusual for
                            an American military observer of a political personality!</p>
                        <p>While you have included some hints of it in your paper, the main U.S.
                            failure in working with President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> has been our many attempts to squeeze him into an
                            American-type mold labeled “Chief of State.” Most of the Americans who
                            attempted to do this had only the foggiest notion of what is needed in a
                            Chief of State, not only in Vietnam, but elsewhere (including the U.S.).
                            Thus, <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> has come to <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0087"/>view most Americans as meddlers and
                            quite naive meddlers. His long talks with U.S. officials, which they
                            find so boring, are usually his attempts to inform them of even the
                            rudiments of local truths.</p>
                        <p>His real American friends, the ones he trusts, have always been able to
                            speak to him with naked honesty about local problems—as long as they
                            speak from first-hand knowledge. Whenever he has asked my views about a
                            problem I knew little about, I always have told him I would have to look
                            into it first; after I have done so, he has listened intently to what I
                            have said, even when it was unpalatable. His trust and friendship for
                            General Williams was based on this same principle. General O'Daniel
                            arrived at much the same status with <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>. On the other hand, those Americans who just
                            carried tales or seemed to be mere flunkeys for the personal whims of
                            U.S. officials, lost their credibility with <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>—even when he still had an affection for them as old
                            acquaintances. This is hardly unique among leaders of nations.</p>
                        <p>On page 4, in the last paragraph, you note an adverse reaction in the
                            Vietnamese press to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>'s message to <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>. This simply is not true. Yes, there was a bad
                            reaction in the press to U.S. proposals after the <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> mission. But, these were not
                            reactions to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>'s
                            message. They were reactions to a rather naked grab at taking away
                            sovereignty from the Vietnamese, in the terms State instructed
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> to present to
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>. In a top-level meeting,
                            after the Vietnamese reaction was noted in Washington, I pointed out the
                            offending language in the message and asked if it expressed U.S. policy.
                            Our policy-makers (including Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>) seemed surprised at the inclusion of the
                            offending phrases, said that this was not U.S. policy, and sent new
                            instructions to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> correcting the U.S. proposals.<note n="3" xml:id="d37fn3">Regarding this issue, see <ref target="frus1961-63v01#d257">

                            was far too much of a “set piece” and was not an effective form of

                        <p>On 3 January 1962 you authorized initiation of limited experimental
                            defoliant operations in Vietnam.<note n="2" xml:id="d41fn2">See <ref target="#d1">Document 1</ref>.</note> These defoliant
                            operations, conducted 13-16 January 1962, included spraying selected
                            segments of road totaling approximately 16 miles along Vietnamese Route
                            Number 15 between Bien Hoa and Vung Tau. A second spraying of each area
                            covered in the initial operation will be required approximately three
                            weeks after the first spraying. Conclusive evaluation of this experiment
                            can be made only after the effects of the second spraying are
                            observed.</p>
                        <p>The Vietnamese Government carried out a simultaneous public information
                            campaign in the test area. To date there have been no adverse reactions
                            in South Vietnam to the defoliant operations. Foreign reaction in
                            non-Communist nations has been relatively light. However, on 21 January,
                            Radio Moscow accused the U.S.-Diemist clique of ordering a chemical
                            warfare plan to destroy food in South Vietnam. Radio Peking also
                            mentioned the subject on 13 January 1962, and various themes have been
                            used recently by the North Vietnamese. On 19 and 24 January 1962 Radio
                            Hanoi broadcasts emphasized the destruction of natural resources and of
                            crops by toxic chemical spraying. This is an intensification of
                            Communist propaganda noted as early as 6 November 1961.</p>
                        <p>The great variety of vegetation found in Vietnam includes species never
                            treated in previous herbicide tests. The limited areas already sprayed
                            do not include the variety of vegetation and conditions required for a
                            full evaluation of the effectiveness of the chemicals employed and
                            possible operational concepts for their use. It is important <pb n="72" xml:id="pg_72" facs="0092"/>that we test all conditions of
                            vegetation, as well as the effectiveness of defoliant techniques in
                            specific situations, before proceeding with a larger scale program.</p>
                        <p>To provide the diversified test data needed for full evaluation, CINCPAC
                            and Chief, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, Vietnam have
                            recommended extension of the test program to include six additional
                            specific target areas. These targets have been selected to demonstrate
                            the operational effectiveness of defoliants against types and
                            combinations of vegetation not found in the areas already covered and
                            also to demonstrate defoliant effectiveness in specific situations. The

                        <p>1. Route from coast to Father Hoa Base at Binh Hung (4 miles).—The
                            vegetation of this area is mangrove. Also defoliation will clear a route
                            from the coast which could be secured by Father Hoa's troops, so that
                            cargo now being air dropped could be moved by lighter from coastal
                            vessels to the beach, and thence to Binh Hung.</p>
                        <p>2. Bien Hoa Air Base perimeter.—The security of the air base requires
                            that fields of fire and observation be cleared in the area. The
                            irregularity of the features of the base will demonstrate the precision
                            with which spraying missions can be flown. The vegetation includes mixed
                            scrub, tropicaI grass, bamboo, and softwood trees.</p>
                        <p>3. Nham Go Air Field perimeter.—Eliminating surrounding vegetation at
                            this small strip will show to what degree the requirement for security
                            troops is reduced through defoliant operations. Vegetation of this area
                            is dense broad leaf evergreen forest. There is high continuous canopy
                            over intertwined woody vines and dense evergreen undergrowth.</p>
                        <p>4. Than Tuy Ha Ammunition Dump area.—This ammunition dump is vulnerable
                            to sabotage. Vegetation clearance will improve observation. The
                            vegetation within the depot area is low, moderately dense mixed scrub
                            and rank tropical grass.</p>
                        <p>5. Route Number 1 (9.5 mile segment).—The vegetation along the previously
                            sprayed segments of Route 15 was mainly mixed scrub growth, palmgrove
                            and scattered hardwood trees. The proposed segments of Route 1 and Route
                            14 (target 6) will cover the majority of other principal species of
                            vegetation found in South Vietnam. The dense rain forest with moderate
                            undergrowth found along the Route 14 segment is generally typical of the
                            plateau region of Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>6. Route Number 14 (7.5 mile segment).—The vegetation is mainly open
                            forest with heavy undergrowth.</p>
                        <p>It is recommended that extension of the present experimental defoliation
                            program, as described above, be authorized. The Department of State
                            concurs in this recommendation.</p>

                        <p>Present Viet Cong strength in South Vietnam is as follows:</p>
                        <p>a. Regular forces—12,600</p>
                        <p>b. Irregular forces—13,300</p>
                        <p>c. Supporters and sympathizers—100,000</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Character of Viet Cong Forces.</p>
                        <p>The regular forces are full-time, relatively well-trained and equipped
                            personnel. The cadres for the regular forces are frequently from North
                            Vietnam, but the bulk of the personnel is recruited and trained
                            locally.</p>
                        <p>The irregular forces are part-time guerrillas. They work by day and
                            conduct operations at night, or they are brought together for a special
                            operation to supplement a regular unit.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Areas of Concentration.</p>

                            once evident that these concentrations are principally in less populated
                            parts of South Vietnam with the notable exception of the two heavy
                            concentrations in the Mekong River delta.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Viet Cong Strategy.</p>
                        <p>At present the Viet Cong forces are in a transitional stage from a
                            guerrilla to a conventional type of warfare. As General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>'s Report<note n="2" xml:id="d42fn2">See <ref target="frus1961-63v01#d210">

                                    Document 210</ref>.</note> noted, the Viet Cong's preferred
                            strategy is one of political denouement,—<pb n="74" xml:id="pg_74" facs="0094"/>preparing for conventional warfare, but hoping for a
                            noncommunist coup against <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>
                            that would create confusion and an opportunity for them to take over the
                            country by political-guerrilla action. The Viet Cong have an offensive
                            capability greater than they have exercised to date, but have proceeded
                            slowly in order to consolidate, regroup, and extend their control
                            throughout the countryside.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">5. Methods of Viet Cong Control.</p>
                        <p>In many areas the Viet Cong have established overt or covert
                            administrations, either setting up permanent, full-time government
                            operations, or exercising a kind of shadow administration, functioning
                            at night while the Government of Vietnam functions by day.</p>
                        <p>We must not assume that the Viet Cong depends solely or even principally
                            on terror. The Viet Cong forces purchase food and other supplies rather
                            than commandeer them. They tax in areas they control and elsewhere raise
                            funds by “squeeze” on bus lines and truck companies operating in or
                            through Viet Cong territory, by robbing government officials and
                            supporters, and by ransom. In the areas south of Saigon, the Viet Cong
                            add to their revenues through considerable export trade by junks with
                            Singapore, principally in tobacco.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">6. Reliance on Local Resources.</p>
                        <p>Much has been made of infiltration from North Vietnam. Except for money,
                            however, very little in the way of weapons or supplies comes in from the
                            North. In fact, the infiltration routes are used almost solely for
                            bringing in trained cadres. These are important, especially to carry out
                            the Viet Cong's phased objective to transform guerrillas into regular
                            forces, but cutting off the infiltration route would not by itself
                            settle the Viet Cong problem. It is the people and villages of South
                            Vietnam that are the Viet Cong's real source of both supplies and
                            recruits. Arms are largely those captured from the Vietnam forces, or
                            are manufactured locally.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">7. Use of Terror.</p>
                        <p>The Viet Cong resort to terror in the areas they control on a far lesser
                            scale than has generally been believed. Instead, they seek to win the
                            cooperation of the villagers, and use terror mainly in retaliation
                            against unpopular government officials or villagers who communicate with
                            or aid the Vietnam forces.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">8. Conclusions.</p>
                        <p>a. The Viet Cong position in South Vietnam depends primarily upon
                            maintaining access to the villages in areas under Viet Cong control or
                            influence.</p>
                        <pb n="75" xml:id="pg_75" facs="0095"/>
                        <p>b. Infiltration of supplies and personnel from North Vietnam is only of
                            secondary importance.</p>
                        <p>c. With their guerrilla tactics based on access to the villages and
                            people, the Viet Cong since the latter part of 1961 have been inflicting
                            roughly 1,000 casualties a month on the Vietnam forces and civilians.
                            There is evidence, however, that the Viet Cong has now entered a
                            transitional stage between guerrilla and conventional methods of warfare
                            in line with the strategy expounded by Mao and Giap.</p>
                        <p>d. The struggle for South Vietnam, in sum, is essentially a battle for
                            control of the villages.</p>
                        <p>e. This struggle cannot be won merely by attempting to seal off South
                            Vietnam from the North. It must be won by cutting the Viet Cong off from
                            their local sources of strength, i.e., by denying them access to the
                            villages and the people.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Strength of Government of Vietnam Forces.</p>
                        <p>The military strength of the Government of Vietnam forces is as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>a. Regular Army—175,000</p>
                        <p>b. Civil Guard—67,000</p>
                        <p>c. Self Defense Corps—54,000</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Proposed Increases.</p>
                        <p>It has been proposed to increase the Regular Army to 200,000. President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>, however, desires a
                            total strength of 278,000. It has also been proposed to increase the
                            Self Defense Corps to 60,000. The present authorized but not actual
                            strength of the Civil Guard is 72,000</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. The Problem of the Regular Army.</p>
                        <p>The most frequent complaint is that the Regular Army is tied down in
                            static defensive positions rather than used as a mobile force which can
                            take offensive. In fact, however, if the Army units were taken off their
                            defense positions, the villages, bridges, and other protected
                            installations would be at the mercy of the Viet Cong, and the economy
                            would grind to a halt. Furthermore, no amount of regular troops used
                            offensively will solve the Viet Cong problem unless the villagers
                            themselves are protected and the Viet Cong thus cut off from their
                            sources of supplies and recruits. If access is not denied, two or more
                            Viet Cong will be recruited for every one that is killed.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Inadequacy of Civil Guard and Self Defense
                            Corps.</p>
                        <p>As recommended in the <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>
                            Report, there should be a drastic increase in the Civil Guard and Self
                            Defense Corps. Steps have been taken in this direction, but more United
                            States help is needed. With a population of 14 million there is only one
                            Civil Guard personnel for every 210 people. Some provinces with a
                            population of over one million have only 2,000 Civil Guards. Again, the
                            Self Defense Corps is maintained at the ratio of only one Self-Defense
                            Corpsman for every 240 people. In addition, the training of both forces
                            is longer than is really needed. These men do not need to have all the
                            skills of the thoroughly trained soldier. What they need to know beyond
                            how to fire their weapons can be acquired in actual operations.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">5. Conclusions.</p>
                        <p>a. The Civil Guard and Self Defense Corps should be very substantially
                            increased to provide protection for the villages—not so much to free the
                            Regular Army units, although this would be a desirable consequence, but
                            to provide the villages with physical security and to cut off Viet Cong
                            access to rice and people.</p>
                        <p>b. The present training period for the Civil Guard is now 24 weeks with a
                            proposed reduction to 12 weeks. The Self Defense Corps is now receiving
                            6 weeks of training at special training centers. Training for both
                            forces should be much shorter. Civil Guard training should be
                            accomplished at the province or, better still, the district level. Self
                            Defense Corps units should be trained in the villages from which they
                            are recruited.</p>
                        <p>c. The technical skills needed for the construction of defenses and the
                            skills for training must be supplied by the United States—by getting
                            American non-commissioned officers and lieutenants out to the district
                            and village level.</p>
                        <p rend="center">III. Political Situation</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. President Diem's Position.</p>
                        <p>a. The people of South Vietnam want to fight and are basically
                            anti-Communist. Morale is much better as a result of General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Maxwell Taylor</persName>'s mission and
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>'s decisions to
                            support South Vietnam. But this boost will be fleeting if we do not find
                            ways to continue the momentum.</p>
                        <p>b. As General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> reported,
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> is an
                            old-fashioned Asian ruler who hesitates to delegate authority.
                            Nevertheless, he does have the respect of his people. With due allowance
                            for his shortcomings, it must be recognized that he is faced with real
                            problems. His country is partly occupied and controlled by enemy forces
                            which have <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0097"/>a demonstrated
                            capability of increasing the magnitude of their operations against his
                            government. The very existence of his country is thus at stake.</p>
                        <p>c. Because of the adverse military situation, <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> is also faced with the real possibility of coup
                            attempts by elements within South Vietnam. He is convinced that the Viet
                            Cong are hoping most of all for a coup which will give the opportunity
                            for them to move in. <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> also
                            occasionally has doubts about the Americans on this score. Although he
                            seems to be convinced that present United States policy is to support
                            him, he is concerned that the United States will someday decide to
                            engineer a coup if he lets American influence in South Vietnam become
                            too great.</p>
                        <p>d. Finally, <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> does lack trained
                            personnel, particularly at the lower levels. As General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> noted, there is no lack of
                            dedication, but there is a great shortage of competence.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. The United States Missions in South
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>a. Some United States personnel in all agencies have been in Vietnam too
                            long and carry old grudges and frustrations, or are unduly influenced by
                            the views of various South Vietnamese “dissidents.” These frustrated
                            old-timers feed defeatist talk to the American press. They also talk to
                            and encourage the “dissidents” among the French-educated South
                            Vietnamese intellectuals who are concentrated in Saigon.</p>
                        <p>b. What is worse, some of these so-called “dissidents” actually are
                            stalking horses for <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> who take
                            criticism of <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> back to him,
                            and thus complete the vicious circle of suspicion of the United States,
                            frustration, and defeatism.</p>
                        <p>c. Moreover, the United States Missions in South Vietnam do not always
                            work as a team. Each agency has its own views and concepts which have
                            led to inter-agency jealousies and bickering. In all United States
                            agencies, furthermore, much could be done to improve the quality of
                            personnel.</p>
                        <p>d. While the top United States leadership is rapidly developing knowledge
                            of the strategic concepts for fighting guerrillas, there is as yet no
                            real understanding of these concepts at the working level. The problem
                            here is one of leadership and articulation.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Conclusions.</p>
                        <p>a. Some easing of United States pressure on <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> for major reforms and reorganization of his
                            government at the top seems called for. Although desirable, none of
                            these are fundamental to the problem of cutting the Viet Cong's access
                            to the villages and the people.</p>
                        <pb n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0098"/>
                        <p>b. We should turn our attention to providing help at the local level.
                            What we need are sergeants, lieutenants, and Civic Action teams,
                            including police trainers and public administrators, to work with the
                            Vietnamese Government officials in the villages and with the troops in
                            the field.</p>
                        <p>c. As recommended in the <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> Report, in sum, we need more “working level
                            friends and advisers”—Americans with technical competence, imagination,
                            and human sympathy, and with the willingness and ability to live and
                            work in the villages. As General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> said, such personnel exist and can be found and
                            trained for the job.</p>
                        <p>d. Finally, there is an immediate need to develop a better understanding
                            of the strategic concept for counterinsurgency war among working level
                            Americans in all United States agencies in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p rend="center">IV. The Strategic Concept</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Basic Principles.</p>
                        <p>The strategic concept of an effective counterinsurgency operation in
                            South Vietnam is expressed in the following principles:</p>
                        <p>a. <hi rend="italic">First Principle. The problem presented by the Viet
                                Cong is a political and not a military problem—or, more accurately,
                                it is a problem in civic action.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The objective is to cut the Viet Cong off from their sources of supplies
                            and recruits. Since both supplies and recruits come from within South
                            Vietnam, this means cutting off the Viet Cong's access to the villages
                            and the people.</p>
                        <p>Measures must be taken to tie the villages into the network of government
                            administration and control. Channels must be established through which
                            information of the villages' needs and problems can flow upward and
                            government services can flow downward. The instruments for this task are
                            public administration officials, police, public information services,
                            etc.</p>
                        <p>b. <hi rend="italic">Second Principle. An effective counterinsurgency
                                plan must provide the people and the villages with protection and
                                physical security.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Physical security, coupled with controls on the movement of people and
                            supplies, will protect the villagers from being intimidated into selling
                            the Viet Cong rice and from being persuaded or intimidated into joining
                            the Viet Cong, and will prevent Viet Cong sympathizers from
                            surreptitiously providing the guerrillas with supplies.</p>
                        <p>In addition, it is only by giving the people physical security that the
                            intelligence problem can be solved. The intelligence problem in Vietnam
                            is one of combat intelligence, not strategic intelligence. Espionage
                            penetration of the Viet Cong will take too long to accomplish. And even
                            then the results will not be satisfactory. For example, an agent in a
                            Viet Cong unit will have a difficult problem in communicating. By the
                            time he can get intelligence to the government on an <pb n="79" xml:id="pg_79" facs="0099"/>impending attack, for example, the
                            attack will probably have already taken place; by the time he can pass
                            on information on the location of a Viet Cong unit he is with, the unit
                            will have probably moved on.</p>
                        <p>c. <hi rend="italic">Third Principle: Counter-guerrilla forces must adopt
                                the tactics of the guerrilla himself. Conventional military tactics
                                are ineffective against guerrillas.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Example: Past and Present.</p>
                        <p>The Third Principle merits elaboration by specific examples. Two have
                            been chosen: the first from operations in Burma during World War II, and
                            the second from the very recent operations in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">a. The Heho-Lawksawk-Taunggyi Operation,
                            Burma.</p>
                        <p>In the Battle of Mandalay-Meiktila, an OSS group consisting of 4
                            Americans and 300 natives operated in the mountains along the Japanese
                            secondary supply line, Meiktila-Taunggyi-Bangkok' in the
                            Heho-Lawksawk-Taunggyi triangle (see Map 2). The DSS guerrilla force
                            blew bridges to restrict the movement of Japanese artillery and ambushed
                            Japanese truck convoys. Although the Japanese forces could ill afford
                            it, a Japanese regiment of 3,000 men was taken out of the battle for one
                            month to pursue the OSS guerrilla group.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese method of operation, however, was conventional—they pursued
                            with regiments and battalions along the major roads and attempted
                            elaborate, set-piece traps. For example, when the guerrilla group was
                            operating in the area just north of Taunggyi, the Japanese moved several
                            battalions into a U-shaped position on the road feeding to Lawksawk and
                            attempted to chivvy the OSS guerrilla group into the trap with the
                            remaining battalion. Although the OSS group could easily have escaped by
                            breaking into groups of two or three and assembling again at a later
                            date, even this proved unnecessary. The OSS group marched north to
                            encourage the Japanese to complete the execution of their plan and, at
                            nightfall, turned west into the jungle and made their way into the
                            mountains. The Japanese closed the trap on air.</p>
                        <p>At the end of one month the Japanese had suffered something over 100
                            casualties, and the OSS group had suffered one.</p>
                        <p>Had the Japanese adopted a different tactic, however, the guerrilla group
                            would not have survived. What the Japanese should have done was to
                            combine their greater mobility and discipline with guerrilla tactics.
                            For example, they could have stationed half of their force at one of the
                            major road junctions with trucks to provide rapid deployment so far as
                            the road-net would permit. Then they could have divided the area in
                            which the OSS guerrillas were operating into zones, and stationed a
                            platoon or company in each of the zones with orders to operate as the
                            guerrillas were operating, i.e., to patrol and ambush on all jungle
                            trails and paths. Sooner or later one of these units would have met the
                            OSS guerrillas. The mobile reserve could then have been deployed in
                            order to ambush along the trails leading into the area and to reinforce
                            troops engaged in combat. It is worth noting that once the OSS group
                            were eliminated as an organized force by some such tactic, the Japanese
                            should then have placed an effective <pb n="80" xml:id="pg_80" facs="0100"/>administration over the area and its villages in order
                            to prevent remnants of the OSS guerrilla force from returning as soon as
                            the regular forces departed.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">b. The Binh Hoa Operation, South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>On January 21, 1962 a joint South Vietnamese-United States attack was
                            undertaken against the Viet Cong at Binh Hoa (see Map 3). According to
                            intelligence reports, there were 300 Viet Cone at Point A and a full
                            Viet Cong battalion in huts around the edges of the Air Drop Zone. These
                            reports were 4 or 5 days old, but air photos showed what appeared to be
                            a munitions manufacturing installation at Point B and possibly munitions
                            storage facilities at Point C.</p>
                        <p>The plan, prepared by the senior United States Military Advisor to the
                            Vietnamese Army 3rd Corps, called for prepositioning four battalions in
                            boats on the nver during the night before the operation.</p>
                        <p>At 0755 hours, B-26's bombed and strafed Point A. (The terrain here
                            consists of flat jungle. The bombers actually attacked a village just on
                            the Cambodian side of the frontier, one and a half kilometers away, and
                            killed and wounded a number of villagers.)</p>
                        <p>At 0800 hours, B-26's attacked Point B and C with 500-pound bombs, while
                            T-28's attacked the huts surrounding the Air Drop Zone with rockets.
                            When the first bomb exploded, the four battalions on boats disembarked.
                            The bombing and strafing continued for 45 minutes. There was then a
                            15-minute lull, the beginning of which was marked by the firing of
                            flares in front of each of the four battalions, which then began their
                            advance.</p>
                        <p>The two battalions south of the canal between Points B and C wheeled
                            right into a blocking position along the canal, and the two battalions
                            north of the canal advanced directly to their front. At-00 hours, an
                            airborne battalion parachuted on the Air Drop Zone and attacked in the
                            direction of Point B. In Phase II of the operation, all troops conducted
                            a sweep north of the Oriental River.</p>
                        <p>The plan was well and efficiently executed. It was, however,
                            inappropriate in counterguerrilla warfare. The basic concept of creating
                            a trap will rarely work against guerrillas. In general, counterguerrilla
                            warfare requires that contact be made with the guerrillas by aggressive
                            patrolling, and at that point troops should be brought up to form a trap
                            by ambushing the trails and roads leading away from the area of
                            contact.</p>
                        <p>The prepositioning of troops in boats was very likely to give the
                            guerrillas prior warning of an attack.</p>
                        <p>The preparatory bombing also gave the guerrillas warning. In addition, it
                            ran the risk of hlling innocent or at least persuadable villagers and
                            thus recruiting more Communists than were killed. Preparatory bombing is
                            suitable for attacks on prepared defenses in conventional war, but not
                            for guerrilla war. There are no Siegfried lines in the jungle.</p>
                        <p>The results of the Binh Hoa operation confirm this analysis. According to
                            after-action reports, no contact with the enemy was made in Phase I of
                            the operation. However, five civilians were killed and eleven wounded.
                            (Reports are unclear as to whether these casualties did or did not
                            include the Cambodians killed in the misdirected strike at Point A.)
                            According to Mr. Socharyk of <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> Magazine, who
                            followed <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0101"/>the airdrop by
                            helicopter, those killed in action included a two-year old boy, a
                            five-year old girl, and a seven-year old boy. Mr. Socharyk also
                            maintains that he can document his statements with photographs.</p>
                        <p>In Phase II of the operation—the sweep north of Oriental River—the Viet
                            Cong lost 5 killed, 21 captured, and 60 suspects apprehended. Weapons
                            and documents of intelligence value were captured. South Vietnamese
                            casualties were six wounded.</p>
                        <p>It seems obvious that such an operation is not only fruitless but creates
                            more Communists than it kills. Let it also be said, however that General
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName>, Chief of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, took strong and positive action to
                            correct the misconceptions apparent in this operation, and spoke to the
                            military personnel involved in strong and unmistakable language.</p>
                        <p>In fairness, however, it must also be said that this is by no means an
                            isolated occurrence. As a perusal of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>'s military situation reports will show, operations by
                            both Jungle Jim and military forces tend to follow tactics more
                            appropriate to conventional, World War II situations than to guerrilla
                            warfare.</p>
                        <p>Also in fairness, it should be noted that counterguerrilla operations are
                            both new and radically different from American military experience,
                            requiring soldiers to unlearn old lessons as well as to learn new ones.
                            It would be unfair and unreasonable to expect men to abandon overnight
                            principles learned the hard way in bloody and honorable combat in World
                            War II and Korea. The fact that this is precisely what is needed in no
                            way condemns the soldiers or excuses those who would criticize them.</p>
                        <p>As it turned out, the intelligence reports were essentially accurate.
                            Local Vietnamese reported that one hour before the air strike an
                            estimated 200 Viet Cong evacuated the Air Drop Zone.</p>
                        <p>The question is, how should the Binh Hoa operation have been conducted to
                            take advantage of this intelligence?</p>
                        <p>In general, counterguerrilla operations should be so conducted as to make
                            contact with the enemy through ground patrols before air strikes are
                            mounted.</p>
                        <p>The intelligence about Viet Cong activities in Binh Hoa was on the whole
                            good. The utilization of this intelligence was ineffective. The
                            operation gave the Viet Cong ample warning and they apparently took full
                            advantage of it.</p>
                        <p>The rationale for the preliminary air strike was human and
                            understandable: paratroopers in the air are vulnerable, and an air
                            strike will tend to protect them. Nevertheless, a preliminary air strike
                            in counterguerrilla operations is indefensible.</p>
                        <p>The rationale for the use of paratroopers is less understandable. The
                            rationale was that since intelligence reported a full battalion of Viet
                            Cong, a full battalion of <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> was
                            needed. The helicopters available, however, could deliver only half of a
                            battalion in the first wave. Thus, an air drop seemed to be
                            indicated.</p>
                        <p>These arguments seem reasonable, but they are inappropriate to
                            counterguerrilla warfare. In counterguerrilla warfare it is essential to
                            distinguish between hard-core guerrillas and ordinary villagers, even
                            though the latter may be sympathetic to the guerrillas. Contact must be
                            made with the enemy before the air strike, not after, and surprise is
                            all-important since guerrillas do not seek to hold ground but to
                            influence and control the minds and hearts of the people.</p>
                        <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0102"/>
                        <p>A preliminary air strike is therefore inadmissible in counterguerrilla
                            operations. In addition, paratroopers are useful not as the attacking
                            but only as the reinforcing element—after contact is made by patrols or
                            other means, e.g., helicopters. It takes three to five minutes for a
                            paratroop unit to reach the ground, and three to five minutes is time
                            enough for a guerrilla unit to escape to the jungle.</p>
                        <p>In general, the first contact must be made by units that operate in the
                            same way as the guerrillas themselves—living for lone periods in the
                            jungle, patrolling, ambushing, moving, and never sleeping two nights in
                            the same place.</p>
                        <p>The one exception to this rule is a force moved by helicopter. Flying
                            three to five feet off the ground along roadways and canals, a
                            helicopter discharges its troops only 12 seconds after the enemy sees
                            and identifies it. The Binh Hoa operation might well have utilized
                            helicopters. The helicopters available could have transported only half
                            a battalion in the first wave. But these could have made contact with
                            the enemy with no warning whatsoever.</p>
                        <p>Once contact was made, the Jungle Jim unit could have been called in with
                            effect—against a known and precisely located enemy. The paratroopers,
                            orbiting at a higher altitude, could then have been introduced either to
                            reinforce the helicopter unit already engaged or to block the routes of
                            Viet Cong retreat.</p>
                        <p>If the intelligence was faulty, no harm would have been done with such
                            tactics and no villagers would have been killed. If the intelligence had
                            been correct, however, these tactics would have prevented a warning to
                            the Viet Cong. Their retreat would have been slowed up by the fire of
                            the hoops brought in by helicopter, impeded by the strikes of the Jungle
                            Jim unit, and blocked by the action of the paratroopers.</p>

                                followed in this plan was developed by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">R.G.K. Thompson</persName>, who played a
                                major role in directing counter-insurgency operations in Malaya and

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. General Concept.</p>
                        <p>The following plan consists of three phases, each of which involves a
                            combination of military, political, civic action, economic, and social
                            measures.</p>
                        <p>This plan is designed to eliminate the Viet Cong from successive areas
                            through a progression of steps, and to provide the villages with a
                            security framework and a solid socio-political base to ensure that this
                            elimination is permanent.</p>
                        <p>The people of South Vietnam are the target, and the vast majority of the
                            people live in the Mekong River delta and along the coasts (see Map 4).
                            The first priority should therefore be the delta area and, for obvious
                            international political reasons, the area around Hue, just south of the
                            Demarcation Line.</p>
                        <pb n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0103"/>
                        <p>Phase I provides the security framework and socio-political base for
                            these two first-priority areas; Phase II covers the other areas of heavy
                            population density; and Phase III is designed to provide permanent
                            protection at the borders and to eliminate the remaining Viet Cong in
                            the mountains and jungles of the less populated regions.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Phase I.</p>
                        <p>Zones of strategic villages will be established simultaneously in the two
                            first-priority areas, beginning with provinces least heavily penetrated
                            by the Viet Cong. As each zone is completed, work will begin on
                            additional zones, fanning outwards until the entire province is covered,
                            and eventually, at the end of Phase I, the whole of the two
                            first-priority areas.</p>
                        <p>Take, for example, the province of Binh Tuong (see Map 5). Let us assume
                            for purposes of illustration that the white area east of zones I and II
                            is virtually free of Viet Cong, that zone I is moderately penetrated,
                            and that zone II is virtually free but subject to incursions by Viet
                            Cong irregulars from the south. In the white area, strategic villages
                            would not be necessary. Zone I would need strategic villages to protect
                            its population from local Viet Cong, and zone II would need them to
                            protect its population from incursions from the heavily penetrated area
                            of the south. After zones I and II have been secured, the teams would
                            move on to zone III.</p>
                        <p>At the same time as these zones of strategic villages are being
                            constructed work would begin on a belt of <hi rend="italic">defended</hi> villages in zone IV along the edge of the population
                            density line to serve as a cordon sanitaire.</p>
                        <p>The regular forces of the South Vietnamese army would at the same time
                            wage a sustained campaign of patrolling and appropriately conceived
                            offensives against the regular Viet Cong forces with whatever troops it
                            has available after discharging the essential tasks of defending vital
                            installations and protecting the teams constructing strategic villages.
                            Keeping the regular Viet Cong off balance is vital, since the Communists
                            will make every effort to prevent the construction of strategic village
                            zones.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">a. Strategic Villages.</p>
                        <p>The creation of strategic villages in relatively secure areas involves
                            the regroupment of village hamlets into one compact, easily defended
                            area. The difficulties of this regroupment will vary with the village,
                            depending on its size, population, and distribution of its hamlets.</p>
                        <p>Each strategic village will be protected by a ditch and a fence of barbed
                            wire. It will include one or more observation towers, guard posts, and a
                            defense post for central storage of arms, as shown in the attached
                            diagram (see Sketch). The area immediately around the village <pb n="84" xml:id="pg_84" facs="0104"/>will be cleared for fields of fire and
                            the area approaching the clearing, including the ditch, will be strewn
                            with booby-traps (spikes, pits, explosives, etc.) and other personnel
                            obstacles. In these tasks, the help of United States Army sergeants and
                            lieutenants as advisors will be vital.</p>
                        <p>Each strategic village will have field telephones and an alarm system
                            connecting the watch towers and guard posts with the defense posts, as
                            well as radio facilities enabling it to maintain direct communication
                            with the government administrative and the military-security command
                            structure at the district level, and ultimately up to the central
                            government complex in Saigon. Here, too, the help of American advisors
                            will be necessary.</p>
                        <p>Each strategic village will be defended by a Self Defense Corps unit of
                            75 to 150 men, i.e., 1 squad per hamlet and 1 platoon per village. Each
                            Self Defense Corps unit will be armed with carbines, 45 caliber grease
                            guns and shotguns, and its arms and ammunition will be centrally located
                            and guarded.</p>
                        <p>The primary missions of the Self Defense Corps unit are to defend the
                            strategic village from attack and to conduct daylight patrols outside
                            the immediate vicinity of the strategic village.</p>
                        <p>The areas between strategic villages will be covered by the Civil Guard.
                            The Civil Guard will conduct night patrols between the strategic
                            villages' lay ambushes, assist in guarding strategic government
                            installations, maintain road check points, and constitute a mobile
                            reserve, i.e., to relieve a strategic village when under attack or
                            assist the Army in larger operations against the Viet Cong. Here, too,
                            the help of American sergeants and lieutenants is vital.</p>
                        <p>The Civil Guard and the Self Defense Corps (along with the National
                            Surete and the Municipal Police, the regular police services in urban
                            areas) will also be responsible for enforcing curfews, checking identity
                            cards, and ferreting out hard-core Communists and provide intelligence
                            on the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>In this respect, it cannot be stressed too strongly that the key to
                            effective intelligence is not penetration of the Viet Cong apparatus (it
                            would be too difficult and take too long to achieve this capability) but
                            rather the mere fact of providing security to the villager from Viet
                            Cong intimidation and terror. This security for him and his family will
                            motivate the villagers to pass on information on the Viet Cong to
                            government officials. The US Central Intelligence Agency should give
                            high priority to the installation of road watchers as utilized in Laos.
                            This is not to say that there is no room for clandestine intelligence
                            operations. however</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">b. Defended Villages.</p>
                        <p>The creation of defended villages will follow essentially the pattern for
                            strategic villages, i.e., regroupment of hamlets, construction of
                            defenses, alarm systems, communications, etc.</p>
                        <p>Defended villages, however, would be created along the periphery of Viet
                            Cong concentration areas in such a fashion to form a belt of defended
                            villages along a population density line covering roughly one-half of
                            the Mekong River delta area and then swinging eastward toward the coast
                            and running north along the coast to just south of Tourane, and then
                            westward to the Lao frontier.</p>
                        <p>Another major difference between the strategic and the defended village
                            is that the latter is defended both by the Self Defense Corps and the
                            Civil Guard units and initially, at least, by Army units.</p>
                        <p>The defended village belt thus constitutes the forward security line
                            against further Viet Cong expansion. The strategic villages constitute
                            rear echelon sectors where mopping up and consolidation take place. The
                            number of both the defended and the strategic villages would be expanded
                            progressively to squeeze and isolate the Viet Cong and increase secured
                            areas.</p>
                        <p>Once zones of strategic villages with the Civil Guard operating in the
                            intermediate areas are established, the Viet Cong will be effectively
                            cut off from the sources of both supplies and recruits. If a Viet Cong
                            unit ventures into such a zone, it will find itself in what is, in fact,
                            a meat grinder.</p>
                        <p>Sooner or later, the intruding Viet Cong unit will run into a Civil Guard
                            ambush or patrol. This, in turn, will be followed by reinforcements by
                            other Civil Guard and even regular Army units, called in by radio and
                            transported by helicopter, and by ambushes on trails and roads leading
                            to the area of contact. In addition, the controls on the movements of
                            people and supplies will force an intruding Viet Cong unit to attack
                            strategic villages to obtain food. And such an attack will, in turn,
                            bring still more reinforcements and ambushes on the routes of escape.
                            The Viet Cong, in sum, will be forced to attack and the advantage of
                            ambush will pass from the Communists to the government.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">c. Role of the Army.</p>
                        <p>In carrying out its primary mission of keeping the regular Viet Cong
                            forces off balance, it is essential that the Army adopt the strategy and
                            tactics used by the Viet Cong, exploiting at the same time the Army's
                            advantages of numerical superiority, logistics, and air power.</p>
                        <p>Mobility, surprise, and small unit operations are basic. The deployment
                            of forces, however secure and well coordinated, along conventional
                            warfare lines and the use of artillery or aerial bombardment for
                            softening up the enemy only give advance warning of an operation, <pb n="86" xml:id="pg_86" facs="0106"/>permit the Viet Cong to escape,
                            and inevitably result in the death of uncommitted or wavering civilians
                            whose support is essential for the Viet Cong's ultimate defeat.
                            Artillery or aerial bombardment, therefore, should be introduced only
                            after actual ground contact with Viet Cong forces has been made.</p>
                        <p>The Army should also be utilized to reduce infiltration across the
                            frontier. Ranger companies are best equipped to execute this mission.
                            They should be committed to specified zones along the frontier area (see
                            Map 4), particularly in the highlands along the Lao border, for periods
                            of three to four months, at least. They should be highly mobile, never
                            sleeping twice in the same place, and patrolling and ambushing at will.
                            Here, again, US Army advisors are needed to assist and to set an
                            example.</p>
                        <p>Ranger companies contacting large Viet Cong units would be supported by
                            air drops and paratroop reinforcement.</p>
                        <p>To sum up, the role of the Army in Phase I is as follows:</p>
                        <p>To continue to defend vital installations, province capitals, and other
                            strategic points until relieved by the creation of local zones of
                            strategic villages.</p>
                        <p>To provide protection for the teams constructing strategic villages m the
                            more dangerous areas.</p>
                        <p>To use the remaining forces offensively against the regular Viet Cong
                            units to keep them off balance.</p>
                        <p>To operate themselves as guerrillas along the Viet Cong infiltration
                            routes.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">d. Civic Action Teams.</p>
                        <p>The single most important element in eliminating the Viet Cong is the
                            so-called Civic Action Team. These teams were apparently originated on
                            the initiative of the South Vietnamese. Each team is made up of 17-18
                            persons with the following specialties:</p>
                        <p>3 public administration</p>
                        <p>1 youth activities</p>
                        <p>2-3 police training</p>
                        <p>1 public information</p>
                        <p>1 agricultural credit</p>
                        <p>1 medical</p>
                        <p>1 education</p>
                        <p>1 intelligence</p>
                        <p>1 Civil Guard liaison</p>
                        <p>5 Self Defense Corps training</p>
                        <p>In this plan the task of the civic action teams is to assist locals in
                            the construction of strategic villages and to build the essenha1
                            socio-political base.</p>
                        <pb n="87" xml:id="pg_87" facs="0107"/>
                        <p>The public administration members will set up village government and tie
                            it into the district and national levels assuring the flow of
                            information on village needs and problems upward and the flow of
                            government services downward.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> has himself
                            organized a youth movement of 300,000 members. The youth activities man
                            on the civic action team would relate the youth in the village to the
                            national government through this organization and use its members as
                            recruits for the Self Defense Corps and other necessary tasks.</p>
                        <p>The 2-3 police members of the team perform the essential task of issuing
                            identity cards, instituting controls on the movements of supplies, food
                            and people, and so filtering out the hard-core Communists within the
                            local population.</p>
                        <p>The public information member of the team has the task of explaining the
                            need for relocating hamlets, the construction of strategic villages, as
                            well as bringing political support to the national government.</p>
                        <p>The agricultural credit member of the team will assist in solving the
                            problems connected with the relocation of hamlets as well as
                            agricultural credit programs.</p>
                        <p>The medical technician will look to health and sanitation problems.</p>
                        <p>The educational specialist will deal with and assist in the
                            reconstruction of schools and school programs.</p>
                        <p>The intelligence specialist will serve as liaison for channeling
                            information obtained from the villages to district, province, and
                            national levels.</p>
                        <p>The Civil Guard liaison official will man the radio used for calling
                            forth support of nearby Civil Guard units in case of attack.</p>
                        <p>The Self Defense Corps trainers will recruit and train Self Defense Corps
                            personnel in the village.</p>
                        <p>There are now only some 30-40 civic action teams operating throughout
                            South Vietnam. Two hundred are needed. In addition, each team should
                            also include a United States Army sergeant or lieutenant to help in Self
                            Defense Corps training and if possible an American civilian with public
                            administration or police training.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Phase II.</p>
                        <p>In Phase II the same methods would be used to extend the zones of
                            strategic villages to cover the remaining densely populated areas.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Phase II will also include a stepped-up program of economic and
                            social development. These measures should be designed to achieve maximum
                            effect at the village level and to build up the progress made by the
                            Civic Action teams during Phase I.</p>
                        <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0108"/>
                        <p>Finally, during Phase II increased attention would be given to the
                            security of the tribesmen in the Montagnard highlands (where it is
                            difficult to apply the strategic village concept because villages are
                            too far apart). For example, rice would be purchased and stored at
                            protected sites and then sold once a week at about half the price to the
                            tribal peoples on a closely controlled ration basis to deny it to the
                            Viet Cong.</p>

                        <p>Suitably hardy, loyal and tough villagers will be resettled in

                            borders. (The cost here is higher, since it requires clearing new lands
                            and possibly permanent subsidies in the form of wages for duty by adult
                            males as border guards.)</p>
                        <p>Continuing its offensive, the regular army will pursue and destroy the
                            remnants of the Viet Cong hiding in the under-populated mountains and
                            jungles.</p>
                        <p>Special economic, social, and political measures will be undertaken to

                        <p>1. Official <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> request has been received
                            from Secretary Thuan for commencement crop warfare program. In his
                            request, <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> stated
                            instructions are being given to <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>
                            to avoid damage to crops belonging to government supporters and to take
                            such preventive measures as may be required to avoid adverse political
                            or psychological reaction. Action now being taken to determine if
                            instructions meet requirements ref msg for resettlement displaced
                            persons and alternated <pb n="91" xml:id="pg_91" facs="0111"/>food
                            supply system. VN Chairman, Joint Planning Committee for Defoliation and
                            Crop Warfare, had previously been made aware of US position as stated in
                            ref msg and is currently trying to ensure that instructions from DOD
                            include appropriate provisions to meet requirement although in the past
                            Vietnamese have been generally cool to idea of specific plans for
                            resettlement and alternate food supply. VN position, not officially
                            expressed, has stemmed from following arguments:</p>
                        <p>A. Crop warfare is primarily a <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> show.
                            All missions to be flown by VNAF personnel in VNAF helicopters against
                            targets selected by Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p>B. <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> is currently engaged in a crop
                            warfare program. In their reparations in the field, <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> crops and food caches are destroyed
                            whenever found. Chemicals, therefore, are regarded as just another and
                            more effective means of doing something <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> is already doing.</p>
                        <p>C. Chemicals will only be employed in areas not under <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> control and where population either
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> supporters. Food supply has been a major concern of the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. Denial of food would drive <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and their supporters out of their safe
                            haven at last. They would then be handled as the individual situation
                            dictated. The ideal being to resettle and reorient all except hard-core
                            Communists.</p>
                        <p>2. After considerable US pressure to get defoliation program going, there
                            are some indications that Vietnamese are now becoming impatient with US
                            restrictions imposed on employment of chemicals. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> has always actively supported crop
                            warfare program. Now that chemicals are here, VNAF helicopters equipped
                            and target areas selected, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> anxious
                            to start.</p>
                        <p>3. There is always the possibility, no matter how great the precautions,
                            that spray operations may produce an adverse effect among people who
                            would support the government under more favorable circumstances. A
                            similar risk is involved when conventional weapons are employed to
                            reduce an area regarded as a <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            stronghold. Even though we may [?] in having the Vietnamese develop a
                            plan on paper that is considered satisfactory and meets the requirements
                            of ref msg, we have no assurance that the provisions of the plans will
                            be faithfully excused. once chemicals are released to the VN, it will be
                            virtually impossible to determine if those targets scheduled to be hit
                            are the ones that are actually sprayed. US can participate in planning
                            for crop warfare but US participation in its execution has already been
                            ruled out.</p>
                        <p>4. American Embassy has decided to take another hard look at crop warfare
                            program to see if political disadvantages outweigh military advantages.
                            They are currently in process of drafting a Task Force message on this
                            subject to be coordinated in the near future. Above information
                            submitted as background in the event Embassy now takes a position
                            against any crop warfare. At such time as draft of Task Force <pb n="92" xml:id="pg_92" facs="0112"/>msg received, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> will make specific comments and recommendations. At
                            present time feel there are military advantages to be gained in crop
                            warfare and that a complete reversal of US position would be hard to
                            justify to Diem.</p>

                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>'s initial reaction is that

                        <p>040531Z. Use of offensive air power.</p>
                        <p>1. Undesirable reactions that grow out of the indiscriminate use of the
                            air arm in counter guerrilla operations has been thoroughly belabored in
                            all reports on the Greek anti-bandit war and the Indochina episode. At
                            one time during earlier part of Indochina war there were two opposing
                            views on exercising tight restraint on use of aircraft against ground
                            targets. One view was usual one of not alienating friendly peoples by
                            making them victims of unjustifiable air attacks. The other view (an
                            extension of a common Foreign Legion attitude) was that anti-guerrilla
                            forces should not hamper their operations by too much purposeful
                            restraint, particularly considering there were certain advantages to be
                            gained from bringing populace to realize that innocent and guilty alike
                            would suffer when Vietminh were detected in their midst. Idea here of
                            course being that all non-communist Indochinese would realize that very
                            presence of Vietminh was a “plague on their houses” and therefore they
                            should specifically direct anti guerrilla forces to the Vietminh unless
                            they wanted to suffer along with communists. French officers in
                            non-Foreign Legion outfits contended <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97" facs="0117"/>such policy was typical of the “boche” influence in the
                            Foreign Legion. In the end, more temperate policies for using air power
                            prevailed—although many tragic errors in target designation continued to
                            be made until end of war.</p>
                        <p>2. In both Greece and Indochina it was found that normal problems of
                            target location and identification were compounded by fact that friend
                            and foe were intermingled. It was found that only positive system of
                            enemy target location was by ground forces who enjoy facility of
                            positive identification through factor of their being shot at. It was
                            also found, however, that potential for making maximum employment of
                            available air power was considerably curtailed by waiting for footsore
                            troops to run down and fix, in substantial lumps, a will-o-the-wisp
                            guerrilla enemy. Problem was finally handled in both wars by attempting
                            to develop an effective air/ground communication capability for close
                            air support; and as far as independent air attacks were concerned, being
                            as careful as possible when shooting up things around friendly
                            areas.</p>
                        <p>3. We have been impressed with the expressed concern of several <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> officers that innocent people might
                            suffer from the use of defoliants, mines, etc. They seemed to be well
                            oriented on the undesirable aspects of the indiscriminate use of weapons
                            amongst the civilian populace. Recognizing <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> awareness in this direction, I feel we should be
                            confident that all concerned in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> are
                            applying the element of good judgment in the use of air power. I believe
                            we should also recognize that occasional mistakes will be made as they
                            were many times in WW II and Korea, and they should not be justification
                            for imposing unreasonable restrictions on the use of the VNAF. This may
                            well be a subject for discussion at next SecDef mtg at my hdqtrs.</p>

                        <p>1013. We are running into increasing difficulties here with US newsmen.
                            They claim they not being given sufficient opportunity to cover US

                            of the two phase plan was to destroy the Viet Cong, their bases and
                            installations in an area as shown on the inclosed map.<note n="3" xml:id="d49fn3">Not printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Phase I called for airstrikes on D-day, 21 January 1962, followed by a
                            parachute assault by the 5th Airborne Battalion to seize objectives in
                            the drop zone. During Phase 1, the 1st and 3rd Battalions (8th Regiment)
                            and the 2nd and 3rd Battalions (11th Regiment) were to cross the Vaico
                            River from east to west to attack and occupy IA and other objectives in
                            the operations area.</p>
                        <p>During Phase II, the 5th Airborne Battalion was to move from its previous
                            objective in the drop zone to Cu Chi via Saigon for deception purposes
                            and to establish blocking and ambush positions. In the meantime, the 1st
                            and 3rd Battalions were to move from their original objective and seize
                            new objective IIA, while the 2nd and 3rd Battalions were to seize new
                            objective IIB.</p>

                        <p>In effect, the Viet Cong would then be caught between the 5th Airborne
                            Battalion in the vicinity of Cu Chi, and four Battalions of the 8th and
                            11th Regiments closing in from the west on objectives IIA and IIB.</p>
                        <p>Aerial observation by L-19 and fighter aircraft was to be continuous. The
                            57th (US) Transport Company was to provide an aerial Command Post,
                            medical evacuation, parachute recovery and on call reserve lift.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Composition of Friendly Forces</hi>. Ground Forces
                            consisted of elements of the 8th Regiment, 5th Division; and the 11th
                            Regiment, 7th Division. River forces consisted of eight special purpose
                            craft. Air forces consisted of 11 Farm Gate aircraft, 10 aircraft of the
                            VNAF and one U.S. light helicopter company.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Composition of Enemy Forces.</hi> Enemy forces
                            consisted of various enemy units with an approximate total strength of
                            750 men.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">After Action Report.</hi> The airstrikes were executed
                            as planned on D-day (210 755H). During Phase I, the 5th Airborne
                            Battalion jumped from VNAF C-47's and secured its objective. Four
                            soldiers were killed and many documents captured. Patrolling continued
                            throughout the day. Phase I Battalions of the 8th and 11th Regiments
                            crossed the Vaico River as planned, attacked and seized their
                            objectives. All units continued search operations through D+2. Phase II
                            units continued the attack on 22 January and elements of the 8th and
                            11th Regiments seized their new objectives. During Phase II the 5th
                            Airborne Battalion was re-deployed and used as blocking and ambush
                            forces in the vicinity of Cu Chi. Operations concluded on D+4. No supply
                            or maintenance problems were encountered. Evacuation of casualties was
                            timely. Lack of external antenna for ground radios created some
                            communications problems.</p>
                        <p>Planning was detailed and US advisors participated throughout.
                            Intelligence during the planning phase was detailed, accurate and up to
                            date.</p>
                        <p>Study of <gloss target="#t_CHMAAG1">CHMAAG</gloss>'s report of the entire
                            operation indicates that the plan did not make adequate use of the
                            element of surprise. Troop movements prior to the attack alarmed the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and the heavy air activity caused
                            a <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> alert and evacuation. Had troop
                            movements been carried out gradually over the period of a few days prior
                            to the attack and with some deceptive moves included, <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> suspicions may not have been aroused.
                            Aerial reconnaissance and the airstrikes appear too prolonged and
                            without an attempt at deceptive strikes in areas outside the actual
                            objective zones.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Results</hi>. While the execution of the ground
                            operation was considered excellent, and the airstrike and airborne
                            operation was carried out as planned, the results were disappointing.
                            The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> in the area had <pb n="101" xml:id="pg_101" facs="0121"/>evacuated prior to the attacks and the
                            number killed and/or captured was negligible. Enemy casualties consisted
                            of five killed, 15 captured, and 64 suspects held for interrogation.</p>

                            an airstrike in nearby Cambodian territory due to faulty target
                            identification was reported. The intended target area is shown on the
                            attacked map, as well as the small village of Bathu on which the attack
                            was actually made.</p>
                        <p>Foreign correspondents, <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>
                            representatives, the U.S. Army Attaché, Cambodia and <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> officials were flown to the scene on 22
                            January 1962. Ground reconnaissance showed undeniable evidence that
                            Bathu had been attacked and essentially confirmed the Cambodian account.
                            The U.S. Embassy, Saigon, reported on 24 January 1962 that it appeared
                            that an error in navigation had occurred and that Bathu had been hit by
                            Farm Gate aircraft participating in a <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> action against a suspected <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> concentration west of Binh Hoa.</p>
                        <p>On 25 January 1962 the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> apologized to
                            the Cambodian Government for the incident and agreed to make
                            indemnification. Though the U.S. had offered to reimburse the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> for damage payments, Secretary Thuan on
                            25 January 1962 dismissed the matter of funds as being of minor
                            importance.</p>
                        <p>On 26 January 1962, the Cambodian newspaper <hi rend="italic">Depeche</hi> carried a front page editorial focused on the
                            Vietnamese “gesture of good will” in offering regrets and expressed the
                            hope that this gesture augurs a new era in Cambodian-Vietnamese

                        <p>On February 6, 1962, Philip Bridgham of the Bureau of International
                            Security Affairs, Department of Defense, prepared a paper entitled
                            “North Vietnam and Sino-Soviet Relations” for several officials,
                            including the Assistant Secretary for International Security Affairs.
                            Covering the period 1949-1961, it made the point that North Vietnam in
                            varying degrees had cast its lot ideologically with China more than with
                            the Soviet Union, but had tried to mediate the growing dispute between
                            the two in 1960 and 1961. It closed with the following paragraph:</p>

                        <p>“In sum, North Vietnam in the years 1960-1961 achieved a new status of
                            independence and influence within the Communist bloc. As a major
                            beneficiary of the Sino-Soviet dispute in the form of vastly augmented
                            economic and military assistance from both Moscow and Peiping during
                            this period, the North Vietnamese party leadership have every reason to
                            persist in their chosen role of mediator and neutral in the deepening
                            conflict between the Soviet Union and Communist China.” (Washington

                        <p>3. The aims of the Plan are:</p>
                        <p>(a) to control, protect and win the population with particular emphasis
                            on the rural areas;</p>
                        <p>(b) to obtain the intelligence necessary to break the Vietcong
                            organisation within the population;</p>
                        <p>(c) to isolate the armed Vietcong from the population and then to
                            eliminate them;</p>
                        <p>(d) to establish and maintain “white” dress which have been cleared of
                            Vietcong.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">General Concept</p>
                        <p>4. This is a battle for the control of the villages and the protection of
                            the population. If security and Government control are restored, then,
                            with the assistance of the people themselves, the elimination of the
                            Vietcong will automatically follow. The Vietcong cannot exist unless
                            they can intimidate and gain the support of elements in the population.
                            They depend on these elements for supplies, food, intelligence and
                            recruits. This is a continual traffic and represents the weakest link in
                            the Vietcong organisation. In order to isolate the armed units of the
                            Vietcong from the population it will be necessary to break this link and
                            to eliminate. Vietcong supporters within the population. In order to
                            achieve this it is essential to establish a solid security framework in
                            the populated areas.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Security Framework</p>
                        <p>5. The foundation of the security framework will be strategic hamlets and
                            defended hamlets:</p>
                        <p>(a) the conception of strategic hamlets is well understood and many have
                            already been established. This policy will be extended as rapidly as
                            possible in all areas where strategic hamlets are sufficient to provide
                            effective protection for the population.</p>
                        <p>(b) In all areas where villages and hamlets have been under Vietcong
                            control or which are continually threatened by major Vietcong units,
                            particularly on the perimeter of the populated areas (i.e. along the
                            Cambodian frontier and on the fringes of swamp areas which have been
                            lone established communist bases), houses wiI1 be regrouped and defended
                            hamlets will be established.</p>
                        <p>6. It will be essential to establish the frame work solidly and in depth
                            so that strategic and defended hamlets are mutually supporting. There
                            must be no gaps. Under no circumstances will strategic and <pb n="104" xml:id="pg_104" facs="0124"/>defended hamlets be established in
                            isolated groups unless such groups can be rapidly linked together by the
                            establishment of further such hamlets in between. It will normally be
                            desirable to establish strategic hamlets in the more secure areas of
                            each province expanding steadily outwards to the less secure areas where
                            defended hamlets may be required. Chefs de Province will also pay
                            particular attention to the need to coordinate the establishment of the
                            framework with neighbouring provinces in order to ensure that there are
                            no loopholes along provincial boundaries.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Defence of the Framework</p>
                        <p>7. The framework will depend for close defence mainly on the Self-Defence
                            Corps supported by the Republican youth as part-time members of the
                            Self-Defence Corps. Immediate dose support in a mobile role will be
                            provided by the Civil Guard. Where defended hamlets are established in
                            areas which have been heavily penetrated by the Vietcong it may be
                            necessary to employ Civil Guard in their close defence until such time
                            as reliable Self-Defence Corps units can be called. During the
                            establishment of the framework it will be the task of the Army to keep
                            the regular units of the Vietcong harassed and off balance so that the
                            security framework can be consolidated. The efforts of both the
                            intelligence organisation and of the information services will be
                            directed in support of the Plan</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Control Measures</p>
                        <p>8. In order to establish control over the population and to assist in
                            cutting the supply line to the armed units of the Vietcong, the
                            following control measures will be introduced:</p>
                        <p>(a) Priority will be given to the issue of new plastic identity cards to
                            the whole population in the Delta area. The inhabitants of each house
                            will be recorded and a photograph of the complete household, together
                            with identity card numbers, will be placed inside the house, and
                            duplicate photographs will be available at district and province
                            headquarters.</p>
                        <p>(b) Permanent check points will be established at selected static posts,
                            on all roads and waterways. There will also be surprise checks at other
                            points.</p>
                        <p>(c) Curfews will be introduced on certain roads and waterways and in
                            areas surrounding defended hamlets, and any such other areas as may be
                            required, from 7.00 p.m. until 6.00 a.m. The necessary authority will be
                            given for the security forces to shoot on sight at anyone breaking the
                            curfew.</p>
                        <p>(d) In certain areas of jungle, mangrove swamps and marshland, prohibited
                            areas will be declared and the population will be totally excluded until
                            further notice and all security forces will be given complete freedom to
                            shoot on sight in such areas.</p>
                        <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105" facs="0125"/>
                        <p>(e) In certain areas, particularly on the perimeter of the populated
                            areas, measures will be introduced to control the movement of rice and
                            other supplies. Where necessary food convoys on certain roads and
                            waterways will be introduced. In certain villages and hamlets rice
                            stocks will be purchased and removed from the area immediately after
                            harvesting and a rice ration will be issued to the inhabitants.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Protection</p>
                        <p>9. As already stated under the General Concept in paragraph 4, the
                            protection of the population will be based on strategic and defended
                            hamlets with the Self-Defence Corps (now being rapidly expanded,
                            re-equipped and trained) providing the close defence, supported by the
                            Republican Youth, and with the Civil Guard providing mobile support. The
                            Army will at all times be prepared to rescue any post which is under
                            attack by the Vietcong.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Winning the Population</p>
                        <p>10. There are three main requirements:</p>
                        <p>(a) Great attention will be paid at all times to the behaviour of all
                            government personnel both civil and military in their dealings with the
                            population. Under no circumstances wiI1 punitive measures be taken
                            against any village or hamlet without the prior approval of the National
                            Security Council. Great care will also be exercised when ground attack
                            aircraft or artillery are used in populated areas to ensure that
                            innocent persons are not wounded or killed.</p>
                        <p>(b) The population should be kept well informed with regard to all
                            control measures and of their purpose. These measures will be relaxed
                            when an area is cleared of Vietcong and declared “white”. Where hamlets
                            have to be regrouped the population should be given every assistance and
                            should be kept well informed of the advantages which will follow from
                            such regrouping.</p>
                        <p>(c) As the framework is established and an area is cleared of communists,
                            social and economic improvements will immediately be undertaken.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Civil Authorities</p>
                        <p>11. The main tasks of the Civil Authorities will be:</p>
                        <p>(a) the establishment of strategic and defended hamlets;</p>
                        <p>(b) the administrative organisation of the villages;</p>
                        <p>(c) the introduction of control measures;</p>
                        <p>(d) the provision of social and economic improvements with emphasis on
                            agricultural improvements, health measures, education and minor public
                            works;</p>
                        <p>(e) publicity for all government measures and propaganda directed at both
                            the population and the terrorists.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Self-Defence Corps</p>
                        <p>12. The main tasks of the Self-Defence Corps will be:</p>
                        <pb n="106" xml:id="pg_106" facs="0126"/>
                        <p>(a) close defence of strategic and defended hamlets;</p>
                        <p>(b) active patrolling in the immediate neighbourhood of strategic and
                            defended hamlets;</p>
                        <p>(c) collection of intelligence, particularly on communist supporters
                            within the populated areas, and on communist supply lines;</p>
                        <p>(d) elimination of armed communist cadres within the population and
                            arrest of communist supporters;</p>
                        <p>(e) distribution of information and propaganda leaflets.</p>
                        <p>13. The training and equipment of the Self-Defence Corps will proceed as
                            rapidly as possible and which will be established in all strategic and
                            defended hamlets. Great care, however, will be taken to ensure that such
                            units can be adequately and rapidly supported by Civil Guard units in
                            the event of a Vietcong attack developing and if necessary by the Army,
                            which will be responsible for dealing with any large Vietcong
                            concentration which may develop against Self-Defence Corps units in such
                            hamlets.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Civil Guard</p>
                        <p>14. The main tasks of the Civil Guard will be:</p>
                        <p>(a) to provide mobile and offensive patrols outside strategic and
                            defended hamlets, particularly on the perimeter of populated areas,
                            including patrols on inland waterways;</p>
                        <p>(b) to rescue Self-Defence Corps posts when attacked;</p>
                        <p>(c) to provide the close defence of defended hamlets where the
                            Self-Defence Corps is either inadequate or not yet raised;</p>
                        <p>(d) to enforce the control measures in paragraph 8.</p>
                        <p>15. The Civil Guard will be organised to provide for the permanent
                            defence of the security framework within each province. The battalion
                            headquarters will become the provincial headquarters of the Civil Guard,
                            and a company headquarters will be established as the district
                            headquarters of the Civil Guard. Additional companies will be allocated
                            to each province as required for operations. As the security situation
                            improves, these additional companies will be transferred elsewhere. A
                            company headquarters will; however, always remain at district level,
                            though the number of men in that company may be reduced. The total
                            strength, therefore, of the Civil Guard in each province will vary
                            considerably, but the headquarters framework at province and district
                            level will always remain. The retraining of the Civil Guard companies
                            will continue as rapidly as possible, and river patrol units will be
                            trained and established</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Military Units (Including Rangers)</p>
                        <p>16. The initial aim of military units will be to keep the main Vietcong
                            forces off balance and harassed while the framework of strategic and
                            defended hamlets is being established and consolidated. Their main tasks
                            will therefore be:</p>
                        <p>(a) active patrolling and engagement of Vietcong units outside the
                            populated areas;</p>
                        <p>(b) prevention, by planned operations, of Vietcong concentration;</p>
                        <p>(c) support of hamlets in bad areas and rescue of them if attacked;</p>
                        <p>(d) enforcement of control measures, especially curfews and prohibited
                            areas.</p>
                        <p>17. As the framework is established, military units will gradually be
                            relieved of all static duties (other than defence of their own
                            establishments) and, where any static duties remain, a mobile reserve
                            will always be available. Ranger companies will be withdrawn from the
                            populated areas as soon as they can be replaced (if required) by
                            retrained Civil Guard companies. Those that remain in the Delta area
                            will be retrained for deep-jungle operations in Tactical Zone 31.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Air Force</p>
                        <p>18. The main tasks of the Air Force will be:</p>
                        <p>(a) to increase the mobility of the military and Civil Guard units in
                            areas where other communications are lacking, particularly for offensive
                            operations;</p>
                        <p>(b) to provide reconnaissance and communications;</p>
                        <p>(c) to attack targets of opportunity;</p>
                        <p>(d) to evacuate all wounded (including civilians) from isolated areas; </p>
                        <p>(e) to drop information and propaganda leaflets.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Navy</p>
                        <p>19. The tasks of the Navy will be:</p>
                        <p>(a) to prevent entry into the Delta area of Vietcong supplies,
                            reinforcements, agents and weapons by sea;</p>
                        <p>(b) to prevent all Vietcong movement by water along the coasts and in the
                            river estuaries in close liaison with the Civil Guard river patrol
                            units;</p>
                        <p>(c) to transport troops and supplies rapidly in the coastal areas;</p>
                        <p>(d) to support operations in the coastal areas and in the major channels
                            of the Mekong.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Important Points</p>
                        <p>20. In establishing the framework great attention will be paid to the
                            following points:</p>
                        <p>(a) The complete co-ordination of all civil and military action;</p>
                        <pb n="108" xml:id="pg_108" facs="0128"/>
                        <p>(b) A clear chain of command</p>
                        <p>(c) The direction and co-ordination of the intelligence effort,
                            particularly at District level;</p>
                        <p>(d) The direction and co-ordination of the information services and
                            pay-war units and all information and propaganda directed at both the
                            population and the Vietcong;</p>
                        <p>(e) The establishment of wireless communications down to the village
                            level and to defended hamlets and other key posts;</p>
                        <p>(f) The domination of inland waterways to deny their use to the
                            Vietcon2;</p>
                        <p>(g) The exploitation of the Government's superior means of communication
                            to achieve mobility, flexibility and economy of force;</p>
                        <p>(h) The relief of the Army from static defence duties;</p>
                        <p>(i) The tactical siting of Self-Defence Corps and Civil Guard posts to
                            achieve several objects simultaneously e.g. to defend a hamlet and a
                            bride and to provide check points on a road or river;</p>
                        <p>(j) The integration of all establishments, installations and training
                            centres of a military nature within the framework</p>
                        <p>(k) The protection of major food convoys by both road and water;</p>
                        <p>(1) Supporting action by the Republican Youth Corps and Civic Action
                            teams at the village and hamlet level;</p>
                        <p>(m) Prompt medical attention for all persons (including civilians)
                            wounded by Vietcong action</p>
                        <p>(n) Prompt payment of compensation (where authorised) for damage to
                            property or loss of life;</p>
                        <p>(o) All matters affecting the morale both of the population and
                            Government forces.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Communist Reaction</p>
                        <p>21. The communists will not be slow to react to the establishment of the
                            framework and will make a determined and violent effort to prevent it
                            being established and to break it. This requires that there should be
                            careful judgement and timing in each Province in the establishment of
                            the framework and that all forces should be ready to counter communist
                            attempts either to break it or to encourage the population to resist
                            certain of the measures. As the framework is consolidated, the
                            communists will be forced to attack it and, at this stage, the Army
                            particularly must be alert to deal with communist concentrations and
                            attacks on defended hamlets.</p>

                        <p>22. The Secretary of State at the Presidency and Assistant for Defence
                            will be responsible to the National Security Council for the execution
                            of the Plan and will issue such instructions as are necessary for
                            implementing it. These instructions will cover:</p>
                        <p>(a) the points in paragraph 20;</p>
                        <p>(b) the establishment of strategic and defended hamlets;</p>

                        <p>1. Now that we are about to get the new command in Vietnam under way
                            after all the road blocks which have been encountered to delay its
                            establishment, I would like to bring you up to date on the situation
                            here.</p>
                        <p>2. In drafting the JCS message which you received today<note n="2" xml:id="d52fn2">See <ref target="#d53">Document 53</ref>.</note> I
                            attempted to make it clear that insofar as DOD and the JCS are
                            concerned, your terms of reference are those which were agreed to by
                            Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and which were approved
                            by the President when Sec Def, JCS and <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> visited Palm Beach in early January. As you know
                                <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> was not too happy
                            with them and for that reason it is desirable that they be handled most
                            discreetly, particularly in your contacts with him. I discussed the
                            importance of doing so with <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> during our last visit to Honolulu and I am sure
                            he understands the situation in this regard. The importance of holding
                            these terms of reference closely is obvious.</p>
                        <pb n="110" xml:id="pg_110" facs="0130"/>
                        <p>3. As you are aware the necessary arrangements for the establishment of
                            the command and announcement thereof have been made with President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>. He has given his
                            complete concurrence to the entire project and is looking forward with
                            much pleasure to working with <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>.</p>
                        <p>4. It now appears that our next visit to Honolulu will be on 19 Feb.
                            While you are in the best position to judge when <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> should leave for Saigon and
                            whether he will be able to return for that conference, I believe that it
                            would be most advantageous if he could leave Honolulu fairly promptly
                            and return with <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> for
                            the conference on the 19th.</p>
                        <p>5. With respect to <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>'
                            promotion, he presently holds a recess appointment as general. The
                            President signed the necessary papers during our Palm Beach visit on 3
                            Jan. Accordingly, the promotion papers to be forwarded by <gloss target="#t_DA1">DA</gloss> will confirm that fact. They have been
                            closely held since Jan 3 for security reasons. Therefore Harkins should
                            wear his fourth star as of 081600Z, the time of the public release. The
                            papers which will send his promotion to the Senate for confirmation are
                            now in the White House and will be forwarded to the Senate by the
                            President at 1100 AM Washington time Thursday, 8 Feb. when the command
                            announcement is made. Assistant Secretary of Defense Sylvester will make
                            an appropriate announcement of the promotion at that time.</p>
                        <p>6. For <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>. Again my
                            heartiest congratulations to you on this well-earned and justly deserved
                            promotion. In undertaking your new and challenging assignment you can
                            count on the wholehearted support of the President, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, the JCS and their respective
                            staffs here. I know that Felt, O'Donnell, Collins and Aides and their
                            commands and staffs will also give you all possible support and

                            of this item by stating that he had asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> to make an oral
                            presentation on his report to the President on Viet Nam.<note n="2" xml:id="d54fn2">See <ref target="#d42">Document 42</ref>.</note> Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> said that he felt
                            such a presentation would allow a personalized approach which would not
                            be reflected in the written report.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> stated that he was distressed over any concern of the JCS
                            which might have arisen as a result of his oral presentation to the
                                President.<note n="3" xml:id="d54fn3">According to the President's
                                log, <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>
                                met with the President from 7 until 8 p.m. on January 29.</note> He
                            certainly had not intended any reflection on anyone and had not known of
                            the matter until Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> had
                            brought it to his attention. General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> accepted this explanation for the JCS and
                            stated that the JCS were happy to have Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> present with
                            them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said that he would like to stress and expand on a few key
                            points contained in his report. First, we must get across to the liberal
                            press the fact that it does not necessarily follow that the existence of
                            guerrilla war in Viet Nam means that the government is unpopular and
                            bad. The village people live an inward existence and are concerned
                            largely with their own immediate problems. They have no regional or
                            national feelings or loyalties, and while they are basically
                            anti-communist, they are still very isolated. The people respect
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>, but they do not have
                            any feeling of love or admiration for him.</p>
                        <p>Second, the importance of the existence and availability of Viet Cong
                            infiltration routes has been overplayed. The establishment of a
                            completely effective wall across the border would not unduly affect <pb n="114" xml:id="pg_114" facs="0134"/>the Viet Cong activities. While
                            the Viet Cong does use these routes to bring new regular Army cadre
                            personnel into South Viet Nam, they do not rely unduly on them for
                            anything else.</p>
                        <p>Third, the Viet Cong has ready access to the villages, and it does not
                            employ any great degree of terror tactics against the villages. They buy
                            their rice at premium prices from the villagers and do not take property
                            or food by force. The Viet Cong does, however, obtain money and goods
                            through actions against business people such as robbery, blackmail, and
                            ransom. Most of their arms are obtained or manufactured locally and do
                            not come in over infiltration routes. There is a great deal of Viet Cong
                            small arms manufacture taking place in South Viet Nam. The true Viet
                            Cong logistic lines stem out from the villages where they obtain rice,
                            arms, and recruits. The Viet Cong have access to, and are using, about
                            2,000 such villages.</p>
                        <p>Fourth, we must institute a program of civic action which will tie the
                            villages to their districts and to the central government. These
                            programs must be designed to assist the villages with their problems and
                            by performance demonstrate to the villagers that they can expect help if
                            they ask for it. The few hard-core Viet Cong supporters in the villages
                            must be removed through aggressive police work. This will require the
                            establishment of a system of ID cards, personnel checks, etc. The
                            villages must be provided effective physical protection which in turn
                            will permit the control of movements of supplies and personnel. The
                            problem is a tactical one involving combat, and not strategic
                            intelligence operations. We must get across to the villages the fact
                            that we will provide them real and adequate protection against revenge
                            if they provide us information and assistance.</p>
                        <p>Fifth, the regular army is static and relatively immobile as a result of
                            its role of defending strong points. We must free it to act as a mobile
                            force. We must institute a full reorganization of all friendly forces at
                            the working level along the lines of basic guerrilla principles and
                            counter-insurgency tactics. Aggressive patrolling must be instituted.
                            When these patrols make contact with the enemy, they should call in the
                            Jungle Jim units and the paratroopers. We should not rely on helicopters
                            for attacking.</p>
                        <p>Sixth, <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> is in a difficult
                            political situation. State has been pushing him too hard for reforms.
                            Many of these reforms are not necessary and perhaps some are
                            undesirable. More reforms should be pressed at the lower levels.</p>
                        <p>Seventh, we need many more U.S. company grade officers and <gloss target="#t_NCO1">NCO</gloss>'s to assist on the spot. We also need
                            effective police type training and assistance. The strategic village is
                            not the key because it really is only a fort of sorts. The key element
                            is the zone. We must establish zones and control them by civil guards
                            with the Army ready to step in <pb n="115" xml:id="pg_115" facs="0135"/>to assist. We have to put the Viet Cong in a meat grinder. By cutting
                            off access to the villages, they will have to attack, and we should be
                            in a position to react with superior force.</p>
                        <p>Eighth, the purely military effort is going well, but we must complement
                            it by equally effective civic action programs. Self-defense units must
                            be established, and they do not require more than minimum training. This
                            must be a rapid program, and it should be conducted simultaneously with
                            a leadership program for selected people from the villages.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> noted that we
                            had already faced the problem of a lack of native recruits for present
                            programs. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said that we need about 1,000 company grade
                            officers and <gloss target="#t_NCO1">NCO</gloss>'s (Special Forces type
                            people) to train personnel and set examples. We must show the way at the
                            bottom and ease the pressure on the top echelons. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said that
                            there are no effective gimmicks to substitute for people. He noted that
                            the results of the defoliation program have been marginal. The real
                            solution is men who will go out into the jungle, live there, and close
                            with the enemy. General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> said that the U. S. military in Viet Nam had
                            the same objective.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_AGWJ1">Anderson</persName> asked Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> how much time he had spent in Viet Nam in preparing his report.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> replied that he was in Saigon for five days.<note n="4" xml:id="d54fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> traveled to Vietnam on January 15,
                                following the Honolulu Secretary of Defense's Conference. He
                                witnessed the Binh Hoa operation on January 21 and then returned to
                                the United States.</note> General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> asked how many police officer personnel would
                            be required for training the Viet Namese. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> estimated that
                            about 200 would be required and noted that the British and the Malayans
                            would be prepared to provide part of this number of people. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> remarked that we
                            now have about 3,000 U.S. personnel in Viet Nam and that the present
                            program called for a total of about 6,000. He then noted that General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> had recommended
                            the institution of provincial civic action studies in Viet Nam.<note n="5" xml:id="d54fn5">See <ref target="frus1961-63v01#d210">

                            only military and intelligence people. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> pointed out that <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> had vetoed the inclusion of political and economic
                            people in these study groups. General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> said satisfactory progress in civic action
                            required the development of a comprehensive plan of action by the Viet
                            Namese. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> indicated that such a plan had been prepared by the
                            British and was under study by <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s people. General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> said that our <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> people had not been forceful in their actions. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> agreed that <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> should do more
                            and that its Public Safety Division should be improved. He said that
                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> is the weakest element in the
                            civic action program. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>
                            asked just <pb n="116" xml:id="pg_116" facs="0136"/>what we should
                            expect from <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said that
                            we should not expect too much from <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
                            and that we may have to move the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
                            into the field of police type action and training.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_AGWJ1">Anderson</persName> asked if he was
                            correct in assuming that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> did not feel that the U.S. military
                            in Viet Nam had been sufficiently effective, helpful, imaginative, and
                            resourceful. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said that our decision to support rather than
                            just advise the Viet Namese was a very recent one and that until that
                            time our people in Viet Nam were merely advisors, as we all were. He
                            said that probably no government ever had so much advice. Accordingly,
                            we cannot blame our people on the spot for any lack of positive action
                            since they were instructed to act as advisors. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_AGWJ1">Anderson</persName> then asked if Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> and General
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> agreed with Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName>'s views on the required actions in Viet Nam. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> replied
                            in the affirmative. General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> remarked that we must now build up our
                            resources in Viet Nam. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said that while Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> agreed with his general
                            approach, he could not state positively that they agreed with all of the
                            details of his report. General <persName corresp="#p_DGH1">Decker</persName> asked if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> had discussed his report
                            with General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName>. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said that he had not because he did not begin to write it until
                            after he had left Saigon. He had not sent a copy of the report to
                            General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> because Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> had asked him not
                            to make any distribution of the report outside certain Washington
                            Agencies for the time being.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> noted that the
                            JCS have a strong directive from the Secretary of Defense regarding
                            provision of full support to our effort in Viet Nam. He asked if other
                            Agencies of the U.S. Government have similar directives. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName>
                            said that <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> does not.</p>

                                North and South Vietnam for violations of the 1954 Geneva Accords
                                and offered several alternatives to the then-current U.S. practice
                                of not notifying the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> but overtly

                        </p>
                        <p>1. In connection with points made reftel, Department has examined
                            question notification personnel and equipment in light of position taken
                            by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in note sent <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> Dec. 9, 1961. (Saigon 769.<note n="3" xml:id="d55fn3">Dated December 7, 1961, not printed. (Ibid.,

                        <p>As Department views Accords, two obligations are involved: (a) One
                            involves the obligation to notify <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> of
                            any arrivals or departures of personnel or equipment; (b) the other
                            relates to the obligation not to introduce foreign troops, military
                            personnel, arms and munitions, other than as authorized by the
                            Accords.</p>
                        <p>2. Department now inclined to view that December 9 note from <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>
                            may be considered as a notification within meaning Accords, since <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> thereby informed of intended <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> increased support in men and material
                            over and above that which authorized by Accords. We do not believe
                            specific numbers, figures, amounts, and quantities need be notified as
                            envisaged by Accords, since purpose Dec. 9 notification not to stay
                            within limits provided for in Accords, but rather to place on record
                            fact limits would be exceeded in view existing situation.</p>
                        <p>3. Second question is whether introduction fresh troops, military
                            personnel, arms and munitions, beyond limits authorized by Accords, can
                            be justified to <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>. On this point,
                            under clearly recognized principle of international law, non-observance
                            of a treaty obligation by one party to that treaty justifies an
                            equivalent corresponding or related non-observance by the other party.
                            This principle is subject to the limitation that aggrieved party may
                            only continue non-observance of its treaty obligations until resumption
                            of observance by other party.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, in replying to <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>'s letter of
                            Jan. 6<note n="4" xml:id="d55fn4">Not found.</note> regarding <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> increased support in men and material,
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> might base its answer on <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0138"/>foregoing principle. In fact,
                            this point already made in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s
                            December 9 note which stated, among other things, that “in view
                            aggression being waged by so-called <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            against <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in flagrant violation Geneva
                            Accords, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has requested <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> increase support in men and material
                            which it has accorded in past. Right of self-defense being inherent and
                            legitimate attribute of sovereignty, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            obliged by NVN's contempt for life and property of free people of VN and
                            by its breaches of GA to exercise this right and appeal for increased
                            assistance.” At same time December 9 note recognized limitation on this
                            principle by stating that “As soon as authorities in NVN end their
                            aggressive acts and begin observe Geneva Accords, these measures of
                            support can be terminated.”</p>
                        <p>4. In view of foregoing, it would appear that question of notification
                            has already been dealt with by December 9 note, and that further
                            notifications are unnecessary, since, as noted above, purpose of
                            notification is to permit <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> verify
                            that amounts not exceeded and December 9 notification clearly indicated
                            intention to break ceiling for reasons stated therein. Only question
                            left for <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> to consider is whether
                            action taken can be justified on grounds noted above. This point raises
                            issue of subversion. Subversion then will clearly become issue with
                            which <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> will have to deal and which it
                            cannot ignore.</p>
                        <p>5. Believe that case on subversion can persuasively be made to Canadians
                            and Indians by using above legal argument and by also setting problem in
                            its broader context as follows:</p>
                        <p>(a) What is at stake in Viet-Nam is question of world-wide concern: how
                            can community of nations identify nature of subversive warfare as a
                            violation of world peace just as flagrant, just as violent and just as
                            dangerous as overt war of Korean style? <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> has trained troops on its own territory and infiltrated
                            them over period time into South Viet-Nam instead of using them in overt
                            and massive attack. Its agents have directed the present insurgency in
                            South Viet-Nam, using newly infiltrated troops, personnel left in place
                            when country was divided and local recruits. Its own General Giap has
                            described the type of war it is waging, placing the world on notice. It
                            cannot be dismissed as not being aggression because the pattern of
                            aggression it presents is new and novel.</p>
                        <p>(b) The <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> has so far avoided central
                            issue and, months after <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s complaints
                            of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> subversion, matter is still being
                            sifted through legal committee. US considers <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> must lift its sights to face this issue which is at
                            heart of insecurity in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>. US believes
                                <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> can fulfill important role in
                            beginning to formulate body of legal doctrine to control subversion.</p>
                        <p>(c) US policy toward Viet-Nam is clear: US does not menace NVN nor seek
                            its reconquest. US does intend to provide <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, with all means necessary to preserve its independence.
                            US will cease its exceptional aid once <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> ceases its attempts to destroy <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119" facs="0139"/>
                        <p>(d) US appreciates difficulties of Indians and Canadians but considers it
                            would be damaging if <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> cited <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and US in violation Geneva Agreements
                            without citing <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> for its
                            responsibility for situation in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.
                            Record is clear that increased US aid has been answer to increased
                            subversion, regardless of present attempts of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to obscure facts. We would hope therefore that <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> would first consider <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> complaints on subversion before
                            considering those of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. If this
                            absolutely not feasible we would nevertheless consider two issues linked
                            since <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in responding to <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> citation would be expected inject issue
                            of subversion by way of defense.</p>

                        <p>Dear Cot: Fritz has asked me to make an interim response to your letter
                            of January 26 regarding Farmgate bombing operations.<note n="2" xml:id="d58fn2">Not found. </note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The best evidence I can give you that the points which are troubling you
                            have not escaped our notice here is the enclosed draft telegram. The
                            latter is addressed in terms to the question of crop defoliation, but
                            the arguments are of course applicable to area bombing and this is well
                            understood. (This, incidentally, is the draft Task Force message
                            referred to in <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>'s MAGPO 779,<note n="3" xml:id="d58fn3">

                        <p>As of now, Fritz is reserving judgement on the conclusions arrived at in
                            this message. He takes a more pragmatic approach and, before reaching a
                            position, would want to see the results of a review such as that
                            suggested in the second paragraph of your letter. Given the fairly <pb n="122" xml:id="pg_122" facs="0142"/>desperate position we find
                            ourselves in in Viet-Nam, he wants to be very sure of his ground before
                            rejecting any weapon which might help to win the war, and he is
                            understandably reluctant to draw conclusions on vital questions on the
                            basis of a priori reasoning—which is about all we have to go on at this
                            point. Moreover, he is particularly anxious not to be recorded in
                            Washington as for or against the operation in question until there has
                            been an opportunity for further, objective study. In other words, he is
                            very keen that this not become at this stage—or, hopefully, ever—an
                            inter-departmental issue between State and Defense.</p>

                            psychological reaction. Efforts now being made determine if plans have

                            by Vietnamese in VNAF helicopters, they apparently feel it their show

                        <p>Despite this understandable <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            impatience, Task Force has reluctantly concluded <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> concept of use defoliants against crops is ill
                            conceived and, if implemented, would have effect increasing <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> strength rather than decreasing it.</p>
                        <p>As indicated above, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> proceeds from
                            premise inhabitants areas controlled by <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> consist entirely <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            troops and “sympathizers”, thus any means may be used against them. Task
                            Force does not accept this premise. On contrary, we believe that even in
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> controlled areas populace still
                            susceptible being won by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> if proper
                            tactics used. Problem in military/political warfare taking place here is
                            to separate guerrillas physically and psychologically from people and to
                            win latter's allegiance to government. Admittedly this is lengthy and
                            tortuous process, but it is only means achieving meaningful victory in
                            type of warfare such as that confronting Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>Widespread food denial program, like area bombing recommended by
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> from time to time, is
                            completely at odds with this approach. It might well inconvenience
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> units and supporters in areas
                            affected but it would also insure ill will of whole of population these
                            areas, thereby increasing overall <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            strength there.</p>
                        <p>Various ways of mitigating this effect have been suggested, notably
                            resettlement and food distribution programs in areas where crop warfare
                            conducted, but for several reasons we inclined to doubt value such
                            measures. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> reps have argued <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> will simply resettle with afflicted
                            population and will be in forefront those demanding replacement food.
                            These points well taken, we believe, and illustrate difficulties
                            administering such a program. Furthermore, because <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> doubts wisdom resettlement and food
                            replacement, such programs would probably not be effectively
                            implemented, even if accepted on paper.</p>
                        <p>We therefore now see no alternative but to conclude that type of crop
                            warfare program envisaged by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would
                            not contribute to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> victory and might
                            in fact make such victory even more difficult obtain. This conclusion
                            based purely local factors and is without regard international
                            aspects.</p>
                        <p>We recognize that <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> may be
                            highly displeased this opinion. However, only alternatives are:</p>
                        <p>a) to permit <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to proceed with
                            defoliant operations in its own way—which we believe would be
                            counter-productive for reasons stated above; or</p>
                        <p>b) to insist on detailed case-by-case review by U.S. of proposed
                            operations. Because of lack of independent intelligence, we have no
                            sound basis for making such review and particularly for deciding with
                            assurance that given operation would affect only hard-core <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. This procedure if conscientiously
                            implemented would therefore be source continuing invitation in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>-US relations.</p>
                        <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124" facs="0144"/>
                        <p>Task Force therefore recommends <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> be informed we prepared continue road clearance
                            program, if trials demonstrate its effectiveness but that we will not
                            support defoliant food denial operations at this fume.</p>

                        <p>1. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> reports
                            that he is in trouble with the press because of a) press exclusion from
                            helicopter missions, b) exclusion from boarding USS <hi rend="italic">Core</hi> at Cap St. Jacques and c) discrimination arising from

                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> requests authority “be
                            given Task Force Saigon to decide on local correspondents' requests to
                            cover field operations in which U.S. participating, including arrival of
                            equipment when deemed advisable.”</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. A large number of experienced, responsible American journalists are
                            now in Viet-Nam covering a newsworthy development—the participation of
                            U.S. military men in South Viet-Nam's war.</p>
                        <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0145"/>
                        <p>2. Until recently, our press coverage from Viet-Nam has been on the
                            critical side—a search for a culprit responsible for the downward trend
                            in the war against the Viet Cong. Critics point to President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> and his tightly controlled
                            government and military services as the impediment to success.</p>
                        <p>3. In my opinion, the only way this unfavorable publicity—originating
                            mostly from malcontents in Saigon—can be reversed is through registering
                            successes in the security effort. The criticism will then abate and the
                            reporting will be directed to the factual progress in the war.</p>
                        <p>4. I believe we have almost reached the bottom of the downward curve. The
                            results of our imminent adoption of a coordinated strategic plan
                                (<persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> ideas appear to be converging)
                            plus the men, materials, and training should bring about a gradual
                            upward curve favoring the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>5. Consequently I believe it important that our press representatives in
                            Saigon be treated effectively in order to achieve the best constructive
                            coverage. The attached article from <hi rend="italic">U.S. News and
                                World Report</hi>,<note n="3" xml:id="d59fn3">Not found
                                attached.</note> with a “box” entitled “Curtain of Secrecy” saying
                            that this “looks like a U.S. Embassy effort to confuse and disguise the
                            situation” is a sample of the kind of coverage we do not want.</p>
                        <p>6. Since Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> is on
                            the scene and in constant touch with the newsmen, I believe he should be
                            charged with the responsibility of press relations and coverage, with
                            appropriate advice from Washington. He should be allowed to permit
                            coverage of certain operations, taking into account the military
                            commander's opinion, and he should provide the newsmen with appropriate
                            guidance.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Recommendation</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. That we concur in Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>'s request for authority (1013)</p>
                        <p>2. That we provide him guidance, i.e.:</p>
                        <p>a) That he should emphasize to newsmen in backgrounders that we are not
                            taking over the direction of the war; that we are “in support of” the
                            Vietnamese; that therefore they should not over-emphasize the U.S.
                            role.</p>

                            forth reference telegram in some detail to Commonwealth Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_GYD1">Gundevia</persName> February 13. He
                            listened attentively and then commented as follows: large-scale influx
                            US aid clearly transgresses Geneva accords. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> position as made clear informally to <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> was that if US assistance could be
                            covered under GA, this was “all right with <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> up to a point”. However, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has made no effort whatsoever do this. Thus, way things
                            are going, impossible situation being created for <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_GYD1">Gundevia</persName> went on to ask what
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> thought would happen if <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>/VN were to abdicate? He thought open
                            war would result. Added that Parthasarathy sending “frantic” telegrams
                            saying he has already had protest from <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and USS <hi rend="italic">Core</hi> deliveries and
                            matter will be brought up with him by Poles. On issue subversion,
                            Gundevia said <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> bound hand and foot by
                            GA and cannot change rules. If <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            wishes see a conference convened and rules rewritten this another
                            matter, but experience at Laos Conference in this respect is anything
                            but encouraging precedent. <persName corresp="#p_GYD1">Gundevia</persName> referred to policy statement on subversion
                            agreed by <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>/VN in 1961 after months of
                            wrangling and Polish opposition. Said <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> cannot investigate subversion, as this outside GA, but
                            can investigate breaches of specific GA provisions. (Gundevia, who has
                            been away from MEA for 4 months, did not refer to work apparently
                            currently being done on subversion issue by <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> legal committee—third paragraph Saigon's 999 to
                                Department<note n="3" xml:id="d60fn3">See <ref target="#d60fn2">footnote 2</ref>, <ref target="#d55">Document
                            55</ref>.</note>—and he may not be abreast of it. Could Department or
                            Saigon summarize <pb n="127" xml:id="pg_127" facs="0147"/>substantive
                            status for our background, since Saigon's 999 seems indicate some
                            possibility <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> being cited for
                            subversion, which seems contrary to thrust of <persName corresp="#p_GYD1">Gundevia</persName>'s comments.)</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_GYD1">Gundevia</persName> said acting Canadian
                            Hicom Campbell came in few days ago with proposal that <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> investigate a specific <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> charge each time it takes up a <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> complaint, in order obtain simultaneous
                            citation <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_GYD1">Gundevia</persName>
                            admitted <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> concealing violations but
                            said US committing “daylight robbery” and that this not <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>'s fault. <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> cannot juggle words or ignore what is openly taking
                            place. Thus he saw little chance that simultaneous citation could be
                            achieved or that repeated citations of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> could be avoided.</p>
                        <p>4. According <persName corresp="#p_GYD1">Gundevia</persName>,
                            Parthasarathy feels that US assistance to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> outside GA has gone so far that situation heading for
                            crisis and real danger hostilities. <persName corresp="#p_GYD1">Gundevia</persName> said he not so pessimistic over immediate
                            situation as Parthasarathy but thinks future black. Parthasarathy holds
                            that “moderates” in <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> weakening and
                            extremists gaining on issue of letting ChiComs in.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_GYD1">Gundevia</persName> reverted to favorite
                            thesis by asking whether US wants another Korea. In event shooting war,
                            said ChiComs would take over “whole area”. Asked whether US had
                            attempted talk seriously to Soviets on Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>6. Comment: Foregoing summarizes <persName corresp="#p_GYD1">Gundevia</persName>'s lengthy and often rambling and emotional
                            comments. <persName corresp="#p_GYD1">Gundevia</persName> did not
                            contest US view that subversion is at heart of insecurity in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>, which I pressed hard, but fell back on
                            restrictive <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> terms of reference. He
                            did not address himself to US legal argument regarding increased
                            support. <persName corresp="#p_GYD1">Gundevia</persName> clearly worried
                            and uncomfortable, and protested several times that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> caught in middle of thankless task,
                            which many people wished India were out of, since India being blamed for
                            events over which she has no control. <persName corresp="#p_GYD1">Gundevia</persName> concluded by saying he thought matter had been
                            carried as far as possible in this session but he wished have another
                            talk with me in few days. I asked <persName corresp="#p_GYD1">Gundevia</persName> what was tenor of MEA's recent instructions to
                            Parthasarathy and he said latter had been told to press for early
                            decisions on Nam case and other pending issues.</p>
                        <p>7. Would welcome Department's observations and further guidance.</p>
                        <p>Department will appreciate there is virtual vacuum in MEA at this time,
                            with PM away electioneering and Desai ill. <persName corresp="#p_GYD1">Gundevia</persName>, who far from well himself, therefore likely be
                            calling shots on <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> policy toward
                                <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> and Viet-Nam for at least some
                            weeks, which is unfortunate.</p>

                        <p>1047. I am sorry to have to raise again the matter of US organizational
                            arrangements in Vietnam. However, an issue of principle and a question
                            of my personal good faith vis-à-vis the government of Vietnam are
                            involved. On the basis your letter of January 20,<note n="2" xml:id="d61fn2">See <ref target="#d40">Document 40</ref>.</note> and
                            in response to specific questioning on this point from President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>, I gave him written
                            assurance on February 2<note n="3" xml:id="d61fn3">Not further
                                identified.</note> that “the US Ambassador will continue to be the
                            senior US representative in Vietnam, responsible for coordination and
                            supervision of US official activities here, including, of course,
                            relations with your government.”<persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> stressed to me that it was on the basis of this
                            assurance that he concurred in the establishment of the new Command.</p>
                        <p>(In response to persistent questions, I also made substantially the same
                            reply to the press on a background basis.)</p>
                        <p>In the light of your statement that there is now “No piece of paper”, I
                            was surprised and disappointed to see CINPAC's 081600Z,<note n="4" xml:id="d61fn4">

                            passed to me. This message, repeated apparently to all military
                            establishments subordinate to <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> as well as to JCS, sets out the terms of reference
                            for the commander, US Military Assistance Command Vietnam, in precisely
                            the same terms as those to which I had made clear to you and Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> my objections and
                            which I had understood from your letter were to be dropped.</p>
                        <p>In the circumstances, I should appreciate a clarification. In view of the
                            personal commitments I have made to President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> and in view of my belief that the
                            chances of success here depend on clear US organizational arrangements,
                            as explained more fully in my proposed letter to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> sent you from Honolulu on

                            explained to you earlier in Washington, accept the responsibility
                            attaching to this assignment on the basis set out in the <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> message cited above. I am not
                            prepared to carry forward on a task of this magnitude and importance
                            under conditions which have unfortunately now developed, where ambiguous

                        <p>I hardly need add that none of this reflects in any way on General

                        <p>Last month in Washington the President requested me to let him know if I

                            I therefore request that this matter be brought to his attention, and

                        </p>
                        <p>We seem headed for a major domestic furor over the “undeclared war” in
                            South Viet-Nam and of US imposed “secrecy regulations” that prevent
                            American newsmen from telling our people the truth about US involvement
                            in that war.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Our Embassy in Saigon has called to our attention the fact that it is
                            having considerable difficulty with American newsmen who deplore what
                            these newsmen believe are regulations that make it impossible for them
                            to do their jobs. These newsmen specifically want the right to function
                            much like war correspondents and accompany US personnel on various
                            operations against the Viet-Cong Communist guerrillas.</p>
                        <p>In the hope of easing relations with the press, our Embassy and military
                            commanders in Saigon have requested the right to make on-the-spot,
                            case-by-case judgments as to when newsmen might be permitted to observe
                            military operations.</p>
                        <p>Our present policy is that a flat rule prevails against newsmen going on
                            helicopter and other military missions, or being permitted into areas
                            where they might report in detail on what US military men are doing.</p>
                        <p>It has been explained that this rule has been applied in the interest of
                            national security—that we do not want to telegraph our punches for the
                            enemy, and that we do not want news reports to build up a detailed
                            record that might be cited as evidence of our violation of the Geneva
                            accords.</p>
                        <p>While in complete agreement with this objective, I do believe that our
                            policy is too broadly restrictive, and that it was adopted without
                            consideration of some press factors that must be considered. The current
                            article in the <hi rend="italic"> US News and World Report</hi> (Tab
                                A),<note n="2" xml:id="d62fn2">None of the tabs referred to in the

                            and editorial in yesterday's <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> (Tab
                            C), the charges in the publication of the Republican National Committee
                            (Tab D—article by Jack Raymond, also from yesterday's <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>), and as yet unpublished reports submitted to
                                <hi rend="italic">Time-Life</hi> (I shall have them at the meeting
                            this evening<note n="3" xml:id="d62fn3">No record of this meeting has
                                been found.</note>) are all indications that we run the risk of
                            serious domestic political consequences if we fail to give proper
                            attention to our information policies with regard to South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>I am setting forth my views on four points that I think we ought to bear
                            in mind in reviewing the appropriateness of our present embargo on
                            newsmen in Saigon:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">This policy almost certainly will not continue for
                                long to deprive the newsmen of the information we want most to keep
                                out of public print.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Covering the Viet-Nam situation are people like Homer Bigart, Keyes
                            Beach, Howard Sochurek, etc. These fellows have spent a good part of
                            their lives covering wars of one kind or another; they have substantial
                            reputations to protect and, if possible, enhance; they aren't going to
                            sit on their hands just because of our embargo. They will <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0151"/>pump our returning soldiers, use
                            Viet-Namese sources, and generally get the information they want. Less
                            enterprising reporters there will seize upon rumors and resort to
                            so-called interpretive pieces that the boys in the trade call “thumb
                            suckers”—a kind of story that often can cause more woe than the facts.
                            Their colleagues in Washington will pounce on letters written to
                            Congressmen by relatives of GI's injured or killed in Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, a look at the material Sochurek has submitted to <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> is proof enough that the press boys already
                            have enough detailed information about troops and material to paint a
                            disturbing picture of US involvement.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">By imposing unrealistic regulations we will create a
                                completely hostile press and insure that the newsmen will write just
                                the things we hope to prevent.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Even our friends will do pieces that will grieve us. The Reston column
                            and the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> editorial are examples of this.</p>
                        <p>In a situation like this a government has two possible fundamental
                            approaches:</p>
                        <p>to impose a system of rigid wartime censorship, or</p>
                        <p>to cooperate with the press enough to maintain rapport and a mood of
                            mutual trust so as to use the leverage of personal contact to influence,
                            if not control, what information the newsmen put out.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">We presently are inviting a barrage of attacks on
                                President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> and on our
                                policies and past actions in South Viet-Nam.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Newsmen who feel unjustly deprived of the right to cover military
                            operations will do more interpretives such as the Keyes Beech piece in
                            yesterday's <hi rend="italic">Washington Post</hi>. Sochurek's file to
                                <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> is loaded with rugged criticism of
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>, of <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> and our Embassy people and of
                            our military personnel.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">We must not expect the impossible from the
                                press.</hi> There is bound to be major emphasis on the activities of
                            US personnel. This is the nature of news. People in Austin, Texas, care
                            a lot more about what US GI's are doing in Viet-Nam than about the dirty
                            work of the Viet Cong. Only through good relations with American newsmen
                            can we “infiltrate” their dispatches with some of the information that
                            we want to get to the public.</p>
                        <p>Nor can we ever muffle all criticism of <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>. Doubts as to our ability to win with him are too
                            widespread among newsmen who have spent months on the scene. With good
                            relations, we can get a wide measure of silence by astutely invoking the
                            national interest—but not otherwise.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. That we adopt a more flexible policy with regard to the handling of
                            newsmen in Saigon.</p>
                        <p>2. That the Ambassador be given authority to determine what military
                            operations, if any, newsmen might witness.</p>
                        <p>3. That we provide the Ambassador with guidance as to the things we hope
                            the press will avoid, and suggest that he brief them confidentially as
                            to our problems and our need for their understanding and
                            cooperation.</p>

                        <p>Attached is a paper prepared by <persName corresp="#p_SWA1">Warren
                                Silver</persName> of the Vietnam Task Force staff on the FY 1962 and
                            FY 1963 Project <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> Programs for
                            Vietnam. This paper illustrates in a very graphic way the fact—known to
                            many of us for some time—that our economic <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> program is not in very good shape in Vietnam and has
                            not been well related to our other efforts. Even where new programs are
                            being added that appear to be more closely related to the counter
                            insurgency effort, as in the case of the “rural development” program on
                            the 4th page of the tabular material, we know so little about the
                            intended content of the program in Washington that approval is being
                            given more or less on the basis of “blind faith.”</p>
                        <p>The paper was discussed at a Task Force meeting which I attended
                                today.<note n="2" xml:id="d63fn2">A record of the meeting is in
                                Johnson Library, Vice Presidential Security Files, State Dept.
                                1961-63.</note> As a result of that meeting, the following seemed to
                            be tentatively agreed:</p>
                        <p>a. That it would be desirable if at all possible, to send a team,
                            including military as well as <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
                            members to Vietnam within the next two weeks to review both the FY 1962
                            and FY 1963 programs in order to bring them into closer alignment with
                            our counter insurgency effort. <pb n="133" xml:id="pg_133" facs="0153"/>These programs contain a large element of conventional <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> activities. Ideally, this team should
                            have the power to make decisions in the field.</p>
                        <p>b. There seemed to be general agreement that it would not be desirable to
                            adopt the proposal put forth by <persName corresp="#p_SWA1">Silver</persName> that the new <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> Director be a military officer who would be a Deputy
                            to General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>. It seemed
                            agreed the problem was one primarily of communication between the
                            military and the <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> in Saigon and
                            between the <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> and Washington. It was
                            agreed that this problem could be better attacked in other ways
                            including possibly meetings between Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HF5">Hamilton</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>
                            Director in Honolulu on the order of the regular military meetings
                            there.</p>
                        <p>In the course of the discussion, I suggested that one approach to the
                            problem of the FY 1962 program would be to provide funds for civic
                            action in support of the sort of program that had been recommended by
                            the U.S. military civic action team that went to Vietnam. It was pointed
                            out that that team's proposals still awaited approval by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. It was also indicated that once a
                            program was established there would be no problem of getting <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> funds to support it. A message to
                            Saigon on civic action is presently being cleared.<note n="3" xml:id="d63fn3">See <ref target="#d66">Document 66</ref>.</note> It
                            would propose that any civic action undertaken be in the form of
                            “packages” involving little or no local effort.</p>
                        <p>It was pointed out that our more conventional view of civic action
                            assumed a degree of community spirit and recognition of the social
                            values of community effort which simply did not exist in a country like
                            Vietnam. Vietnamese farmers, when pushed, can be forced to admit that an

                            provided them with identifiable benefits. However, their principal
                            reaction to such projects will be to complain bitterly about the
                            personal effort involved. They would like the work done by “American
                            machines”.</p>
                        <p>The proposed telegram on civic action would, inter alia, propose the
                            creation of travelling medical teams. Vietnamese doctors might be
                            induced to undertake such duties through promising them scholarships for
                            study abroad after completion of a two or three year tour of duty.<note n="4" xml:id="d63fn4">At the end of this memorandum was written by

                        </p>
                        <p>1. The Taylor Mission priorities should be adopted for the projects in
                            the FY 1963 economic program;</p>
                        <p>2. All FY 1962 projects in the <gloss target="#t_CEP1">CEP</gloss>
                            (Country Economic Program),<note n="6" xml:id="d63fn6">Not
                                printed.</note> both continuing and new, should be approved;</p>
                        <p>3. The <gloss target="#t_CEP1">CEP</gloss> should be reviewed at once in
                            Saigon by Task Force Saigon (including the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>) with the collaboration of an officer from <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> and from DOD, and in consultation with
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, to bring the FY 1963 program
                            into line with the Taylor Mission priorities;</p>
                        <p>4. Consideration should be given to whether or not, in FY 1963, the
                            economic program in Viet-Nam thus revised and co-ordinated with the
                            military effort, should be directed by a military officer who will be a
                            deputy to the Chief, USMAC Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Discussion:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. The Taylor report says that the economic program for Viet-Nam
                            should:</p>
                        <p>a. Expedite projects that are particularly useful in the short run;</p>
                        <p>b. Continue successful long-range projects but defer new starts for the
                            time being; and</p>
                        <p>c. Review long-range projects for possible modification or
                            termination.</p>
                        <p>The Vietnamese Special Financial Group in July, 1961, said that Viet-Nam
                            then had eighteen months to win its survival and in that period should
                            concentrate on those activities designed to achieve it. This view is
                            consonant with the recommendations of the Taylor report, and a similar
                            view was expressed by President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>.</p>
                        <pb n="135" xml:id="pg_135" facs="0155"/>
                        <p>The Country Economic Program (<gloss target="#t_CEP1">CEP</gloss>) for FY
                            1963, which includes the program for FY 1962, states valid objectives
                            (page 2): (1) successful counter-insurgency, (2) engage the loyalty of
                            the people, (3) increase economic growth, (4) reach the less privileged
                            groups.</p>
                        <p>To achieve these objectives, however, the <gloss target="#t_CEP1">CEP</gloss> proposes a program that does not use the Taylor
                            priorities (page 37). The <gloss target="#t_CEP1">CEP</gloss> says (page
                            29) that long-range (development) activities and short-range (impact)
                            activities are usually inseparable because no really significant or
                            complete benefits can be conferred in a short time. This point of view
                            rejects the significance of results obtained say, during the period
                            between now and the end of FY 1963 (e.g. mobile medical and evacuation
                            teams, population regroupments) and those results obtained later. The
                                <gloss target="#t_CEP1">CEP</gloss> says, indeed, that long-range
                            projects with no immediate benefits demonstrate to the people the value
                            of their country and their government for the future. This approach
                            offers a future promise to people in present need; it overlooks, as they
                            do not, that they may not be here to enjoy the fruits of the
                            promise.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_CEP1">CEP</gloss> says, further, that insecurity
                            does not make long-range activities more difficult than short-range
                            activities; but this overlooks the main point that insecurity makes
                            long-range activity less important than short-range activity.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps if there were no lack of skilled people, technicians and
                            administrators, both the long and short-range activities could be
                            carried out; and the <gloss target="#t_CEP1">CEP</gloss> says the
                            existence of this lack is not critical. But the existence of this lack
                            dictates a choice of projects to which to apply the human resources
                            there are in Viet-Nam, and the Taylor priorities give a sound basis for
                            choice.</p>
                        <p>In this context of prompt effectiveness, the measure of “usefulness”
                            under the first Taylor priority would be support of the war directly
                            (e.g. medical, communications, transportation) or by speedy realization
                            of economic and social benefits.</p>
                        <p>2. The FY 1962 program:</p>
                        <p>It is too late to apply these priorities to the FY 1962 project program.
                            (Note that the commodity portion of the aid program, which is the major
                            part, is proceeding independently of the problems discussed in this
                            paper.) The <gloss target="#t_CEP1">CEP</gloss> indicates (page 39) that
                            the program has not been worked over with the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, nor (page 40) with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. Washington does not have the information, the
                            documents, or access to the people in Task Force Saigon and the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, that would permit review of the FY
                            1962 projects in time to bring them into line with the Taylor
                            priorities, and there is not enough information presently in the <gloss target="#t_CEP1">CEP</gloss> to support such a review. Nor should
                            Saigon alone be asked to do the job in expectation of early results
                            unaided. For FY 1962 it would be more productive to rely on the field
                            and approve the <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0156"/>continuing
                            projects and new projects recommended by the field. This keeps the
                            program going and starts new projects that, on their face, seem
                            acceptable.</p>
                        <p>3. The FY 1963 program:</p>
                        <p>Approval of the FY 1962 program then leaves the remaining few months of
                            FY 1962 to work out the FY 1963 program on the basis of the Taylor
                            priorities, and in full consultation with the American military and the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. When FY 1963 begins, continuing
                            projects can proceed under the usual continuing authority, and any
                            further new projects can be readied for the FY 1963 laws. This process
                            should be started now. An <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> officer
                            and a DOD officer should go from Washington to take part in the process.
                            They should go through the <gloss target="#t_CEP1">CEP</gloss> FY 1963
                            projects with Task Force Saigon on the basis of the Taylor priorities,
                            securing additional explanations where not now in the <gloss target="#t_CEP1">CEP</gloss>, and taking part in the addition of
                            projects, building up of existing projects or parts of projects,
                            abatement or discontinuance of other projects, and the consultations
                            with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. They should bring back the
                            FY 1963 program for approval, ready to start with FY 1963 itself.</p>
                        <p>4. Since the FY 1963 program would best be geared to a military
                            operation, whereas the normal AID program is now geared, in substance
                            and in administering, to long-range economic development, it would be
                            inefficient to ask for a special administrative arrangement in <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> for the war in Viet Nam. Present
                            operating personnel in USAID would be continued in their work, but the
                            program as a whole would be run by a military officer answering directly
                            to the military commander who, in turn, answers for all operations in
                            Viet Nam to the Ambassador. Additional personnel as required would come
                            from civilian or military sources. The source of financing of the
                            economic program would depend on the decision of the Administrator. Such
                            treatment of the program would distinguish it before the Congress from
                            those programs more capable of treatment under the prevailing
                            legislation.</p>

                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Military Civic Action</hi>. In October of last year
                            a DOD civic action team completed a study of <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>'s civic action program. We have informally seen the
                            team's report,<note n="3" xml:id="d64fn3">Not found.</note> but
                            understand that DOD has not yet accepted their recommendations. In any

                            received a civic action plan from DOD or any request for action.</p>

                            Progress on some of these projects is being held up pending <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> approval of the FY 62 <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> program. One of the delayed projects
                            affects the Montagnards. The Task Force has pressed <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> for fast action on the FY 62 program,
                            to the point of loaning one of our officers to them for a week. We are
                            actively studying means for putting <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> Saigon on a war footing.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has a Ministry of Civic Action
                            which includes responsibility for Youth, Information, and the old
                            department of civic action. The functions of the Ministry are varied and
                            its cadres are involved in propaganda and political organization and
                            control of the population as well as true rural improvement work which
                            we might regard as civic action. Nevertheless, it has an on-going civic
                            action program which probably could be strengthened, and we will ask the
                            field to consider ways of accomplishing this.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Provincial Surveys</hi>. You also inquired about the
                            failure of the provincial survey teams to include civilian and political
                            elements. The chief reason for this failure is that President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> agreed to the provincial surveys
                            with the proviso that they not be concerned with political factors, but
                            would confine themselves to the military and intelligence side.</p>
                        <p>The teams have now completed the pilot phase of the provincial survey, a
                            survey of three provinces (Bien Hoa, Tay Ninh, and Binh Long). The
                            Embassy member of the pilot team has submitted despatches covering the
                            political situation in two of the provinces (Tay Ninh and Binh
                                Long).<note n="8" xml:id="d64fn8">Not further identified.</note>
                            While the political and civilian elements in the provincial situation
                            will not be jointly covered, they will continue to be reported to us
                            insofar as they can be observed by the Embassy member of the team.</p>
                        <p>The Task Force also regards the failure to cover political factors as a
                            serious shortcoming in the provincial survey, but sees no better
                            solution, given <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s attitude.
                            The Task Force believes the provincial surveys are useful even within
                            their truncated terms of reference.</p>

                            Feb. 6)<note n="2" xml:id="d65fn2">
                                <ref target="#d48">Document 48</ref>.</note> in which detailed guide
                            lines are spelled out for handling newsmen there covering the military
                            strife.</p>
                        <p>It is the view of this Bureau, of <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>,
                            of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SA9">Sylvester</persName> in Defense and of
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName> of Task Force
                            Viet-Nam that press problems in Saigon are of the greatest importance,
                            and that detailed instructions for dealing with correspondents are
                            urgently needed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SA9">Sylvester</persName> makes the point that
                            our major problem arises from the fact that military leaders in Viet-Nam
                            are straining to get out from under Embassy control and deal with the
                            press as they see fit. Significantly, Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> has pointed to this same
                            problem. Thus I raise the question of whether the instructions to
                            military commanders in paragraph four of the proposed telegram are
                            worded too diplomatically.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SA9">Sylvester</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName> and Mr. Manning each has made
                            independently the observation that the military operation in Viet-Nam is
                            large enough, and the press problems and implications important enough,
                            to deserve the full-time attention of a top-flight information man.</p>
                        <p>I recommend that prompt attention be given to the proposal that we get a
                            savvy individual who is skilled at dealing with newsmen and assign him
                            to this job. This in itself would go far to show our desire to
                            co-operate with newsmen. Such an individual should have the confidence
                            of Washington to the extent that he would receive the same information
                            given to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> and
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>. He would
                            maintain frequent contact with Washington so as to ascertain any policy
                            shifts, or to be apprised of any informational or propaganda problems
                            growing out of the Viet-Nam operation.</p>

                        <p>Feeling here is that civilian civic action must give direct benefits to

                        <p>Attached are the Agenda items for the Honolulu meeting.</p>
                        <p>As you know we are particularly interested in Item 5 “The Concept of
                            Close-In Air Support”, Item 8 “The Military Civic Action Program”, and
                            Item 9 “The Status of Provincial Surveys”.</p>
                        <p>The question of close-in air support is one which I discussed with the
                            Air Force planners in the Pentagon Thursday morning,<note n="2" xml:id="d67fn2">February 15. No record of the meeting has been
                                found.</note> stressing repeatedly that they would make more enemies
                            than friends unless they are very careful. <persName corresp="#p_WCB1">Ben Wood</persName> also reminded them that the President had
                            delimited the U.S. military role in Viet-Nam quite clearly in <pb n="142" xml:id="pg_142" facs="0162"/>his last news conference,<note n="3" xml:id="d67fn3">See <ref target="#d68fn3">footnote 3, Document
                                    68</ref>.</note> saying that U.S. troops were engaged in
                            training and logistic support, that they are not engaged in what would
                            generally be considered combat. If there were press stories to the
                            effect that U.S. military are bombing and strafing Vietnamese villages,
                            we would have serious political problems. I gather that General LeMay
                            had talked to them on the same line, that they are willing to cooperate,
                            but wanted a clear set of rules under which to operate. I suggest the
                            following as a simple rule: U.S. planes should not attack ground targets
                            in Viet-Nam unless 1) their assistance is requested by troops on the
                            ground who are engaged, or are about to be engaged, with the Viet Cong,
                            or 2) the targets to be attacked are specifically cleared by the
                            Ambassador or his Deputy in the Embassy. The second provision would
                            emphasize that the political implications of this war are at least as
                            important as the military. I do not think that this would cause serious
                            delay since they would still have a free hand to move in fast when there
                            was an actual fight and I am sure that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> could work out a system
                            whereby permission or refusal could be given promptly.</p>
                        <p>As to Item 8, civic action, there has been a great deal of talk but not
                            too many specific ideas. Herewith are three suggestions which you might
                            wish to bring up: (1) that we support existing Vietnamese civic action
                            teams which reportedly have been operating near Zone D since August
                            under the direction of General Cao. We understand they are very short of
                            supplies; (2) that the Vietnamese Government order its troops to
                            automatically and promptly give rewards in rice, salt, or money to
                            persons giving information on the Viet Cong (there is too much tendency
                            to treat persons who give information as suspicious characters); (3)
                            that in the present widespread state of the war in Viet-Nam it will
                            probably be necessary to assign considerable number of American and
                            possibly third country <gloss target="#t_NCO1">NCO</gloss>s to work with
                            the Vietnamese in organizing defense and civic action in the villages.
                            This will be a difficult decision since good <gloss target="#t_NCO1">NCO</gloss>s who could fit into the Vietnamese way of life are hard
                            to find in large numbers and it will present the political problem of
                            increasing American casualties. The Australians, Malayans, Filipinos,
                            and even the Koreans and ChiNats might also be asked to supply some of
                            their <gloss target="#t_NCO1">NCO</gloss>s.</p>
                        <p>The thinking behind this suggestion is set out most clearly in <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName>'s
                            “A Strategic Concept for South Viet-Nam” which is attached. You might
                            want to review this book on the way out since it is the best statement
                            of how counterguerrilla actions should be conducted in Viet-Nem that I
                            have seen. However, if you use these ideas I would not cite <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> or
                            his book since the military are resentful of it.</p>

                        <p>As to the status of the Provincial Surveys, Item 9, we understand that
                            three provinces have now been surveyed (Bien Hoa, Tay Ninh and Binh
                            Long). While the Embassy has submitted preliminary reports on Tay Ninh
                            and Binh Long provinces,<note n="4" xml:id="d67fn4">Not further
                                identified.</note> we have not received the actual provincial

                        <p>1. The Department intends to assign John Plakies (<gloss target="#t_FSO1">FSO</gloss>-2) to Saigon as Economic Counselor. He has a thorough

                            assignment will reach Saigon soon.</p>
                        <p>2. The <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> story on Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>'s speech (attached)
                            played it as a major policy statement and headlined the idea of reforms
                            in the Government. However the article itself indicates that <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> stressed the importance of
                            supporting the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and of working with
                            it to make it more effective rather than standing aside and criticizing.
                            This is healthy advice for the Saigon intellectuals.</p>
                        <p>We are hoping the text of the speech will be received on time to attach
                            with this memorandum.</p>
                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>-State-Defense intend to send a
                            three-man team to Saigon, arriving about Friday, February 23 and staying
                            about a week. The team will work with Task Force Saigon (including the
                            USMAG) on the FY 1962 and FY 1963 economic project programs to give
                            priority to projects in support of the expanded counterinsurgency
                            program. With the collaboration of Task Force Saigon the team will hold
                            discussions with the U.S. technicians, military, and other personnel at
                            all levels of the Task Force so as to get information not presently
                            available here. Then the team will eliminate projects or parts or build
                            them up in keeping with counterinsurgency requirements. The <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> member of the team will have authority
                            to approve some projects on the spot after such discussions.</p>
                        <p>The job cannot be done in Washington without information, nor in Saigon
                            without the background of Washington discussions. Saigon seems best
                            because that is where the needed information and people are. (Cleared

                            Vietnamese with transport, communications, and various technical
                            services. We are providing the logistic facilities and skills that they
                            lack. But it is their war, and they are doing the fighting. We have not
                            publicly gone into details on numbers and kinds of equipment because of
                            military security and because of possible charges of violating the
                            Geneva Accords. Although only five Americans have been killed by the
                            Viet Cong since 1955 we recognize the dangers of this situation. Having
                            helped Viet-Nam since it became independent we do not intend to withdraw
                            our help when it is fighting to survive Communist guerilla attack.
                            Further, the fall of South Viet-Nam would endanger the future of all
                            Free Asian nations. (NB—We understand Senator Morse is particularly

                        <p>In presenting our action to the world, we have stressed the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> violations. We have publicly pledged
                            that extraordinary American aid to Viet-Nam would be terminated when the
                            Viet Cong cease their aggression. We have avoided specifics in
                            describing our efforts in order not to accuse ourselves of violating the
                            Accords.</p>

                        <p>The new U.S. military command set up in Viet-Nam February 8 was required
                            because our effort there is no longer only advisory but now includes
                            operational personnel such as helicopter and communications people. The
                            old <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> command structure did not meet
                            the needs of this activity. The new command also recognizes the
                            increased importance of our effort in Viet-Nam by assigning a
                            higher-ranking man toward it.</p>
                        <p>It does not mean that our people are to seek out and engage the enemy in
                            combat situations. It is not a combat command. It does not mean that we
                            are directing the war in Viet-Nam. This is not a joint command. The
                            Vietnamese are running their own war. The head of our Mission in

                        </p>
                        <p>(a) The loss of Viet-Nam would convince many Asians now on the fence that
                            Communism is indeed the wave of the future. We cannot afford to have
                            American support devalued by the loss of a nation <pb n="146" xml:id="pg_146" facs="0166"/>which is covered by the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> protocol and to which we are deeply
                            committed in terms both of public statements of support and in terms of
                            a large and long-standing aid program.</p>
                        <p>(b) The loss of Viet-Nam would encourage the Bloc to use similar tactics
                            of infiltration and subversion in other countries. Southeast Asia would
                            be immediately threatened.</p>
                        <p>(c) North Viet-Nam has been one of the most aggressive members of the
                            Bloc. If it succeeds in conquering South Viet-Nam, it will solve what is
                            perhaps its most pressing internal problem: food. Given its performance
                            in Laos, it seems certain that any strengthening of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> will increase the dangers faced by free
                            Asia.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The Vietnamese have the will to fight Communism. Total casualties on both
                            sides of 3,000 per month, of which over half are Viet Cong, prove that
                            the Communists are meeting strong opposition.<note n="4" xml:id="d68fn4">During 1961 total casualties were: <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>—12,686; <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>—20,390.
                                [Footnote in the source text.]</note> Even more illuminating is the
                            fact that the clear majority of Vietnamese casualties does not belong to
                            the Army but to the village defense units (Self-Defense Corps and Civil
                            Guard). Our role is to give these people the technical and logistical
                            assistance they cannot provide for themselves to enable them to win
                            their own war.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> can raise the ante. There are
                            more than 350,000 men in their armed forces—many of them natives of
                            South Viet-Nam as well as veterans of the long guerrilla war against the
                            French. They can be infiltrated into Viet-Nam via Laos with little
                            difficulty across the long and rugged border between the two countries.
                            If the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> chooses to take the risk,
                            they can compel us to take further measures or lose Viet-Nam. We do not
                            intend to lose Viet-Nam.</p>

                        <p>For thirty years <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> has
                            recognized the Communist threat to Asia. He has done all he can to
                            strengthen his country against it. He is a determined and courageous
                            man. He has been right in emphasizing the importance of defense,
                            education, communication and rural welfare.</p>
                        <p>If Viet-Nam is not a democracy, neither is any other underdeveloped
                            country. These countries must develop politically as well as
                            economically. Viet-Nam has no democratic tradition. It is divided and at
                            war. Yet <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> has held elections.
                            Opposition candidates were given equal time on the radio. They were
                            critical. They are not in jail. <pb n="147" xml:id="pg_147" facs="0167"/>President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> recently
                            followed his Cabinet's recommendation that an unpopular bill proposed by
                            his sister-in-law be returned to the National Assembly.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s strong leadership has been
                            needed to prevent factionalism which is endemic in Vietnamese
                            politics.</p>
                        <p>He has been reluctant to delegate authority, but has recently agreed to
                            our suggestions that he set up a National Internal Security Council (War
                            Cabinet) which meets twice a week and that military chain of command and
                            intelligence operations be reorganized. American advisers are playing a
                            larger role.</p>
                        <p>We support the Government of Viet-Nam and <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> as the head of that Government. The future is up to
                            the Vietnamese. We do not intend to interfere.</p>
                        <p>Since the war in Viet-Nam cannot be won without the closest cooperation
                            between our two Governments, public American criticism of <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> only succeeds in hurting our own

                        </p>
                        <p>The economic assistance program in Viet-Nam was developed (1) to provide
                            those commodities the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> cannot afford
                            out of its own resources, but which are necessary—even on an austere
                            basis in which consumer goods are minimized—to keep the economy primed
                            and pumping; and (2) to provide projects for the development of Viet-Nam
                            into a democratic self-sustaining economy. Right now, however, we are in
                            the midst of a very urgent revamping to assure priority to projects in
                            full support of the expanded counterinsurgency program. We want to speed
                            up projects that are particularly useful in the short run because they
                            support the war effort directly or by producing important social and
                            economic benefits in a hurry. While we want to continue successful,
                            long-range development projects, we are going to defer new starts for
                            the time being, and we are reviewing other long-range development
                            projects to modify them or terminate them. We especially want to work
                            out civilian (and military) projects that will have the swiftest impact
                            in winning the peasants to the government, i.e. civilian and military

                        <p>Dear President Hannah: I have recently left Saigon after spending four
                            weeks there, and given the developments there during that time it
                            occurred to me that you might be interested in my personal report on the
                            situation which prevails there.</p>
                        <p>Since I left Saigon I have had no word from the MSU people there, and can
                            only assume that the President has not reversed his decision to
                            terminate the University's contract program in Vietnam. (If he has, of
                            course, you will read the following remarks with a different perspective
                            than otherwise.) As you can easily imagine, the interview at which the
                            President informed me that he had decided against renewing the MSU
                            contract was a difficult one.<note n="2" xml:id="d69fn2">The interview
                                between <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> and Fishel took
                                place on January 24. An account of it is in a memorandum of January
                                25 from Guy Fox of the MSU Group to James Hendry, Assistant Dean of
                                the College of Business and Public Service. (Michigan State
                                University, Hannah Papers, H, Vietnam, 1962)</note> He was obviously
                            ill at ease and made it plain that he hoped the program termination
                            would not affect our personal relationship. At the same time it was
                            clear that he held me at least partially responsible for the fact that
                            MSU people had published what he called “untrue, unfair, and
                            tendentious” criticisms of his government. He tried to depersonalize his
                            decision by telling me that the members of his Cabinet had recommended
                            against our continuation. But since I had already learned that he had
                            consulted only two advisers: his brother, <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName>, and the Secretary of State at the
                            Presidency, <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Nguyen Dinh Thuan</persName>, I
                            called him on this, whereupon he repeated earlier accusations that MSU
                            personnel had been “disloyal.” Both the President and his brother
                            individually voiced implicit accusations in talking with me, to the
                            effect that our professors had used their “privileged position”, which
                            gave them access to government offices, personnel, and files, to engage
                            in intelligence <pb n="149" xml:id="pg_149" facs="0169"/>activities in
                            the guise of “research”; and had then used the information they had
                            secured to the detriment of the Vietnamese Government.</p>
                        <p>I tried to reason with <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> on
                            this, though I recognized from his manner that argument was probably
                            futile. The voice was that of the President, but the reasoning was that
                            of his brother, <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>. I am sorry to say that Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> apparently actually believes his own
                            arguments and persuaded <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> of
                            them. It is also a fact, however, that other members of the government,
                            headed by the Vice President, while sharply critical of the publications
                            in question, were fully convinced of the value of MSU's work and wanted
                            very much for our group to continue its programs.</p>
                        <p>As much as I regret the termination at this time, when all of us should
                            be making a maximum effort to keep the Vietnamese Government afloat, I
                            am relieved that the issue was resolved enough in advance of the
                            termination date to permit an orderly phasing out. And given also the
                            situation which I shall outline in the following paragraphs, it is
                            probably just as well that our work is being brought to a close, at
                            least for the present time.</p>
                        <p>For the first time in seven and one-half years I have become a pessimist
                            about the fate of South Vietnam. In the two and one-half years since my
                            last visit to that country there has been a most profound and
                            distressing deterioration there, politically, socially, and
                            psychologically. Economically, though some progress is still being made,
                            the gains of the past few years are in many cases being reversed, by a
                            combination of factors of which the major ones have been very serious
                            floods along the Mekong last fall, and sharply intensified Viet Cong
                            activity. As you may know, Vietnam is not exporting rice this year; it
                            will in fact import some. Again, there has been just enough interference
                            in normal business and investment activity on the part of the
                            government-supporting political party of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> to
                            have a monkey-wrench kind of effect on economic operations. Militarily,
                            the recent influx of thousands of American officers and men, and dozens
                            of helicopters, etc., is starting to make a distinct change in the
                            situation already, turning what was a minus into a plus. I would
                            hesitate to predict, however, that the plus will remain that for long,
                            for I find it hard to believe that the Chinese and Viet Cong will allow
                            this challenge to go unmet. Indeed, my travels to the high plateau, the
                            center, and the Mekong delta last month have left me with the impression
                            that a Viet Cong offensive is very likely in the next few weeks. By that
                            I don't mean a major invasion out of the north, but rather a heavily
                            intensified terrorization program that may spread even to the cities,
                            with the intent of panicking the population and weakening the <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> government's hold still more.</p>
                        <pb n="150" xml:id="pg_150" facs="0170"/>
                        <p>Politically and psychologically things are at a low ebb. The commendable
                            programs which were begun a few years ago have been allowed in many
                            instances to lose their momentum by reason largely of a failure on the
                            part of the Central Government to follow through on initial decisions
                            and acts. The hopes and aspirations of 1954 and 1955 have been allowed
                            to die, and a miasma of apathy pervades the atmosphere. I talked more
                            than casually with 118 people during my four weeks in Vietnam. Almost
                            all are people I have known for many years. None of them is politically
                            part of the “opposition.” At least two thirds of them were still
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s strong adherents in
                            1959. Yet today, only three or four of these men and women support the
                            government with discernible enthusiasm. Then too, there is much popular
                            fear: fear that “the Viet Cong are coming,” and that the government is
                            not going to be able to move to meet the Communist threat swiftly enough
                            to save many people from being hurt or killed. Of course, this is the
                            kind of fear which is surreptitiously encouraged by Communist agents, of
                            whom there are many in Saigon.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> himself is linked more and
                            more often with those around him—the “evil influences,” as some call
                            them. After all, he is the Chief of State and must take responsibility
                            for the acts of his entourage, whether he knows of them or not: if he
                            knows of them, he is at fault because they are “evil”; if he doesn't
                            know of them, he should by now. No one yet accuses him of wrongdoing,
                            and in fact he could recoup his former stature and support easily with
                            just a minimum of effort. But he does not see the necessity or
                            desirability of such steps, and no one who does has the courage to tell
                            him. This applies even to those few still with him who are basically
                            courageous, men of integrity and ability who despise the craven
                            flatterers who surround him and insulate him from the realities of his
                            situation. They are reluctant to tell him unpleasant truths because he
                            may dismiss them, and they know that in that case “the evil ones” would
                            put their own men into the vacancies and then even this tiny opening to
                            the outside would be closed off.</p>
                        <p>Who are these “evil influences?” As always, <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s brother, <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>, heads the
                            list, but shares his position with his wife. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>'s
                            policies have formed the philosophical basis of the regime's activity
                            for the past six years, and they have failed miserably to win the people
                            to the side of the government. But he doesn't realize this, and one
                            cannot convince him (or <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>) of
                            this. His wife is as brilliant, vivacious, bitchy, and brutal in her
                            Borgia-like fashion as ever—and with (charitably) the purest of
                            intentions she is succeeding in alienating substantial segments of the
                            population from her brother-in-law's regime at a time when it needs the
                            enthusiastic support of everyone. She is the sponsor, for example, of an
                            asinine bill that passed the National Assembly by a questionably secured
                            majority: the “Social Purification Law.” <pb n="151" xml:id="pg_151" facs="0171"/>This silly legislation, rammed through the Assembly in
                            the name of “austerity” and “mobilizing the population”, prohibits
                            dancing or the teaching of dancing, even in private homes, bans
                            dissemination of birth control information, devices, or medications, and
                            would regulate all sorts of other activities and practices including
                            public displays of affection, certain kinds of dress, etc.<note n="3" xml:id="d69fn3">In the margin next to this sentence is written in an
                                unidentifiable hand: “<persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>
                                has returned this bill to the assembly for reworking.”</note> Coming
                            from a Catholic it is interpreted to mean that Catholic dogma is being
                            forced on the people, which means that it is creating inter-religious
                            frictions where few have existed previously. Then there is the Secretary
                            of State at the Presidency, <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Nguyen Dinh
                                Thuan</persName>, a shifty, ambitious, clever, and unscrupulous-but
                            able-administrator, who has his eye on even higher position, and some
                            American friends who think he would be easier to handle than <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>. Much as I do not wish to see the
                            influence of the Nhus continue, the elevation of <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> is not to me the answer either.
                            For this man is as well hated as the Nhus (who put him into his job,
                            incidentally) and a likely candidate for assassination, either by the
                            Communists or by many others who detest him as a man who has tasted
                            power and likes it too well, and who climbed to his present position on
                            the backs of those who were his friends and benefactors.</p>
                        <p>The US role in all this is, as ever, of mixed quality. The determined
                            military effort we are now making is likely to help a good deal; our
                            economic measures will also help. But these steps are helping only to
                            warm the fingers and the toes; the body itself needs badly to be warmed
                            too if it is to be kept alive. Unless Vietnam experiences a major and
                            favorable psychological shock within the next few months, I doubt
                            seriously whether it will survive, notwithstanding our efforts and our
                            money and our men. The bright spots which were so clearly visible two
                            and even one year ago are now fading into insignificance because the
                            regime still has failed to mobilize the hearts and loyalties of the
                            people. This is ironical, for this is a regime which has based its
                            system of appointment to office on “loyalty.” And ironical too is the
                            fact that this regime, which has a philosophical base (synthetic and
                            unloved) of “personalism,” which teaches that every man has the right to
                            the fullest development of his personality, has failed miserably to
                            enable men to do just that. (I am not speaking of civil liberties
                            here—they are still a side issue, by and large—I speak of the freedom of
                            men to rise in their chosen professions to positions of responsibility,
                            to improve their status by their own efforts, by demonstrating their
                            capacities and their talents.) I think here of all the young men I have
                            known and worked with in Vietnam (including Nguyen Thai, who is once
                            more back at MSU, and Vu Van Thai, who reportedly is now at Harvard),
                            who have the qualities of leadership which Vietnam will <pb n="152" xml:id="pg_152" facs="0172"/>need in the years ahead, but who have
                            been alienated and their development stifled and smothered by the heavy
                            hand of their government. (But I must clarify one point here: the
                            Vietnamese Government is not malicious or predatory or vicious or
                            particularly oppressive, especially if it is compared with the regimes
                            of neighboring countries. Rather it is a clumsy and bumbling government
                            which has failed to take advantage of one opportunity after another, and
                            which has not dared to take the risks involved in implementing its
                            avowed ideas, and which has not carried successful programs to their
                            successful conclusion.)</p>
                        <p>Perhaps my rhetoric has left you with the impression that I have written
                            my friend off. I have not. However, I am firmly of the opinion that
                            unless what I have termed the “evil influences” are removed from the
                            scene in one way or another, <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Ngo Dinh
                                Diem</persName>'s government is not going to make the grade. Support
                            for the government is dwindling, and one finds evidences of a growing
                            feeling of desperation among the able and hitherto loyal men and women
                            who have supported it. Unless the situation can be changed for the
                            better, we are in for a very bad period in Vietnam.</p>

                        <p>Dean Seelye himself intended to write both you and President Hannah this
                            morning but he was called suddenly and unexpectedly to see President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>. It was necessary for
                            Dean Seelye to go directly from the interview to the aiport. Therefore,
                            he has requested me to report on developments here and to send a copy of
                            my memorandum to President Hannah.</p>
                        <p>On Thursday, February 15, Dean Seelye and I met with Secretary of State
                            at the Presidency <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Nguyen Dinh
                                Thuan</persName>. The attached memorandum for the record<note n="2" xml:id="d70fn2">A record of this meeting by Fox, February 16, is
                                ibid.</note> gives an account of that meeting. Though <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> was cordial he made it clear that
                            the President considered the articles by <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> and Child<note n="3" xml:id="d70fn3">Presumably a
                                reference to Milton C. Taylor and Adrian Jaffe, “Crumbling Bastion,”

                            believes it inadvisable for MSU to continue here. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said the President realizes MSU
                            cannot exercise control over project returnees and therefore believes it
                            better that the government directly hire advisors who can be prevented
                            from writing “irresponsibly” and “unfairly” on political matters.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>, who was quite
                            friendly during the meeting this morning, revoiced much of what
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> had said. The President
                            said he was grateful for the assistance and achievements of MSU and
                            praised the good work of the overwhelming majority of our personnel. But
                            he said he was deeply hurt and shocked by articles written by MSUG
                            professors after their return to the United States. The Child and
                                <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>
                            articles—especially that of Child—urged the forceful overthrow of the
                            government, he said. If Child and <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> had written the articles while they were in
                            Vietnam the President said they would have been tried before a tribunal
                            for fomenting an insurrection. <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> did not appear bitter, but, rather, shocked and
                            disappointed that “those in whom he had placed confidence and trust” had
                            fumed against him. The President expressed the view that the interest of
                            the government would be served best by having foreign advisors hired by
                            the NIA. This arrangement, he believed, would insure control by the
                            government over the advisors' publications. Of course, Dean Seelye
                            outlined the University's position, with which you are familiar. He said
                            in effect that whereas he did not agree with much of the material from
                            the <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>-<hi rend="italic">Child</hi> articles the University must recognize the right of
                            returnees to write freely so long as they do not disclose genuinely
                            secret information—he believed <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would
                            have to weigh the total good of our efforts against the relatively small
                            number of objectionable articles.</p>
                        <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154" facs="0174"/>
                        <p>The President became sentimental toward the end of the meeting, reviewing
                            the years of warm, harmonious relations with MSUG, again expressing his
                            appreciation for our work here and asking <hi rend="italic">Dean
                                Seelye</hi> to convey his best wishes to President Hannah.</p>
                        <p>There is one other development of which I should apprise you: On February
                            15 just before our meeting with <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>, Malcolm Browne, of the Associated Press, called
                            for an interview with Dean Seelye. He said he had heard the MSU contract
                            was not to be renewed because of the writings of our returnees. We
                            haven't the least idea where he received the information, but the news
                            now seems to be all over Saigon. Because he was tied up with various
                            meetings—including one with American Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>-Dean Seelye delayed having a
                            meeting with Browne until the next day. In the meanwhile he took up with
                                <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> the question of
                            dealing with the press. <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>
                            said he supposed there was little we could do but tell the truth that
                            the Government of Vietnam did not want a contract because of
                            objectionable articles by former MSUG members. <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> seemed quite concerned that
                            the President might make a big issue of the government's position
                            vis-à-vis MSU.</p>
                        <p>On the sixteenth Dean Seelye met with Browne. Browne said he thought he
                            had a real story here because fundamental principles of freedom of press
                            were involved. He recounted his own difficulties with Vietnamese
                            censorship, which has prevented him, he said, from telling the American
                            people of the actual conditions here. At one point during the interview
                            both Dean Seelye and I emphasized was that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has never on any occasion asked MSU to muzzle returning
                            scholars nor indicated it would want a contract renewal in the event we
                            agreed to throttle returnees. The government, he said, simply objected
                            to the writings of our former members and as a result did not believe it
                            advisable to have us continue beyond the expiration of the present
                            contract. Browne asked if we believed the government would have agreed
                            to a renewal if we had agreed to curb freedom of expression of
                            returnees. We said quite candidly we did not know, because the matter
                            had never arisen. The government had never made such a request and we
                            certainly have not and would not make such an offer. I mention this
                            point specifically because in Browne's release he has said that Seelye
                            said “the government had asked his university to order returning MSU
                            professors not to write articles criticizing the national
                                administration.”<note n="4" xml:id="d70fn4"> Malcolm Browne's
                                despatch, February 17, appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Washington
                                    Post</hi>, February 13. 1962.</note> There are other
                            inaccuracies in the release. For example, Browne says that Seelye, who
                            has always been on cordial terms with the President, has been unable to
                            confer with the President this time. As I have already mentioned, Dean
                            Seelye did meet with the <pb n="155" xml:id="pg_155" facs="0175"/>President. In another place Browne said that Seelye would return to
                            the United States “without the contract renewal he had sought.” As a
                            matter of fact we told Browne that Seelye was here to present the
                            conditions under which the University would accept a new contract and to
                            precipitate a decision from <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. I am
                            sending you a copy of <hi rend="italic">Browne</hi>'s release, which
                            contains several other minor misrepresentations.</p>
                        <p> Dean Seelye left today at 2:30. While in Saigon he talked not only with
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> but with various other
                            governmental officials, such as the Secretary of State for National
                            Economy, Thanh; Dean Thuc, Director of the Law School; and the President
                            of the Bank of Vietnam. He also had discussions with officials and
                            faculty at the NIA and saw a number of persons in private business such
                            as the President of the Bank of China, President of the Chamber of
                            Commerce.</p>

                            At the American Embassy he met with the Ambassador, with Bogardus of the

                        <p>1. Items of interest developed at the Task Force Meeting of 21 February
                            are indicated below.</p>
                        <p>a. The organization of the State-Defense-<gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> economic group to proceed to Saigon for review of FY-62
                            and FY-63 economic aid programs, decided upon at the 15 February
                                meeting,<note n="2" xml:id="d74fn2">See <ref target="#d63fn2">footnote 2, Document 63</ref>.</note> was discussed. The
                            project is bogged down by <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> delay in
                            naming a representative chartered to make on-the-spot decisions; <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> has asked Saigon <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> director <persName corresp="#p_GAZ1">Gardiner</persName> for his views on the trip, which will result in
                            additional delay and possible haggling on whether the trip is needed at
                            all. The reason for the trip is basic—to modify the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> programs so that project
                            characteristics are compatible with the C.I. strategy and will support
                            it in proper order of priority.</p>
                        <p>b. Defense indicated dissatisfaction with the progress and results of the
                            provincial surveys. The military and intelligence objectives now being
                            undertaken are not being met because team membership is too small and
                            not enough time is devoted to each province. For example, there is need
                            of data on numbers and location of <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>. Defense feels there should be
                            economic representation so that later civic action in the province
                            pacification strategy can be properly planned. There should be more
                            teams and a priority approach to parallel the 10 provinces selected for
                            military pacification; the whole project should be speeded up. At
                            Honolulu, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> was
                            moderately receptive to these criticisms; he was reluctant to push
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> indicated State support for
                            any needs the Ambassador indicated. In the Task Force, <persName corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName> said the Honolulu discussion
                            seemed to focus on the shortcomings and he would assume Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> will get with it;
                            further, he asked the economic group to look into the matter when in
                            Saigon. [This response was not very strong to say the least; I talked to
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HLC1">Heinz</persName> and suggested he
                            buck this to the Special Group (C.I.) next week through Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName>.]<note n="3" xml:id="d74fn3">At the March 1 Special Group (<gloss target="#t_CI1">CI</gloss>) meeting, it was agreed that the Group would
                                investigate the question of “whether economic programs are being
                                pushed as vigorously as others” and urged that “economic personnel
                                should be included in survey groups for key provinces “ (Department
                                of State, Special Group Counterinsurgency Files: Lot 68 D 451,

                        <p>c. The recent RDF intelligence indicating a <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> radio station inside the Cambodian border (about 10
                            miles) was discussed… . [The Honolulu meeting discussed the question of
                            improving DF capability and accuracy in detail; the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are now using a onetime tape that will be
                            unbreakable so there is a need for pinpoint locating information to
                            destroy rather than monitor military communication facilities.]</p>
                        <p>d. State asked Defense for suggestions to soften the impact of 900 <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> personnel scheduled to arrive in
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> in March. [The heavy input is
                            due in part to the Bragg schooling; the first course completes in late
                            March.]</p>
                        <p>e. The proposed arrangement to handle the U.S. news representatives in
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> was agreed in Honolulu (the
                            Ambassador will make final decision on newsmen going on U.S. helos and
                            aircraft with Country Team advice; in any case where General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> says they are not to go,

                            flexibility needed at local level in handling of American newsmen
                            covering Viet-Nam operations. We conclude that in absence of rigid
                            censorship, US interests best be protected through policy of maximum
                            feasible cooperation, guidance and appeal to good faith of
                            correspondents.</p>

                        <p>Recent press and magazine reports are convincing evidence that
                            speculation stories by hostile reporters often more damaging than facts
                            they might report.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador has over-all authority for handling of newsmen, in so far as
                            US is concerned. He will make decisions as to when newsmen permitted to
                            go on any missions with US personnel, when approved by US military
                                commander.<note n="3" xml:id="d75fn3">The draft message did not
                                include this last clause.</note> They also must approve in advance
                            transport of newsmen on US ships and other US craft, including air,
                            involved in Viet-Nam operations.<note n="4" xml:id="d75fn4">At this
                                point in the draft message was the sentence: “Ambassador to be
                                guided by advice of Task Force Saigon members, particularly General
                                    <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>.”</note>
                            Ambassador should coordinate the information policy with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> if possible.</p>
                        <p>Attention called to the following guidelines which we believe in our
                            national interest. US military and civilian personnel must see that they
                            are adhered to scrupulously and that Ambassador given complete
                            cooperation if we to avoid harmful press repercussions on both domestic
                            and international scene.</p>
                        <p>1. This is not a US war. US personnel, civilian or military, should not
                            grant interviews or take other actions implying all-out US involvement.
                            Important that we constantly reinforce idea that this is struggle in
                            which tens of thousands Vietnamese fighting for their freedom, and that
                            our participation is only in training, advisory and support phases.</p>
                        <p>2. We recognize it natural that American newsmen will concentrate on
                            activities of Americans. It not in our interest, however, to have
                            stories indicating that Americans are leading and directing combat
                            missions against the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>3. Should impress upon newsmen that purpose of certain classified
                            operations is to flush out and destroy bands of vicious Viet Cong
                            terrorists. Every effort made to avoid harming innocent civilians.
                            Sensational press stories about children or civilians who become
                            unfortunate victims of military operations are clearly inimical to
                            national interest.</p>
                        <p>4. Operations may be referred to in general terms, but specific
                            numbers—particularly numbers of Americans involved—and details of
                            material introduced are not to be provided. On tactical security
                            matters, analysis strength and weaknesses and other operational details
                            which might aid enemy should be avoided.</p>
                        <p>5. We cannot avoid all criticism of <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>. No effort should be made to “forbid” such
                            articles. Believe, however, that if newsmen feel we are cooperating they
                            will be more receptive to explanation that we in a vicious struggle
                            where support of South Vietnamese is crucial and that articles that tear
                            down <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> only make our task more
                            difficult.</p>
                        <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0180"/>
                        <p>6. Emphasize to newsmen fact that success of operation requires high
                            level <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>-American cooperation and that
                            frivolous, thoughtless criticism of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            makes cooperation difficult achieve.</p>
                        <p>7. Correspondents should not be taken on missions whose nature such that
                            undesirable dispatches would be highly probable.</p>
                        <p>Think it advisable that Ambassador and General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> see newsmen at frequent
                            intervals so as to establish point that they keeping press informed to
                            extent compatible with security. Should consider pre-operations briefing
                            of newsmen by designated spokesman.</p>
                        <p>The point below for consideration and private use at Ambassador's
                            discretion:</p>
                        <p>It should be possible for Ambassador and/or military to exact from
                            responsible correspondents voluntary undertakings to avoid emphasis in
                            dispatches of sensitive matters, to check doubtful facts with US
                            Government authorities on scene. Seriousness of need for this may be
                            duly impressed on responsible correspondents to extent that, in
                            interests of national security and their own professional needs, they
                            can be persuaded to adopt self-policing machinery. Can be reminded that
                            in World War II American press voluntarily accepted broad and effective
                            censorship. In type struggle now going on in Viet-Nam such
                            self-restraint by press no less important. Important to impress on
                            newsmen that at best this is long term struggle in which most important
                            developments may be least sensational and in which “decisive battles”

                        <p>Dear Cot: While Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> was here<note n="2" xml:id="d77fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> was in Honolulu on
                                February 19 for the Secretary of Defense's Conference.</note> he
                            raised two subjects with me in a brief, private conversation, stressing
                            the importance of my taking the right line on them. This conversation
                            took place during the morning break, and although at lunch time Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> said he wanted to
                            have another word with me before he left, the opportunity for one never
                            arose. The purpose of this letter is to find out just what the
                            Department's thinking is on these subjects.</p>
                        <p>The first subject is Jungle Jim operations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> expressed concern about the
                            inadequacy of information as to targets with the consequent danger that
                            innocent people would be killed. He emphasized that such operations
                            should not be conducted in such a way as to alienate the Vietnamese
                            people from the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and the United
                            States. He had no objection to close support of ground operations but
                            was worried about other types of air strikes.</p>
                        <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162" facs="0182"/>
                        <p>I told him that I had had a letter from you<note n="3" xml:id="d77fn3">Not further identified.</note> expressing much the same concern and
                            had discussed it with Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName>. I pointed out that targets were selected in
                            Viet-Nam on the basis of recommendations by the Vietnamese, and I
                            thought that everyone here was conscious of the great importance of
                            hitting the right targets.</p>
                        <p>My conversation with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>
                            took place before discussion of Agenda Item 5 on the subject of the
                            problem of target selection and identification, including “action to
                            minimize casualties and damage of friendly assets by air operations”.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_ABGRH1">Anthis</persName> briefed on
                            this subject very thoroughly. He acknowledged that all target
                            information came from the Vietnamese and that the United States could
                            not determine as a fact the validity of target information. However, the
                                <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> did not accept any missions
                            which the VNAF could perform and took every precaution to screen the
                            Vietnamese requests which came to it. General <persName corresp="#p_ABGRH1">Anthis</persName> had imposed the
                            restriction on Jungle Jim operations not to operate less than five miles
                            from the Lao and Cambodian borders during the daytime and ten miles at
                            night.</p>
                        <p>Following General <persName corresp="#p_ABGRH1">Anthis</persName>'
                            briefing Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> asked how a
                            decision was made in individual cases as to whether military advantage
                            outweighs political disadvantage. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> replied that he was convinced
                            that the greatest care has been exercised to insure that wrong targets
                            are not hit although we have to rely completely on Vietnamese
                            intelligence at present. Our post-strike information, however, is
                            virtually nil. He felt we should try to squeeze out more post-strike
                            information and, as our own intelligence capabilities increase, to
                            double check <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> intelligence.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said as he saw
                            it there should be three primary restrictions on <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> operations: 1. Minimize risk of loss
                            of US personnel; 2. Avoid trespassing beyond South Viet-Nam's borders;
                            and, 3. Conduct operations only when there is a net advantage.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> pointed out
                            (without contradiction) that the surest operations were those of close
                            ground support while interdiction strikes were less safe. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> then said that as he
                            understood it General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>
                            and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> would
                            have to decide in each case the question of the net advantage of an air
                            strike since the necessary information was not available in
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of the foregoing discussion, I had the feeling (although I
                            was unable to confirm it) that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> was satisfied that the responsible people in
                            Viet-Nam, both on the Embassy and military side, are now doing their
                            best to insure that United States air operations are conducted in such a
                            way as to minimize political disadvantages and that day-to-day controls
                            on such operations must be maintained<pb n="163" xml:id="pg_163" facs="0183"/> as a practical matter in Viet-Nam rather than in
                            Washington or Honolulu. If this is incorrect, or if you have further
                            thoughts on this subject, please let me know.</p>
                        <p>The other subject which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> discussed with me was the defoliant operation.
                            We had just had a briefing on defoliants and it was apparent that the
                            technical information available on the results was inadequate and that
                            management of the whole project had been somewhat confused by the
                            autonomous workings of the R and D people. It also came out that the
                            Communists were making propaganda out of the use of defoliants, as was
                            to be expected.</p>
                        <p>Based on the communications I have seen from the Department on the
                            subject of defoliants, there has been no conflict in view between this
                            headquarters and the Department on this subject. <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> has never been enthusiastic
                            about the project and was firmly opposed to the spraying of crops, fully
                            realizing the political and propaganda hazards. The push behind the
                            project has come from the Vietnamese themselves and the R and D people.
                            As you know the subject has been discussed at both the previous <gloss target="#t_SecDef1">SecDef</gloss> conferences and approval given
                            for only limited spraying in order to determine the operational
                            usefulness of defoliants under various conditions. To the best of my
                            knowledge what has been done so far on defoliants has been concurred in
                            by the Department. If there is going to be a change in the Department's
                            thinking on this subject, I hope you will let me know.</p>
                        <p>Since I expect to leave with Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> on February 28 for a brief trip to Southeast Asia,
                            you may not be able to reply to this letter in time to reach me in
                            Honolulu. However, if there is some guidance which would be useful for
                            me to have on these subjects prior to our visit to Saigon March 6-8,
                            perhaps you could send your reply to me there in care of the Embassy,
                            sending a copy to Tom here. I am, of course, at all times glad to
                            receive guidance on such subjects as this from you and others in <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> at any time that you feel there is need
                            for it.</p>
                        <p>Thank you for sending personal regards via Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>. I reciprocate them

                        <p>On February 21, 1962, the intelligence community issued Special National
                            Intelligence Estimate 10-62, “Communist Objectives, Capabilities and
                            Intentions in Southeast Asia.” (Department of State, <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss> Files: Lot 69 D 121, Southeast Asia.) It
                            concluded (1) that the Communist bloc had maintained basic unity in
                            tactics toward Southeast Asia, but a Sino-Soviet split might result in a
                            more militant Chinese attitude in the area; (2) that large-scale
                            military actions by Chinese or North Vietnam was unlikely; (3) that
                            there was no timetable or priority listing that the Communist forces
                            were following in the area; and (4) that Thailand was a prime candidate
                            for subversion.</p>
                        <p>One paragraph dealt with South Vietnam; it reads:</p>
                        <p>“In South Vietnam, we believe that there will be no significant change
                            over the short run in the current pattern of Viet Cong activity,
                            although the scope and tempo of the Communist military and political
                            campaigns will probably be increased. The Viet Cong will probably again
                            resort to large-scale attacks, seeking to dramatize the weakness of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> forces and to reduce
                            both civilian and military morale, in an effort to bring about <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s downfall under circumstances
                            which could be exploited to Communist advantage.”</p>

                        <p>Dear Mr. Vice President: One of the nicest things said to me since my
                            arrival here as Chief, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, was your
                            remark, “I'm glad we have you fighting for us out here.” Because of
                            this, I feel as a fellow westerner, you will understand the following
                            remarks and my feelings, both personal and professional, about fast
                            moving events here. First of all, I am most happy that the wonderful
                            impact made by your trip, and its dynamic pro-American effect on the
                            Vietnamese people, has not been allowed to lag-that we are delivering on
                            the promises and maintaining the image. Second, I get the distinct
                            impression that since your visit and the advent of Vietnam on the
                            forefront of the world stage, we have tended to be too pessimistic about
                            the situation <pb n="165" xml:id="pg_165" facs="0185"/>here. It is still
                            critical but certainly not hopeless. Third, that other of our top people
                            now understand what you learned last May-that there is a hot war going
                            on here for which neither <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> nor our
                            country was geared.</p>
                        <p>This latter which I reported 17 months ago, was the key to my past
                            problems here until your understanding began to change the climate of
                            opinion at the policy and decision making levels. As you will recall, an
                            already complex situation was made even more difficult by the military
                            and political ideas on Vietnam which prevailed at that time. <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> was trying to pull them together into
                            a coordinated effort. However, along the way, the admittedly attractive
                            idea of quick and spectacular military victories instead of the
                            historically sound sustained longer range approach got the upper hand.
                            Although this was contrary to <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>'s
                            considered judgment, we naturally attempted to carry it out—even to the
                            point of it becoming counterproductive with <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>I was most happy that the Secretary of Defense after hearing my ideas on
                            this, which coincided with <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s
                            opinions, put this idea on the back burner. Time, of course, is the
                            controlling factor for the work of the “Civic Action-Rural
                            Reconstruction” teams in laying the absolutely necessary infrastructure
                            at village and hamlet level which will allow <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to eventually separate the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> from the people. Such a control framework, plus adequate
                            force which is now on the way, will permit the development of badly
                            needed operational intelligence, plus an understanding on the part of
                            the people through assuring their better protection. These basic
                            elements, with adequate training of sufficient military forces is the
                            crux of the Pacification Problem toward which <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>'s advisory effort has been oriented since my
                            arrival.</p>
                        <p>The announcement of the new Command, USCOMACV, has had a good
                            psychological effect on <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>. However, in providing <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> the tools to do the job, we must not
                            offer so much that they forget that the job of saving their country is
                            theirs—only they can do it. In addition, the political, economic and
                            psychological fields must march abreast of the military effort as a
                            coordinated whole. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> is working hard on this.</p>
                        <p>On the military side, while <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>
                            still runs a highly centralized operation, significant progress has been
                            made in the military—although his tendency to run the military show
                            still persists. This will take strong coordinating political assistance
                            in complementing areas. Training has been expedited and improved but, in
                            my professional opinion, it has been cut to buy time until it is now
                            barely marginal and cannot be further reduced. In addition, it is still
                            difficult to get commanders and politicians here to think and act
                            unconventionally. As our enemy is tough, dedicated and trained—we also
                            must be if we are to win.</p>
                        <pb n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0186"/>
                        <p>I feel the new command will find that a firm base has been built here for
                            continued progress as an Area Command—the operational type work the
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> staff has been hard pressed to
                            do here since 1959. This new headquarters should now allow the slowly
                            increasing staff and command increment which remains with <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> as a subordinate headquarters, a
                            chance to do a better Training-<gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>-job.
                            With the hot war situation, this training job must be especially done
                            well and it must, of necessity, get into the field of daily small unit
                            operational planning. The breakdown of functions and responsibilities
                            between the two headquarters is progressing smoothly and will, no doubt,
                            take this into consideration.</p>
                        <p>Naturally, due to the rapid build up of recently authorized <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Advisors, we are experiencing some
                            “growing pains” in arranging for their logistical support and insuring
                            their prompt assignment to the most productive advisory slots. Of
                            course, we will continue to experience certain frustrations inherent in
                            this wartime situation wherein we have no command authority vis-à-vis
                            our counterparts. However, I feel we are continuing to make
                            progress.</p>
                        <p>With the formation of a senior headquarters, I particularly wanted you to
                            know the terrific job the people working under me have done—under
                            complex and difficult conditions. I can truly report that we have not
                            let you down with respect to your praise of last May. With the growing
                            understanding of the complex situation here and the psychological effect
                            of our country's strong stand announced to the world—followed through
                            with actions—I am more sure than ever that we will win! Of course,
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> will continue to work as a
                            part of the new team towards this end. Harryette, my boss from “Six
                            Shooter Junction,” Hemsted, sends her very best to you and your good
                            Lady, as does her sister-in-law, Amanda Amsler of Houston. You can be
                            sure we will keep pushing!</p>

                        <p>On February 22, 1962, Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> presented an address at Davidson College in
                            Davidson, North Carolina, in which he spoke of United States interests
                            in South Vietnam. He stated that “the United States has no national
                            requirements in that area.” Rather, he said, United States interests lay
                            in preventing external aggression from the north from succeeding. For

                                printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. In appraising the situation in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> we
                            must proceed from three basic facts: first, the communists are presently
                            forcing us to fight on their terms. Second, by its non-conventional
                            nature this form of warfare is designed to be prolonged so as to
                            militarily/politically sap <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> strength.
                            Third, enemy is extremely elusive and operates by methods designed to
                            place conventional military elements at disadvantage where the power of
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s more modern armaments/force
                            are often negated to significant extent.</p>
                        <p>2. Proceeding then from these facts, I equate situation as follows. As
                            regards <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> relative strength vis-à-vis
                            Viet Cong, the current situation, although showing a temporary
                            diminution in <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> activity, does not
                            portend any significant lessening of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            capabilities. Following is submitted in support of this statement.</p>
                        <p>a. Main <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> military body has not been
                            defeated; conversely, it is numerically stronger than ever before, and
                            militarily/politically the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> is very
                            active.</p>
                        <pb n="168" xml:id="pg_168" facs="0188"/>
                        <p>b. Viet Cong still possess their various base areas and exert control
                            over generally same territorial extent as 1961.</p>
                        <p>c. Routes of infiltrations from <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> are
                            still open to <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> through Laos and support
                            is still coming over these routes.</p>
                        <p>d. Militarily, <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> can attack at will, move
                            swiftly, and has an offensive posture, whereas many <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> ground force elements are, by
                            circumstances, forced into sedentary-fixed defenses, and, where <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces undertake offensive they
                            handicapped by <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> elusiveness. Further,
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces handicapped by inadequate
                            timely intelligence on</p>
                        <p>e. Will, determination, and fighting ability of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> is at least equal to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. Until only recently, the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            were far in the lead in offensive/aggressive posture, thus engendering
                            more hope/confidence in rank and file.</p>
                        <p>f. Politically <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> has support of a
                            significant segment of rural population; politically, time appears on
                            the side of Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>g. Lastly, length and nature of the conflict combine to breed
                            circumstances wherein an anti-government coup could be launched, but
                            conversely, no anti-communist coup is likely to topple Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>3. In respect to our strength position throughout country, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> military strength is comparatively
                            uniform but <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s political strength is
                            not. Generally the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s political
                            conbro1 is greatest in the major urban areas and along coastal plain
                            where good routes of communication exist. On other hand, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> control is virtually nonexistent in
                            Phuoc Thanh province which is largely encompassed by Viet Cong's
                            stronghold of war Zone D. Viet Cong are also dominant in much of the Ca
                            Mau Peninsula swamp area and in much of high plateau area along the Laos
                            border—both regions where terrain/lack of roads tend to restrict
                            movement of conventional forces. A program of province surveys is
                            underway. Reports on first two provinces surveyed (Tay Ninh and Binh
                            Long) illustrate variance of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            strength in different areas. In Tay Ninh of 56 villages, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has some control of 33, and full
                            control in only 12 of these. In Binh Long province, however, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has full political conbro1 of 14 of 15
                            ethnic Vietnamese villages and partial control of the 16 Montagnard
                            villages.</p>
                        <p>4. In regard to enemy and friendly activities, <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> have expanded political activity while maintaining their
                            previous pattern of military activity. <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            have established a new party: South Vietnam People's Revolutionary
                            Party. Also, Southern Liberation Front has established number of
                            subsidiary fronts designed to establish a firm hold on <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> by organizing each segment of society
                            in <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> support. New propaganda station has
                            begun broadcasting to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> in five
                            languages. <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are concentrating on
                            getting firm grass roots support.</p>
                        <p>a. That <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> will attempt to establish a
                            liberated area in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> is indicated by
                            above political developments. Advantages of establishment of liberation
                            govt are manifold as witnessed by Laos example in which KL/PL gained
                            diplomatic recognition and considerable bloc <pb n="169" xml:id="pg_169" facs="0189"/>material support after establishing stronghold in PDJ.
                            With US-backed <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> actions becoming more
                            effective against <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, communists probably
                            feel forced to respond.</p>
                        <p>b. On the military side, <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> pattern is
                            largely a continuation of the small unit actions: ambushes of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces, mining of roads, destruction of
                            ground lines of communications, and attacks of small <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> units, particularly <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>
                            installations. <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> dedicated to
                            destruction of <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> which are a basic threat to <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> as military means of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            to separate <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> from people. <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> have capability of concentrating forces
                            to achieve local numerical superiority over <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces in any local area. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> avoids standup battles with <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>. While <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> have
                            successfully evaded most of <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>
                            larger scale operations, existence of <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> forces in vicinity of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> infested areas has probably prevented large scale <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> operations. With new training and weapons
                            being provided <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> forces, they stand to possibly cause
                            increasing damage to <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> hold on certain
                            areas. <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> casualties suffered from <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>, and
                                <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> about evenly divided, one
                            third from each.</p>
                        <p>c. Considerable civil activity will be required to take bulk of basically
                            neutral villages firmly into <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> camp.
                            More Civic Action Teams are needed. These, together with implementation
                            of strategic hamlet plan should be a proper complement to improved
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> military posture.</p>
                        <p>d. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> military operations have increased
                            numerically—28 January there were 232 operations involving forces <gloss target="#t_BN1">BN</gloss> size or larger. Real war of attrition,
                            however, being fought by <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> platoons/companies. These operations
                            are responsible for killing most of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>.
                            When these forces encounter any strong <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            concentrations they have responsive backing by <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> which increasingly aggressive and exploiting their
                            new air mobility.</p>
                        <p>5. In regard to future <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> military
                            activity.</p>
                        <p>a. In coming months is expected generally to follow past pattern/
                            tactics. We may anticipate continuation of large numbers of low-level
                            incidents with occasional attack in <gloss target="#t_BN1">BN</gloss>
                            strength. Expect more <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> emphasis to put
                            on organization/training to further develop larger tactical units. Also,
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> may obtain better weapons for use
                            against helicopters/low flying aircraft. <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> will endeavor to sabotage aircraft, and improve their
                            intelligence and defensive means of obtaining warning re air/ground
                            attacks. <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> will try to retain present
                            numerical strength thru local recruitment plus infiltration. Concerted
                            attempts will be made to capture as well as infiltrate arms.</p>
                        <p>b. Politically <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> will stress themes of:
                            US military intervention, US interference in internal affairs, use of
                            defoliants, and presence of US aircraft. National Liberation Front will
                            continue to expand its activities by setting up Red organizations to
                            reach/supervise people. There will be greater emphasis on political
                            efforts in cities as well as countryside, with continuous effort to gain
                            populace's support, and to recruit, <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            may even make a dramatic appeal for world support for any so called
                            liberation government.</p>
                        <p>6. In regard to specific questions posed by your para 2, ref d, following
                            submitted:</p>
                        <pb n="170" xml:id="pg_170" facs="0190"/>
                        <p>a. <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> strength is estimated at 20,000 to
                            25,000. This is a net increase of at least 2,000 from our Dec 61
                            estimate of nearly 18,000. Believe that at least half this increase due
                            to active recruiting, with remainder infiltrated largely overland.</p>
                        <p>b. Review of casualties/incident statistics over past year indicates that
                            the 3rd Corps area has been most active in both categories. The 2nd and
                            1st Corps zones, however, have shown a broadening of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> initiated incidents since last summer.
                            Noteworthy in analysis of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> casualties
                            during the last six months of 1961 is that while losses in the regular
                            armed forces remained generally constant, there was a significant rise
                            in <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> losses. In fact they have
                            sustained greatest number of losses each month since Oct.</p>
                        <p>c. Incidents run the gamut of armed attacks, acts of terrorism, sabotage,
                            and propaganda. Criteria has been constant for past two years.</p>
                        <p>d. The increase in number of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> initiated
                            incidents and in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> casualties must be
                            attributed to the buildup of both <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> forces, and to a lesser extent to
                            the expanding of <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> operations. To
                            some extent, increased number and scope of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> military operations apparently induces temporary
                            increased retaliatory <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> incidents
                            probably as a psychological tactic. Viet Cong's high incident rate in
                            3rd Corps remained generally constant while total of incidents went up
                            as <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> strength increase permitted a
                            spread of operations into other two corps zones. <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> losses have increased substantially each month and
                            almost doubled from June 1961 to January 1962. Acting to destroy <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> forces <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> have caused a deadly conflict increasing losses on both
                            sides. As <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> have increased
                            operational tempo they have increased their troops' exposure to steady
                            minor losses from snipers/ ambushes.</p>
                        <p>e. Better reporting methods have been developed over past few months, but
                            this has not necessarily caused increase in events reported upon.</p>
                        <p>7. In overall summary, <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are feeling
                            results of improvement of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> military
                            posture, but they have not suffered major setbacks or loss of territory.
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> plan a prolonged form of
                            athritiona1 warfare. <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> cannot be
                            defeated by purely military means. They will not yet stand and fight in
                            open. Until they change from subterranean tactics, they cannot be
                            routed/defeated solely by bayonet. While military superiority is a
                            prerequisite to solution final success will come only when people can be
                            alienated away from Viet Cong and given adequate
                            protection/security.</p>

                        <p>It is my judgment that you will be in a stronger personal position in

                            South Viet-Nam that can be provided by air units based in Thailand will
                            depend greatly on whether overflight of Laos is authorized.</p>

                            However, plans must be sufficiently flexible to allow for a changing

                        <p>3. The plan recognizes the current situation and in that respect is more
                            suitable to the problem than Plan 5 is in Laos. It ignores Cambodia
                            except inferentially by reference to lines of communication in Laos
                            (which could be used to reach Cambodia, then into <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>). The question of action against NVN,
                            in any form, if external support of insurgency in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> continues, is not faced, though the
                            possibility of escalation is. It is psychologically sound to include the
                            deployment of Plan 7 forces to Thailand in addition to the increased
                            readiness gained thereby to meet broader intervention.</p>

                                the war in Vietnam. (Ibid., 751K.00/2-2462)</note> are as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>(1) As in Laos, can assume Moscow wishes avoid enlargement of hostilities
                            into international conflict which would heighten risk of major war. In
                            this sense Vietnam not vital Soviet interest. However, if balance should
                            tip in South Vietnam's favor, Soviets might feel obliged to re-dress
                            balance through greater support of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>:
                            1) to meet threat to <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> itself, and 2)
                            to prevent Chinese from coming in large way.</p>
                        <p>(2) Although Moscow likely prefer peaceful resolution of Vietnam problem,
                            it cannot afford to appear soft regarding expansion of communism in
                            colonial areas, if for no other reason than this would seem to confirm
                            Chinese arguments in ideological dispute. Likely Moscow approach would
                            be to use growing tension over Vietnam as pressure to convene
                            international conference in 1954 Geneva framework.</p>
                        <p>(3) In past Soviets may have been confident that South Vietnam would fall
                            to Communists sooner or later, but vigorous and effective US support for
                            South Vietnam would change situation, especially if latter became strong
                            enough to expand military operations into <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb n="175" xml:id="pg_175" facs="0195"/>
                        <p>(4) a. Establishment of “liberated” area and “government” in South
                            Vietnam would not necessarily pose dilemma for Soviets, although likely
                            that they would oppose these moves until possibility of reactivating
                            international machinery explored further. Moscow for example has not
                            recognized <gloss target="#t_FLN1">FLN</gloss> de jure, although it
                            supports latter materially and with propaganda.</p>
                        <p>b. Do not believe Soviets so much concerned over revelation of split with
                            Chinese as they are with preserving their influence in <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. Possible that Soviets will promise
                            logistic support to <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to preempt
                            Chinese intervention as they did in Laos.</p>
                        <p>Vukolic's point regarding “influential groups” in USSR strikes us as
                            typically Yugoslav. Do not believe there is serious division of opinion
                            here regarding Vietnam and all major elements of regime, including
                            military, likely be opposed to escalation there.</p>
                        <p>Soviet press has not indicated what purpose is of Ponomaryev mission
                            currently in <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. Presumably this
                            related to Soviet-Chinese ideological dispute, but it could also be
                            engaged in seeking <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> agreement to
                            cautious policy in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Soviet policy toward Vietnam will be very much influenced by outcome in
                            Laos as well as by developments in other major East-West problems such
                            as disarmament and Berlin. In many respects Soviet policy appears to be
                            approaching a crossroads and developments in any one of these problems
                            could well affect general course of Soviet policy toward West as well as
                            toward Commie China. Whatever Soviet longer-range policy on Vietnam
                            question may be I am convinced that for present they would prefer avoid
                            any decisive actions there.</p>

                        <p>After your approval, I accepted the invitation by Charlie Murphy to meet
                            with the editors of <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> magazine for an
                            off-the-record discussion on Vietnam. We had a two hour talk at lunch in
                            New York last Friday, 23 February. I spent several more hours with the
                            writers and photographers who are working on <hi rend="italic">Life's</hi> coverage of Vietnam. Charlie Murphy, who arranged this
                            and accompanied me, was most constructive in his comments and
                            questions.</p>
                        <p>Essentially, the editors (George Hunt, Hugh Moffatt, Joe Kessner, etc.)
                            seemed to be sincerely trying to make up their minds on whether or not
                            the U.S. is wise in supporting <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Ngo Dinh
                                Diem</persName> in Vietnam. “Can we win with him?” “Should a coup
                            replace him?”</p>
                        <p>The questions apparently were raised by a series of letters from <hi rend="italic">Time-Life</hi> correspondents, sparked to some extent
                            by Stan Karnow of the Hong Kong office who is violently opposed to
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>. Karnow is the man who
                            was opposed to our aid in Laos and, earlier, our aid to Chiang against
                            Mao; he has a low opinion of <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>, <hi rend="italic">McGarr</hi>, and <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName>. Anyhow, as a result, <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> editor <hi rend="italic">Roy Alexander</hi>
                            has gone to Vietnam for a first-hand look, to help advise on <hi rend="italic">Life's</hi> editorial policy re <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <pb n="177" xml:id="pg_177" facs="0197"/>
                        <p>I gave them several different angles for consideration. Since there seems
                            to be a stepped-up campaign <hi rend="italic">Newsweek</hi>, <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>, and certain parts of Washington)
                            to denigrate the President's decision to support Vietnam and <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s government, some of my remarks
                            may be of help to you. I note the highlights below, along with some of
                            the questions asked.</p>
                        <p>At the start, I remarked that they—and other Americans—were trying to
                            play God, by trying to pick a leader for Vietnam. If they were serious,
                            as they seemed to be, then they needed a yardstick to measure up
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> and other Vietnamese, to
                            compare them for the job. I had some suggested measurements which
                            Americans might use:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Dedication to defeat the enemy.</hi> Since Vietnam
                            is essentially in a life-or-death struggle, the leader on our side must
                            be every bit as dedicated to victory as Ho Chi Minh is on the Communist
                            side.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Executive ability.</hi> The leader must have the
                            ability to keep his government running, in many complex fields, despite
                            the lack of competent or experienced Vietnamese administrators.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Moral courage</hi>. In a war, such as Vietnam's,
                            there are many tough decisions that have to be made. None ever seem to
                            be “black and white” problems, but mostly fuzzy gray ones which take
                            real moral courage to decide.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Constitutionality.</hi> Since Vietnam has gone
                            through real birth pangs in becoming a nation, we must consider the
                            value of the legality of the Presidency. The Vietnamese had elected an
                            Assembly to write a Constitution in 1956, had voted for this
                            Constitution which established a government for the people, including a
                            President, Vice President, and an Assembly, and had voted in the
                            Presidential election of 1961 for President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> and Vice President <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName>. Do we want to make that Constitution a scrap of
                            paper or a viable legal document?</p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Integrity</hi>. We should want a Vietnamese leader
                            who has deep honesty, a selfless dedication to the cause, a man who
                            won't use U.S. aid for his own selfish ends. Even those who hate
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> admit he is
                            puritanically honest.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Team leader.</hi>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> is weak in delegating
                            authority and in getting the whole Vietnamese team to follow him
                            whole-heartedly. But, have we really thought about why? U.S. officials
                            have insisted that <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> give
                            authority to civil and military officials who are weak, if not disloyal;
                            a number of our own Presidents have had similar problems and we might
                            well show a little more constructive understanding by helping him solve
                            this problem rather than force him to compound it.</p>
                        <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Popularity</hi>. The leader of the free Vietnamese
                            must vie in popularity with the leader of the slave Vietnamese, Ho Chi
                            Minh. <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> is the best known free
                            Vietnamese. Making him the best liked is simply a professional chore,
                            with some help from <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>; the
                            chore is neither one for Madison Avenue techniques nor Communist
                            techniques. It <pb n="178" xml:id="pg_178" facs="0198"/>was done in
                            1954-56, and could be done again, if necessary. As a corollary, it is
                            noted that intellectuals who are most critical of <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> do not speak of love or affection
                            for and by the people. Intellectuals instinctively mistrust the people,
                            with their belief of superiority of intellect needing to be kept
                            unsullied by trust of others. This snobbery or arrogance is amusing but
                            empty when it turns to being critical of a person for not being
                            popular.</p>
                        <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Liberal? Conservative?</hi> Some of the criticism of
                            the Vietnamese government and of <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> is based on unusually fuzzy thinking for this day
                            and age. Much of the political reform measures we insist that <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> adopt need to be looked at in the
                            harsh light of the violent combat in Vietnam. An honest, hard look will
                            reveal that they are “gimmicks” with much the same flavor as
                            “deforestation”; the political gimmicks are pushed forward with much the
                            same do-good enthusiasm as military and economic gimmicks. We should be
                            desiring a Churchill, not a Chamberlain, for these critical moments in
                            Vietnam. Some reforms are needed, but we must help <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> and the Vietnamese towards
                            practical ways of solving their problems, not just sit on the sidelines
                            and give orders for actions which are not solutions.</p>
                        <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Know the needs of people and country.</hi> There are
                            a number of politicians in Vietnam who aspire to be the top leader. In
                            talking with a number of them, including some who are friends of mine, I
                            know of none who has the depth of understanding his people and country
                            which is needed for leadership now. Some are sincere patriots whom I
                            would like to see growing politically today by holding positions of
                            public trust. Others only seek to satisfy narrow aims or their
                            vanity.</p>
                        <p>A rather lively discussion took place after this description of a
                            suggested “yardstick.” It continued after the editors left and when
                            Scott Levitt (writer), Howard Sochurek (photographer), and I discussed
                            the articles the two of them will prepare. Some of the questions asked
                            in both sessions stick in my mind, and I am noting them below, as of
                            interest to you:</p>
                        <p>Q.: What makes you think Americans should “play God,” as you put it?</p>
                        <p>A.: I was merely putting the correct label to what you, and other
                            Americans, seem to be up to today. You wonder if we can win with
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> or be better off with a
                            coup and a possible military leader in Vietnam. President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> has pledged U.S. support to
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>, and we are matching
                            that pledge with a series of actions. Now you express doubt that this is
                            what we should do. You hint that there are alternatives. When I suggest
                            that these alternatives be taken out in the daylight and measured, it
                            should cause no surprise. It is obvious that you, as responsible
                            editors, are doing much the same as we are doing in Washington—acting as
                            Americans for the best good of our country and trying to think very hard
                            before we take each decision.</p>
                        <pb n="179" xml:id="pg_179" facs="0199"/>
                        <p>Q.: Does President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> really
                            want to win in Vietnam? Isn't there some hedging on this desire when
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> says it will
                            take 5 to 6 years?</p>
                        <p>A.: I feel that the Administration has made it very plain that the U.S.
                            is determined to help the Vietnamese win their struggle for freedom. The
                            President has said so in plain terms, not only to the U.S., but to the
                            Vietnamese and the world. Secretary <hi rend="italic">McNamara</hi> and
                            Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName>, along
                            with General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName>, are
                            taking many actions to make our military aid and advisors really help
                            the Vietnamese. To those who hope for a quick, cheap, and easy victory,
                            the top folks in the Pentagon are saying honestly that this looks like a
                            tough job that is going to take some doing.</p>
                        <p>Q.: Why was General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>
                            appointed? Did Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> think he needed more rank in the U.S. military?
                            Can a conventional soldier win this kind of a war?</p>
                        <p>A.: General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> was picked
                            as the military man who could best use U.S. military resources to help
                            the Vietnamese win. He has just arrived. Why not wait and see how he
                            does?</p>
                        <p>Q.: Why don't we get rid of people like <persName corresp="#p_GAZ1">Gardiner</persName> in <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> in <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>? They aren't getting anywhere with
                            the Vietnamese and aren't helping anybody win.</p>
                        <p>A.: This question is in the category of “why don't you stop beating your
                            wife.” Any answer I give damns me. However, it should be obvious that
                            someone in authority has placed them in Vietnam and believes they are
                            serving usefully.</p>
                        <p>Q.: Why do we have the big “paper-mill” <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> in Saigon? Why so many U.S. military at desks and not
                            out in the field?</p>
                        <p>A.: This is much the same category of question as the previous one.
                            Taking these questions, and your earlier ones on <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>, it seems that you and too many
                            other Americans, including both military and civil officials in
                            Washington and Saigon, simply fail to realize the facts of today's war.
                            Our side is under deadly attack. It is life-or-death today in Vietnam,
                            tomorrow elsewhere. The American people should be awake to this
                            condition of war—and grimly determine that anything short of victory is
                            too little. Since part of the deadly attack today includes the art of
                            tranquilizing Americans at the same time, all of us—including <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> reporters—who have seen the face of this
                            enemy in the attack should bring it home to other Americans. In combat,
                            we remove the commander when his unit fails to take the objective. If we
                            saw today's struggle as combat, we would do the same—whether the
                            commander was an ambassador, an economist, an information man, or a
                            military man. You know how our press would scream about the relief of
                            “good guys” from devoted service to their country in some <pb n="180" xml:id="pg_180" facs="0200"/>hardship post abroad. Well, we still
                            have some toughening up to do, to relegate the “nice people” to our
                            social life and start asking only if the man we put in is winning or
                            not, the way we want him to.</p>
                        <p>Q.: Yes, but don't you think the American people deserve to know all that
                            is going on in Vietnam? After all, some Americans are being killed
                            there, and it is likely that more will be, with the big build-up of our
                            forces there.</p>
                        <p>A.: Certainly I agree that Americans must have the truth, every bit of it
                            that won't help the enemy defeat us. But, isn't it time that you started
                            doing this constructively—rather than treating Vietnam as some quaint
                            and strange place, full of peculiar little people, out at the end of
                            nowhere where our good “American boys” don't belong anyhow, and where
                            some Americans are all thumbs in what they're doing? You who have been
                            there say that the Vietnamese are wonderful people, with a deep love of
                            individual liberty. Well, why don't you picture them to the American
                            people that way—as real people not too unlike us, people fighting
                            against tyranny today? Then, as Americans go out to help them in this
                            good fight—as advisors where the shooting is—standing up to be counted
                            right alongside them—the American people can understand why Americans
                            took the risks along with the Vietnamese. Hellsfire, we both love the
                            same concept of freedom, and you know it, and I know it, but you haven't
                            told that to the American people yet. They deserve that truth. And, to
                            encourage the very Americans we need as dedicated volunteers in Vietnam,
                            why don't you give some recognition to our really good guys out there?
                            You've seen them in action, committed right up to the hilt in this
                            struggle. I know that the Vietnamese love this type of American and bust
                            their britches trying to be as good as he thinks they are. Well, we
                            ought to love this type of American, too, and let him know it—to give
                            him the encouragement he richly deserves. We have them in Vietnam today.
                            I think your readers deserve to know about them. If a guy like that
                            becomes a casualty, every American will feel it and not have to wonder
                            what he was doing halfway around the world.</p>

                        <p>1. As of late afternoon Feb. 27 calm continued prevail in Saigon, and
                            morning's attack on Presidential palace appears have been unsuccessful
                            attempt assassinate <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> and Nhus
                            rather than element in coup d'etat.</p>
                        <p>2. Except for two aircraft involved in attack, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> military establishment remained loyal to President and
                            government. All services including air force, responded with alacrity
                            and efficiency to attack. Before 35-minute assault had ended, armor and
                            supporting units had arrived at palace, air force had pursuing AD-6's in
                            air, and navy putting up heavy anti-aircraft barrage.</p>

                        <p>3. One attacking aircraft apparently forced down by ground fire and pilot
                            captured. Second plane crash landed Phnom Penh.</p>
                        <p>4. President told Ambassador only palace casualty was injured maid. Small
                            number troops on or around palace grounds were wounded. Madame
                                <persName corresp="#p_TLX1">Nhu</persName> also suffered slight wound on arm.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NBKBK1">Nehru</persName> made what was
                            essentially a courtesy call on the Secretary immediately prior to his
                            return to India for a fortnight's consultation. After the usual
                            pleasantries, the Secretary raised the subject of Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary reviewed briefly the United States position regarding
                            Vietnam, emphasizing that the US did not wish the trouble in Vietnam to
                            become a serious war. He said that if the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> can find a way of stopping penetrations from the North,
                            the US would work diligently to bring the situation back in line with
                            the Geneva Accords. We recognize the problem posed to the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> by our overt assistance to South
                            Vietnam, but we cannot fail to take account of the reality of the covert
                            violations of the Geneva Accords by the other side.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador indicated that both in New Delhi and in Vietnam itself the
                            Indians had some difficulties because of the extreme visibility of our
                            assistance. The Ambassador, however, repudiated the Secretary's
                            suggestion that perhaps the Indian Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>
                            <pb n="184" xml:id="pg_184" facs="0204"/> would prefer to dose his eyes
                            to violations on both sides. The Secretary then explored the Indian
                            position with regard to the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>'s
                            responsibilities toward investigating subversion. The Ambassador
                            indicated his belief that India held the view that subversion as such
                            was not the concern of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>; it
                            became a matter for the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> only when it
                            could be shown that it came from the outside.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador asked whether there was anything specific the United
                            States wished India to do in Vietnam. He would be glad to convey these
                            desires to New Delhi. The Secretary said what we wished was for the
                                <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> to get at the violations coming
                            from the North if it can do so. Mr. Grant added it was our hope the
                                <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> would not make charges against
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> right now, at least until it
                            answered complaints that have been made against the North.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary wondered whether our side had been getting to the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> all the information we can on these
                            complaints.</p>
                        <p>It was left for Mr. Grant to inform himself on this matter and to have
                            specific information for the Ambassador regarding the type of <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> action the US felt should be taken now.
                            (Mr. Grant talked further to the Ambassador on this subject the
                            following day and left with him the attached paper.)</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>For an extended period of time the Government of the Republic of Vietnam
                            has been providing the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> with evidence
                            that the North Vietnamese regime has been violating the Geneva Accord.
                            Thus on October 24, 1961 the Government of the Republic of Vietnam made
                            an elaborate presentation to the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> of
                            the data available at that time of North Vietnamese-directed subversion
                            in South Vietnam. The presentation was accompanied by the request that
                            the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> investigate. Additional evidence
                            was submitted on November 16, 1961, December 29, 1961 and, most
                            recently, on January 27, 1962. Much of this information was used in the
                            preparation of the “White Paper” prepared by the United States
                            Government entitled “A Threat to the Peace”.<note n="2" xml:id="d90fn2">See <ref target="frus1961-63v01#d315">

                        <p>By its letter of December 9, 1961, to the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>,<note n="3" xml:id="d90fn3">Printed in <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents,
                                    1961</hi>, p. 1056.</note> the Government of the Republic of
                            Vietnam notified the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> that it has
                            requested extraordinary aid from the United States for as long as the
                            North Vietnamese regime pursued its aggression. The United States
                            considers the position of the Government of the Republic of Vietnam
                            stated in that letter to be consonant with international law:
                            non-observance <pb n="185" xml:id="pg_185" facs="0205"/>of a treaty
                            obligation by one party to that treaty justifies comparable
                            non-observance by the other party until the first party is prepared to
                            observe its obligations.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> has not yet taken definitive
                            action on these complaints of the Government of the Republic of Vietnam.
                            This is despite the fact that on June 24, 1961 the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> decided that it has the competence and
                            the duty to investigate complaints under Articles 10,19, 24 and 27 of
                            activities fomented by one party against the other in violation of the
                            Geneva Accord.</p>
                        <p>We recognize India's very difficult role as Chairman of an organization
                            whose members have widely differing views and which has the
                            responsibility of attempting to enforce a cease fire under most
                            difficult circumstances. The actions of the North Vietnam regime are
                            convert actions taken by a closed society. Counter-actions of the
                            Government of the Republic of Vietnam and the support by the United
                            States provided on request are those of open societies acting
                            overtly.</p>
                        <p>The United States hopes that before any citing of the Government of
                            Vietnam the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> would act on the
                            complaints made by the Government of the Republic of Vietnam over the
                            last two years of subversion by North Vietnam. If the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> does cite the Government of the
                            Republic of Vietnam for violating the Geneva Accord, we would expect the
                                <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> at the very least to cite at the
                            same time the North Vietnam regime, since it is the actions of North
                            Vietnam which give rise to the counter-actions of the Government of the
                            Republic of Vietnam.</p>

                        <p>After a warm exchange of greetings, the President told his guests of some
                            of the incidents surrounding the bombing of Independence Palace on 27
                            February 1962. He said that throughout the attack, he had the impression
                            that the explosions were taking place some 20 kilometers away. He
                            described this as a curious phenomenon since, normally, his hearing is
                            very acute—the presence of another person in his room—the striking of a
                            match, usually being enough to awaken him. He cited several examples
                            wherein he had called General Ty or Colonel Mao (who is charged with the
                            security of Saigon) to ask the reason for distant artillery fire or the
                            explosion of a grenade within the city. In many instances, neither of
                            them had heard the noise. In response to a comment by Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> concerning the
                            excellent maps which the President had had in his Independence Palace
                            office, <pb n="188" xml:id="pg_188" facs="0208"/>the President replied
                            that they were now present in his room. A bomb had struck the verandah
                            near his office, but had not exploded. If it had, the stairs leading to
                            the bomb shelter would have been demolished and the President would not
                            have been able to find refuge. The <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> family had
                            also been particularly fortunate in that a bomb which carried away a
                            large section of the palace next to their apartment, had hit the side
                            away from the staircase—thus permitting them to escape to the shelter.
                            The children had already come down to play in the garden and were
                            amongst the first to reach the shelter. The last to arrive was Madame
                                <persName corresp="#p_TLX1">Nhu</persName>, who took the time to dress. She was
                            slightly injured on the face by flying glass, and, in womanly fashion,
                            was worried about being scarred. The President's brother, the Archbishop
                            of Hue, who was visiting the President after attending a meeting at the
                            Vatican, went through the entire attack in a small chapel in the new
                            wing of the palace and emerged uninjured. The President expressed the
                            thought that his brother might have been killed if he had attempted to
                            move, since the surrounding area was riddled, and the blast had been
                            violent enough to hurl a heavy brass incense burner the length of the
                            corridor. He added that the Archbishop was the one who had caused the
                            least trouble.</p>
                        <p>The President next told of his visit to the Bien Hoa Airfield (on 28
                            February) during which he personally questioned the Base Commander, the
                            Fighter-Group Commander and other responsible officers. The Base
                            Commander, whom the President referred to as a “bureaucrat” claimed that
                            his job was to provide security and to feed and perform other
                            housekeeping duties for the men assigned there, and that he had no
                            function of command, including the control of bombs and other armament.
                            The President agreed that he was correct—in accordance with his terms of
                            reference—but that his attitude was somewhat exaggerated and that he
                            should have been aware of events taking place around him. The President
                            then had a frank discussion with the commander of the Fighter-Group and
                            a few of his officers. All expressed their grief over the incident which
                            had dishonored them but disclaimed any knowledge of disaffection,
                            subversive propaganda or other suspicious activities. They admitted that
                            there had been some griping about the lack of conveniences, particularly
                            by those who had spent some time in foreign countries, such as France
                            and the United States and had seen the favored position held by the Air
                            Forces of those countries. There had been complaints about the dangers
                            involved in their operations, the hardship of being assigned away from
                            their families in such areas as Pleiku and Danang, and the overwork
                            produced by the fact that there were too few pilots and planes to meet
                            all operational requirements. Ground crew personnel were particularly
                            unhappy over the fact that, as in most other countries, they could not
                            advance beyond the rank of Master Sergeant. <pb n="189" xml:id="pg_189" facs="0209"/>Some pilots who had undergone intensive training were
                            only too happy to receive desk jobs and to fly only the minimum number
                            of hours required to maintain their flying status.</p>
                        <p>One officer told the President that he (the President) was considered to
                            be a “regular fellow” by the real pilots, because he put in almost as
                            many hours in the air as they did. Only the best pilots were assigned to
                            fly him because, unlike the scheduled airline pilots with their regular
                            routes and replacement personnel, his pilots were asked to follow
                            irregular, hazardous routes for long hours without relief.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> then asked if
                            the President considered the attack upon the palace as the act of two
                            disgruntled, isolated cases, or whether others in the Air Force were
                            implicated. The President replied that, although most of the airmen were
                            young, worked hard and liked to dance and play hard, they were not
                            generally men of ill-will. One of his aides, himself a pilot, had been
                            surrounded by airmen while the President was questioning their leaders.
                            The aide was bombarded with questions concerning the President's
                            feelings concerning the Air Force in general and themselves as
                            individuals.</p>
                        <p>In a subsequent conversation with a senior Air Force officer, the
                            President agreed that the pilots were young, excitable and immature. He
                            further agreed that there should have been a more careful selection made
                            prior to training and that family, education and background should be
                            more meticulously examined. (The father of Lieutenant Cuu, one of the
                            pilots in the attack, had a recorded history of antigovernment
                            activity.)</p>
                        <p>The President next said that General <persName corresp="#p_NK5">Khanh</persName> and other officers had held a meeting the
                            preceding evening to examine the problem of whether the VNAF should be
                            permitted to continue its mission of bombing and close air-support. He
                            said that he personally considered the restrictions which had been
                            imposed a hindrance and was prone to allow them to operate as before.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_NK5">Khanh</persName> had insisted that
                            he proceed slowly—and that he consider the possibility that there might
                            be another fool like the two who had acted. General <persName corresp="#p_NK5">Khanh</persName> told him that the members of the
                            Bien Hoa group were very unhappy and that they wished to make some sort
                            of manifestation to ask the President's pardon. The incident lies
                            heavily upon them.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_NK5">Khanh</persName> had also proposed
                            that the Americans be asked to fly bombing and support missions,
                            accompanied in each case by a Vietnamese. He further proposed that the
                            VNAF first resume its activities by carrying out strafing missions
                            only.</p>
                        <p>As a preliminary to a somewhat lengthy expose of the elements which might
                            have precipitated the incident, the President said that the time
                            selected for the bombing was determined largely by chance. Three days
                            before the attack, the police at Thu Duc arrested a group of men caught
                            in the act of robbing a man who had recently acquired a <pb n="190" xml:id="pg_190" facs="0210"/>large sum of money. They claimed that
                            they were not ordinary bandits but were collecting “political funds” and
                            that they had been instructed to do this by a man named Luc (the father
                            of Lieutenant Cuu, who had dropped the bombs). It is possible, said the
                            President, that Cuu might have considered the entire plan compromised
                            and that, believing himself on the verge of arrest, he decided to
                            flee—attacking the palace on the way. A second incident, not so dear,
                            but which might have had some influence on the act took place some eight
                            days before in the High Plateau close to the Laotian border. In this
                            region, the construction of a tie-road (which the President reminded
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> they had seen
                            together) was badly behind schedule. Finally, the President had become
                            impatient and had ordered the Public Works authorities to look into the
                            real reasons for the delay. It was revealed that the Engineer in charge
                            of road construction in the area had continuously protested that the
                            weather was bad and that coolies were afraid to work because of the lack
                            of security. Further, he had hired two members of his family and placed
                            them in charge of depots where equipment and materials, including
                            explosives were stored. These men had repeatedly told the workers that
                            the Viet Cong was very strong in the area and that there were heavy
                            concentrations of Communist troops immediately across the border. The
                            Public Works investigators became suspicious and seized the records of
                            the depots to check on the receipt and issue of explosives. Since the
                            bombing of the palace, it has been discovered that there is a family
                            connection between them and Lieutenant Quoc—through the wife of the
                            Engineer—a woman named Phu. (Interpreters' Note: Lieutenant Quoc's full
                            name is Phan Phu Quoc.) The President expressed the thought that,
                            although there appears to be no direct connection between the
                            investigation in the High Plateau and the bombing of the palace, the
                            fact that this inquiry was being conducted might have frightened
                                <persName corresp="#p_VQT1">Quoc</persName> and helped to
                            precipitate his action.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> again asked
                            the President if he felt that the information which had been obtained
                            would seem to indicate that the action against him was an isolated,
                            local incident not connected with the Armed Forces or specifically, with
                            the Vietnamese Air Force. The President agreed that this was generally
                            true, but that certain non-flying personnel of the Air Force also seemed
                            to be implicated.</p>
                        <p>The President next spoke of the existence of minor political parties
                            headed by ambitious, unemployed men with little following who worked on
                            the ignorance and the superstitious nature of the people. He talked at
                            length about a man named Thieu (?) who first became active in 1941-1942
                            as head of the National Socialist Party at the time when it appeared
                            that Hitler and his fascism were most successful. Through the years,
                            Thieu had offered his support to the President, changing the name of his
                            party to fit the situation, but always maintaining <pb n="191" xml:id="pg_191" facs="0211"/>his basic theme that the head of state
                            should be a firm fascist and that the superstition of the people should
                            be played upon. At one time, working through an intermediary, he had
                            claimed that he could control the Cao Dai Sect by providing them with
                            more predictions and superstitions than they could invent themselves.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> had consistently
                            refused to accept his support and had, on one occasion, attempted to
                            remove him from the political scene by providing funds for him to
                            establish an arts and crafts center in Thu Duc. The venture failed
                            because Thieu was unsuited for it.</p>
                        <p>To further illustrate the fact that there were people in Vietnam who felt
                            that the President's actions against the Communists and other dissident
                            factions were not severe enough, the President told the story of an
                            officer on the staff of Colonel Cao (7th Division Commander) who, after
                            making a thorough study on coups d'etat, had suggested to Cao that, if
                            he seized the power and exercised it with a firm hand, the people would
                            follow him and obey him.</p>
                        <p>The President next told of an incident in Nha Trang in which a
                            noncommissioned officer had been approached by a man who said that his
                            name was Le Than (the name of a corrupt official of Bao Dai) and who
                            told the soldier that he and people like him would be counted on in the
                            forthcoming revolution. The description of the man fitted Luc, the
                            father of Cuu. He was not taken into custody because of the approaching
                            Tet holidays.</p>
                        <p>Returning to the subject of the attack on the palace, the President said
                            that <persName corresp="#p_VQT1">Quoc</persName> appeared to be hesitant
                            and influenced by Cuu. Both pilots had been assigned to a close support
                            mission on the morning of the 27th of February. They were preceded by
                            two L-19's which were to lead them into the target. Shortly after
                            take-off, Cuu told them over their protest, that he was returning to
                            Bien Hoa because of lack of visibility and then led <persName corresp="#p_VQT1">Quoc</persName> in the attack on the palace.
                            According to the President, it was fortunate that they were not able to
                            discharge their entire load of bombs and rockets—or the palace might
                            have been completely leveled. <persName corresp="#p_VQT1">Quoc</persName>, who is now in custody, told an interrogating
                            officer that he was stupid to have listened to Cuu. He had been told
                            that the dropping of their bombs would be the signal for a general
                            revolt and that “everyone” was in on it—including the Americans. As
                            evidence of the complicity of the Vietnamese officers, Cuu had drawn his
                            attention to the fact that the paratroop battalion guarding Bien Hoa had
                            been replaced by another which he claimed to be in sympathy with the
                            revolt. (The President explained that the battalions had been switched
                            in connection with an operation to resettle the people in Binh Duong
                            Province as part of a clearance program.) To substantiate his claim that
                            the Americans were supporting the revolution, Cuu called <persName corresp="#p_VQT1">Quoc</persName>'s attention to derogatory articles
                            in the press, particularly <hi rend="italic">Newsweek</hi> Magazine. The
                            President expressed the thought that <persName corresp="#p_VQT1">Quoc</persName> might <pb n="192" xml:id="pg_192" facs="0212"/>have
                            become mentally unbalanced and excited by the mass of intrigue and
                            subversive talk to which he had been subjected. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> agreed, adding that his
                            observations seemed to indicate that the act was that of two young men
                            who had been led astray and that it did not go down into the roots of
                            the Vietnamese Army or the Air Force. Then, (referring to the request
                            for U.S. participation in air support) he asked the President how long
                            he thought the investigation would continue. The President replied that,
                            as an individual, he was ready to permit the Air Force to resume its
                            role but that he was obliged to permit the military to carry out its
                            responsibility of getting to the bottom of the story. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> agreed that the
                            military should be granted authority corresponding to its responsibility
                            and added that morale and psychological factors should be considered. He
                            concluded by saying that the United States was prepared to advance with
                            the President “all the way.”</p>
                        <p>The President next spoke of his visit to the area of Zone D in Binh Duong
                            Province on the day following the bombing, saying that he had become
                            impatient with the slowness of the program for regrouping the people of
                            that area into fortified hamlets. It had become obvious that the program
                            had to be carried out simultaneously throughout the province because the
                            Viet Cong were reacting violently to it—forcing women and children to go
                            to “unregrouped” isolated villages, thus putting pressure on the men to
                            go along with them. Without regrouping, pacification could not be
                            realized and military and paramilitary forces were constantly subject to
                            ambush—platoons and even companies had been lost in the area. General
                            Eggleston asked if this program was related to General Cao's program of
                            “Civic Action” teams. The President replied that it was and that,
                            realizing that the job was difficult and unpleasant, he had issued firm
                            orders to permit General Cao to go ahead and to use severe methods,
                            where necessary. As an example he said that, after several warnings,
                            villages had been burned in order to force people to remain in the
                            regroupment areas. General Eggleston then asked the President if he
                            thought fortifications such as fences, ditches and barbed wire to be
                            very important elements of the plan. The President replied that they
                            were basic and added that the Communists had done the same thing against
                            the French and that it had taken an entire battalion a half of a day to
                            penetrate them. He then commented that the Viet Cong were doing the same
                            thing again—aerial photographs had been taken of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> strongholds ringed by concrete lined trenches.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> next asked the
                            President if he had signed the Overall Plan. The President answered that
                            he had not, that he had discussed it with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> and that it had been decided that
                            it <pb n="193" xml:id="pg_193" facs="0213"/>should be coordinated with
                            the Minister of the Interior since it had civilian as well as military
                            aspects. Meanwhile, implementation was going on in the provinces.</p>
                        <p>Reverting once more to the bombing of the palace, the President stated
                            that the Air Force appeared to be “clean” but he was concerned that
                            their exaggerated interest in comfort and conveniences. He compared
                            their situation with that of the ground troops and civilian officials
                            who lived in constant danger to their lives. He suggested that the
                            Americans might attempt to point out to his airmen that their role was
                            not only one of glamour and grandeur, but also of service.</p>
                        <p>The President next spoke to the Ambassador about General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName>'s illness. He said that it
                            was regrettable and paid tribute to the many things that the General had
                            accomplished since his arrival in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> then told the
                            President that he had noticed the pleasure of the people on hearing his
                            voice. It could be seen on their faces. He suggested that when the
                            President felt that the Air Force was ready to resume its role, he might
                            address the people by radio to express his confidence. The President
                            said that it was planned to have a demonstration which would be eloquent
                            enough. The Ambassador repeated his suggestion that an address by radio
                            would be worthwhile, pointing out that this would reach the entire
                            nation. He added that the people wanted to hear the President's voice
                            and that there might be an advantage in making a film which would be
                            seen by the 3,000 people who see the newsreels each week.</p>
                        <p>Turning to Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName>, the President expressed his
                            pleasure over his visit and asked if there was anything that he would
                            like to discuss. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> replied that he had no
                            special points to raise. He reminded the President that he had some
                            responsibility for the United States Military Assistance Program. He had
                            spoken with the Ambassador and U.S. military authorities as well as Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_NK5">Khanh</persName> and felt that his visit had been
                            profitable. He added that the United States public were becoming more
                            and more understanding of the problems of Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that some journalists saw the bombing of the
                            palace as a warning to him. He felt, rather, that it should be a warning
                            to them—an indication of the danger of their irresponsibility. He hoped
                            that the incident would soon be cleared—but expressed his concern over
                            some of the political factions which played on superstition.<note n="2" xml:id="d93fn2">In the margin next to this paragraph <persName corresp="#p_MJA5">Mendenhall</persName> wrote: “Never learns.

                        <p>On March 1, 1962, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
                            gave a press conference that included a prefatory statement on Vietnam.
                            He made the case that North Vietnam violated the Geneva Accords of 1954
                            by perpetrating aggression against the South, that the United States was
                            assisting the people of the South to maintain independence by supplying
                            military and economic assistance and technical advice, that the United
                            States had no intention of sending combat troops to South Vietnam, and
                            that the United States would end assistance to South Vietnam as soon as
                            the threat from the north was removed. For text, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1962</hi>, page

                        <p>1050. International and local U.S. press reporting of events in Viet-Nam
                            as well as news commentators and even some public and private statements
                            by U.S. government officials and military personnel are stressing or
                            implying incorrectly the following themes:</p>
                        <p>1. That U.S. effort is in support of the <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> regime rather than the people of Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>2. That we are in partnership in a common effort rather than in support
                            of a <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> effort.</p>
                        <p>3. That the situation is rapidly turning into a U.S. war rather than a
                            war controlled and directed by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. That U.S. military personnel are in combat status on offensive
                            operations rather than in training, logistics, transportation, support
                            and advisory capacity, defending themselves when attacked.</p>
                        <p>5. That the U.S. is violating the Geneva Accords rather than our
                            assistance is in response to North Vietnamese aggression. This
                            aggression is what constitutes a violation of the Accords, and our
                            assistance will no longer be necessary if the Communist authorities in
                            North Viet-Nam will stop their campaign to destroy the Republic of
                            Viet-Nam.</p>

                            in morning aerial assassination attempt on President were four dead and
                            approximately 30 wounded. Embassy info puts wounded at between 30 and
                            40, many of whom injured in Cholon by falling anti-aircraft fire.</p>
                        <p>2. Security measures have gradually been relaxed in past 48 hours and job
                            of repairing palace already begun. Particularly strategic buildings such
                            as Treasury and Gia Long Palace, where President now living, remain
                            under heavy guard. Tanks and armored cars have disappeared from streets,
                            however, and municipal police and gendarmerie have taken over security
                            controls originally performed by army.</p>
                        <p>3. Information gleaned from interrogation captured pilot, <persName corresp="#p_VQT1">Quoc</persName>, continues indicate very small
                            number of people involved. Father of pilot Cuu who escaped to Cambodia
                            and several others with VNQDD (VN Anti-Communist Nationalist Party)
                            implicated, and Suox [?], Captain <persName corresp="#p_VQT1">Quoc</persName>'s brother, also VNAF pilot, party to plot.</p>
                        <p>However, still no indications other units were prepared to support this,
                            shocked reaction other pilots in AD-6 squadron, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'S rapid and effective response to attack all point to
                            limited scope effort.</p>
                        <p>4. Pilots' motivations not clear. <persName corresp="#p_VQT1">Quoc</persName> one of VNAF'S most outstanding and experienced
                            pilots, though only 1st Lieutenant. Married, he had been at Bien Hoa for
                            six years and under almost continuous <pb n="196" xml:id="pg_196" facs="0216"/>combat conditions for past two years. He recently
                            selected for jet training in U.S. and had been told had excellent chance
                            for promotion and more responsible job on return. Like Cuu, his family
                            had VNQDD history. Cuu's father arrested some two years but, according
                            Dr. Tuyen, head Presidential security service, released at instance Col.
                            Vinh, AF commander. Cuu, also married, in squadron only since December,
                            prior to which had flown l-19's. Considered be good pilot and known to
                            have invited <persName corresp="#p_VQT1">Quoc</persName> to his house
                            several times. What little have in motivation info thus points to
                            political rather than personal grievance compulsion.</p>
                        <p>5. Numerous mass meetings, religious ceremonies, petitions of support,
                            etc., which being publicized indicate <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> may be trying use attack as vehicle for renewed popular
                            support of President and government. Official treatment continues depict
                            incident as isolated act two deranged pilots. No doubt, however, that
                            suspicions of President and family toward Saigon political dissidents
                            and intellectuals will be even stronger in future than in past. Also
                            likely his reluctance trust <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            officials and his unwillingness delegate authority will be strengthened,
                            too.</p>
                        <p>… In talk with U.S. journalist Tuyen hinted all non-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> political circles under suspicion. Thus
                            appears be some possibility <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> may use
                            attack as basis for further restrictions on opposition. Possible augury
                            of such line is motion adopted by Bureau of National Assembly Feb 27
                            calling for “end of tolerance” and severe repression of “irresponsible
                            elements”.</p>
                        <p>According … info some 60 people taken into custody for questioning;
                            number actually detained not known. Tuyen told several journalists no
                            one had been arrested. Among those questioned was reported to be Nguyen
                            Thi Truyen, unsuccessful vice presidential candidate in last April's
                            elections. Cuu's father reportedly still being sought.</p>
                        <p>6. Despite mass meetings, etc., there appears be no pattern of public
                            reaction, which probably due Vietnamese temperament as well as caution.
                            There has been little display of emotion, and most of Saigon appears
                            studiously to have gone about business.</p>
                        <p>We thus unable evaluate at this moment what effect Tuesday's<note n="3" xml:id="d96fn3">February 27.</note> event will have on <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s popular position. We understand
                            most correspondents here describing attack as manifestation <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s basic unpopularity.</p>
                        <pb n="197" xml:id="pg_197" facs="0217"/>
                        <p>7. Grounding of VNAF lifted evening March 1. However, AD-6 armament to be
                            limited for moment to 20mm cannon. President has twice assured AD-6
                            squadron that he did not hold it responsible for acts of two of its
                            pilots and that he continued have confidence in air force.</p>
                        <p>8. So far as we now know, <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> did not
                            attempt exploit confusion surrounding attack on palace, either in Saigon
                            or outside. Seems reasonable believe, however, Commie conviction “enemy
                            divided at home” will be strengthened, and bolder ventures may
                            ensue.</p>
                        <p>9. Effect on <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_RKG1">RKG</gloss> relations will probably be bad. FonMin <persName corresp="#p_VVM1">Mau</persName> told EmbOff March 1 <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> had requested extradition of Cuu, but
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> in speech Feb 27
                            implied he would be granted political asylum. Also noteworthy but not
                            surprising that while messages of sympathy and support being addressed
                            to <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> from many nearby
                            countries, Cambodia not one of senders.</p>
                        <p>10. As all of foregoing indicates, it still too early provide final
                            answers as to scope of plot, attackers' motivations, effect on <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> and on their status in country and abroad. No
                            reason at this time change earlier appraisal of limited-scope,
                            anti-Communist assassination attempt. We are inclined believe that with
                            some luck <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> may succeed in minimizing
                            adverse effects, though we somewhat disquieted by possibility it may
                            react against political opposition in general.</p>

                        <p>While waiting for his appointment with the Under Secretary on March 2,
                            1962 regarding another subject, Ambassador Heeney took the occasion to
                            make some observations to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REE1">Rice</persName> about the question of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The Canadian Ambassador said he thought it had been fruitless to instruct
                            the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa to attempt to persuade the Department of
                            External Affairs of the validity of the legal principle that a breach of
                            an accord by one party automatically allowed the other party to break
                            the agreement also.<note n="2" xml:id="d97fn2">See <ref target="#d55">Document 55</ref>.</note> The Department of External Affairs
                            had reported rather fully to Ambassador Heeney on this approach by the
                            Embassy at Ottawa and had noted that the Embassy had been instructed to
                            make the point that such a legal thesis was based on well recognized
                            principles of international law. The Ambassador added that the legal
                            staff of the Department of External Affairs could not accept such a
                            thesis and could find no legal justification for such an assertion. In
                            any event, he continued, it was not really worthwhile to push this
                            point. He believed that the legal aspects of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> had already become so Byzantine that to add to the
                            complexity of legal assertions would not be productive.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Heeney went on to say it was not for him to say what the
                            United States should or should not do. He understood only too well U.S.
                            anxieties about Vietnam and he shared them. He believed that, if the
                            United States thought the only way to save Vietnam was to bring
                            personnel and materiel above the limits set by the Geneva Accord, then
                            he would be willing to accept this judgement. He would bless any attempt
                            to save Vietnam, but nevertheless saw no point in stressing legalisms.
                            Ambassador Heeney thought a double citation was probably the best
                            solution available at this time, and, in this connection, noted that he
                            had received word from the Canadian Commission in Saigon (Hooton) that
                            it believed it would be possible to bring the subversion issue out of
                            the Legal Committee by mid-March.</p>
                        <p>On another aspect of the same subject, Ambassador Heeney discussed the
                            manner in which U.S. materiel had been brought into Saigon. He
                            understood that the reason for delivery being made in the principal
                            downtown area of Saigon had been to buttress Vietnamese morale and faith
                            in its government being properly equipped to defend itself.
                            Nevertheless, this quite open way of doing things did make matters
                            rather more difficult for the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> and he
                            imagined that the effectiveness of this materiel in coping with
                            insurgency would probably do as much for moral as anything.</p>

                            in Vietnam. The salient facts to be considered are the following:</p>
                        <p>1. Neither US nor <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> planning for civic
                            action in Vietnam can proceed on a sound basis until the overall
                            strategy for the campaign in Vietnam is developed and agreed. The civic
                            action effort must be planned to support the time-phased geographic plan
                            for clearing and holding the country-side. The general concept of a
                            campaign plan is emerging, but the plan has not.</p>
                        <pb n="201" xml:id="pg_201" facs="0221"/>
                        <p>2. The Vietnamese are currently conducting several unsystematic civic
                            action activities, varying by area and means and not guided by a
                            strategic plan. Their primary source of advice and guidance in the civic
                            action field does not appear to be our Country Team.</p>
                        <p>3. Country Team recognition of the need for civic action is recent. Civic
                            action has not been persistently pressed on the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. What has been accomplished appears to be mainly on
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> initiative.</p>
                        <p>4. A clear concept on the U.S. side of the manner in which to unite the
                            divided responsibilities of U.S. agencies in a successful field program
                            in Vietnam has not been demonstrated. A joint State-<gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>-Defense message of 12 Feb 62<note n="3" xml:id="d98fn3">See <ref target="#d64fn6">footnote 6, Document
                                    64</ref>.</note> provides very broad guidance calling for <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> funding of requirements to provide
                            indigenous military forces for which <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                            is responsible, with increased capability to take on civic action and
                            calling for <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> funding of project costs
                            additional to those funded by local governments and of requirements to
                            enhance the civic action capability of the paramilitary forces for which
                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> is responsible. This broad
                            guidance, generally confirming previous understanding, does not solve
                            the problem of how to develop and administer one integrated program,
                            agreed to by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Required Actions by the Country Team</p>
                        <p>Each of the required actions listed below presumes that our Country Team
                            will have completely determined what the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is doing in the civic action field and will, through
                            early consideration of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> views and
                            local circumstances and united persuasion that the U.S. has a sound
                            program to offer in this field, achieve agreement with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> as to requirements, methods, and
                            programs to be implemented.</p>
                        <p>1. Attention to the necessity for a time-phased, geographically based
                            strategy and campaign plan for all of Vietnam that envisions clearing
                            and consolidating areas contiguous to the starting area.</p>
                        <p>2. Development of one integrated comprehensive civic action program
                            phased to support the strategy of the campaign plan. This must be a
                            program of specifics; the generally accepted broad principles thus far
                            announced in various programs do not provide an adequate basis for
                            action in the current stage.</p>
                        <p>3. Division of tasks between the U.S. agencies only on the basis of their
                            capability and willingness to perform the function in the current
                            circumstances in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>4. Assignment of resources to U.S. agencies on the basis of the division
                            of tasks rather than such a basis as <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>

                            Nam or to convince them of the desirability of supporting the present
                            regime. The Information Service, the National Revolutionary Movement
                            (NRM), the Republican Youth Organization (RYO), the Ministry of Health,
                            and the Vietnamese Solidarity Movements are examples of such
                            organizations. Frequently it has occurred that the programs of these
                            organizations combine both material and moral help for the people with a
                            propaganda program, and the lines between the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> purpose of “help” and the regime's purpose of “sell”
                            are difficult to differentiate.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">(2) Organization and Cadres </p>
                        <p>In at least part of the provinces a provincial-level <gloss target="#t_CA1">CA</gloss> organization exists. Below the provincial
                            headquarters there is often, but not always, a chief cadre for each
                            district who may have a number of cadres under him, depending upon the
                            size of the population. These cadres, through the chief cadre, usually
                            coordinate their activities closely with the district chief although the
                            latter in most cases exercises no direct authority over the <gloss target="#t_CA1">CA</gloss> program. Generally the number of cadres
                            is not fixed in a district and may vary from time to time according to
                            the schedule of the <gloss target="#t_CA1">CA</gloss> program. One
                            cadre, however, may be assigned to cover two to four villages on a more
                            or less permanent basis.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_CA1">CA</gloss> cadres often participate in “teams”
                            composed of Information Service cadres, Surete representatives, RYO
                            cadres, and Self Defense Corps members. The teams move about in a
                            district, spending perhaps two or three weeks in a village organizing
                            defenses, explaining <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> policy lines,
                            and exhorting the population to carry out self-help projects.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_CA1">CA</gloss> cadres (25-35) are young,
                            aggressive, and dedicated. They are paid 2,800 piastres a month (the
                            provincial <gloss target="#t_CA1">CA</gloss> chief receives 5,500
                            piastres), a fair wage were it not for their added expenses accruing
                            from their responsibilities of having to live away from home virtually
                            all of the time.</p>
                        <p>One district chief stated the <gloss target="#t_CA1">CA</gloss> cadres
                            are generally educated through the third or fourth year of high school.
                            In addition, they received two months of training with the Ministry.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">(3) Civic Action Activities</p>
                        <p>Civic Action activities can be grouped into two categories1) propaganda
                            and 2) organization of projects generally relating to either defense or
                            community welfare. <gloss target="#t_CA1">CA</gloss> cadres frequently
                            organize “study courses” which are used to “educate” the people about
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> programs and policies and to
                            convince them of the advantages of supporting the present regime. <gloss target="#t_CA1">CA</gloss> objectives in poorer areas are, of
                            necessity, changed from encouragement and organization of community
                            projects to simple propaganda, as the people of such areas are too poor
                            to devote much if any time or money to projects not immediately
                            essential to the providing of the daily necessities of life.</p>
                        <p>The principal job of <gloss target="#t_CA1">CA</gloss>, however, is to
                            aid villagers in the organization and execution of projects designed to
                            benefit the community as a whole. Varying according to the needs and
                            capabilities of the village, such projects include road repair, dam
                            building, canal excavation, construction of tactical defenses, crop
                            protection, and establishment of health programs. They may investigate
                            any “suspicious elements” in a village for <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> activities or connections, and investigate the
                            background of candidates for the village council or any charges of abuse
                            of power leveled against a member of a council. In an emergency
                            involving the safety of the village or the crops, <gloss target="#t_CA1">CA</gloss> cadres may concentrate their efforts on a given area.
                            However, <gloss target="#t_CA1">CA</gloss> itself has no funds to invest
                            in projects and it is always necessary for the villagers to foot the
                            bill themselves on any costs of a project. <gloss target="#t_CA1">CA</gloss> cadres can only explain the utility of the project to
                            the villagers and help them organize the effort. Another activity
                            sometimes engaged in is to coordinate with <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> and other defense groups in conducting security
                            patrols. <gloss target="#t_CA1">CA</gloss> cadres also frequently urge
                            the people to pay their taxes.</p>
                        <p>These activities and programs have a basic limitation in that they do not
                            have funds to assist with the developments that they urge. They are
                            essentially “do-it-yourself” advisors. Their programs call for diversion
                            of local effort and resources to programs not developed at local
                            initiative. This would be more acceptable if some funds were available
                            to the teams to help with local projects. There is recent information
                            that a special responsibility for civic action has been assigned to … .
                            The portion of the total program which he supervises and the resources
                            available to him are not yet clearly reported. He is at least
                            responsible for the Binh Duong and Bien Hoa areas. However, fragmentary
                            reports indicate some activity in these areas and elsewhere. For
                            example, in January 62 President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> ordered a crash civic action program for the newly
                            formed province of Chuong Thieu. By the end of January an initial
                            complement of 100 civic action personnel, of whom 70 had been newly
                            trained and armed with carbines and LSMG's, were organized into ten
                            teams of ten men each. To meet the <pb n="205" xml:id="pg_205" facs="0225"/>estimated 250 additional team members required for this
                            province, 150 were to be assigned from the class of 200 graduating from
                            their training program at Danang in late February.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">(4) Relation to the Overall Strategy</p>
                        <p>Future <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> civic action programs will
                            certainly be geared to the strategic hamlet concept and the overall
                            strategy for clearing and holding areas. This, too, is not yet
                            completely developed. No time-phased priority of clearing the provinces
                            has been announced. However, the scheme for clearing and holding
                            individual provinces appears to be generally understood as depending on
                            a three-phase operation (I—preparatory, II—military, and III—civic
                            action and rehabilitation) to establish strategic hamlets. Civic action
                            plans and requirements will consequently be tied to the strategic plan
                            finally agreed.</p>
                        <p>The costs of this scheme may run high. For example, the relocation costs
                            for only 6,500 people being moved in Binh Duong to five new sites is
                            estimated at $75,000.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> only recently (3
                            Feb) signed the decree establishing an Inter-Ministry Committee for
                            Strategic Hamlets.<note n="10" xml:id="d98fn10">See <ref target="#d46">Document 46</ref>.</note> The mission of this body is to
                            develop a national plan for securing the villages. However, in the
                            meantime, the work is proceeding. There are 16,000 hamlets and 2,500
                            villages in Vietnam. 784 strategic hamlets have already been constructed
                            and 453 are under construction. It is reported that 6,066 are to be
                            completed in 1962.</p>
                        <p>The intent of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> as to an overall
                            strategy is also somewhat clouded by recent actions with regard to the
                            recommendations of British Advisor, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">R.G.K. Thompson</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> has submitted to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> a draft directive for the pacification of the Delta
                            area, which outlines in the form of a National Security Council

                            implementation of the directive. One concerns the general concept,

                        </p>
                        <p>Late evening March 7 two reporters (Hudson of <gloss target="#t_NBC1">NBC</gloss> and Rose of <hi rend="italic">Time</hi>) came by my
                            house to discuss what they termed very important information received by
                            them which was in conflict with their understanding of official US
                            statements. I thanked them for following suggestions made at earlier
                            press briefing that US press corps check doubtful or important
                            information with General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> or me, or designated representatives, prior to
                            broadcast or filing. Reporters then said they had received from a US
                            military source, and had verified through <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> military source, the following: (1) that Farmgate
                            operation was in many cases spearhead of ground support and bombing
                            missions against Viet Cong, including recent operation in Tay Ninh
                            province, results of which had been seen by several reporters: (2) that
                            there are now two air forces in Viet Nam operating against the Viet
                            Cong—the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> Air Force and secondly
                            American units (Farmgate) controlled and operated by US Air Force,
                            comprising T-28's and RB-26's: (3) that during recent grounding of
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> AD-6 squadrons, US had been
                            requested to supply US pilots for the AD-6's for combat missions and had
                            done so; (4) that this report was inconsistent with <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207" facs="0227"/>what had been said in Washington and in
                            Saigon officially as to US military role in Viet Nam. These two
                            reporters added that above information was widely known to foreign
                            reporters now in Viet Nam.</p>
                        <p>I told them following: (1) US role in Viet Nam is, as officially stated,
                            a training and supporting role in air force as well as in all other
                            branches of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> Armed Forces. (2) It is
                            incorrect to say US is “spearheading” ground support and bombing
                            operations against Viet Cong. (3) In training <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> Air Force in operation T-28's, a new plane to them, we
                            are giving on-the-spot training which often involves training under
                            combat conditions, but that in no case do US pilots operate alone,
                            purpose and objective being training of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> pilots for combat operations. (4) Information that we
                            had been requested to fly AD-6's in combat during short period of
                            grounding of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> Air Force was false, as
                            was statement that there are two distinct air forces operating now in
                            Viet Nam. These reporters said they accepted this explanation and would
                            file their stories accordingly, remarking that this made stories
                            considerably less sensational. I have no doubt, however, that they will
                            continue to probe this matter on basis of leads they already have, and
                            try define more precisely role of Farmgate. (This code name was used by
                            them throughout.)</p>
                        <p>As illustrated by above, I feel most US reporters here are trying to play
                            ball with us, but I also have strong feeling that, given number of
                            participants, both US and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, in these
                            air operations, it is inevitable that the degree of US control of
                            mechanics of Farmgate operation, and the degree of US participation in
                            air combat operations, will become increasingly known and stressed in
                            press. (Lt. Cuu, one of renegade pilots now in Cambodia, is undoubtedly
                            familiar with details of Farmgate operation.) Such questions as when
                            will <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> pilots be trained and ready to
                            take over complete control of T-28's and RB-26's now at Bien Hoa will
                            inevitably arise.</p>
                        <p>Believe we should give further thought to adequacy our present line with
                            press in light these insistent inquiries. While official statements
                            correct in general terms, they may become object of criticism or attack
                            when specifics of operation become further known, which is likely.
                            Mission may have further suggestions.</p>

                            intelligence matters should be left to American members of commission,
                            who in best position to judge what is feasible under circumstances.</p>
                        <p>Our comments on other specific suggestions in <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> as follows:</p>
                        <p>1) Agreement already reached with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to
                            form additional teams. Will attempt to increase length of observation
                            time in each province to approximately one week. However, believe
                            possibility of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> opposition or VC
                            harassment may make it necessary to limit survey to shorter period. Rate
                            at which surveys made and written up has been limited by heavy
                            commitments of Vietnamese Team members to other duties. Problem here has
                            been to find qualified Vietnamese team members with knowledge at least
                            French (and English if possible), who have enough authority to command
                            cooperation from local officials but are not too occupied with other
                            duties. This is tall order.</p>
                        <p>2) Future surveys will contain summary.</p>
                        <p>3) Surveys of individual provinces will probably not be suitable vehicle
                            for specific recommendations to be used in making overall policy and for
                            planning and assessing purposes, as perspective from one province only
                            is too limited. However, information accrued through surveys will be
                            used in formulating overall policy and planning for Vietnam and in
                            assessing Vietnam's major needs.</p>

                            here is they should be pushed with all possible speed consistent with
                            requirement for thorough coverage. Consensus also they should include
                            economic and political data and surveys should be focussed on
                            information of direct use to military and coordinated plans.</p>
                        <p>Following questions raised here:</p>
                        <p>1. Since <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> has now accepted
                                <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> approach should not
                            surveys be realigned explicitly to supply requisite planning data on

                                <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> and consider
                            compiling data in some standard format for ready accessibility and
                            comparability.</p>
                        <p>2. Questions Emb Despatch 189<note n="3" xml:id="d101fn3">Not

                            influence. Also in view crucial civic action phase, reliable information
                            on political, economic, and social matters such as the effectiveness of
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> administration and the attitude
                            and livelihood of the populace on village by village basis and
                            availability of local resources for establishment of defended areas.
                            This appears vital to realistic planning for successful outcome.</p>

                            posts but since then there several attacks on <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> forces using somewhat larger, more aggressive, and
                            better armed units. This could represent beginnings of trend in some
                            areas toward larger-scale warfare of type associated with Phase II
                            General Giap's doctrine. We believe <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            not yet capable, however, of full transition Phase II all areas.
                            Furthermore, continued reliance on slower but less provocative process
                            eating away at government administrative structure and presence at
                            district and village level offers Communists several advantages at this
                            stage their revolution. For one thing, it is kind of program which
                            strikes <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> regime at weakest
                            points while avoiding to large extent damaging contact between limited
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> offensive force and much more
                            numerous <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>. It also tactic least

                            concern of Western allies of US. Viet Cong are likely, however, to
                            punctuate this campaign with occasional larger-scale attacks, employing
                            up to 1,000 men or so, against selected targets <pb n="211" xml:id="pg_211" facs="0231"/>which appear to them relatively
                            vulnerable. In each case Communist decision undertake such attack would
                            probably be made only after carefully balancing advantages, in terms
                            heightening <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> morale and perhaps
                            inducing panic in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, against risks of
                            inviting effective <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> counteraction
                            and inspiring escalation American commitments.</p>
                        <p>On organizational side, Communists will continue efforts elaborate
                            controlling political superstructure for <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, giving first priority to development of newly

                            core in National Liberation Front. At same time, Communists will

                            banner, and representatives of Front likely appear in increasing numbers
                            at Communist-supported international conclaves. Although at national
                            level, Front's efforts enlist non-Communist support not notably
                            successful, there considerable evidence that at local level numerous
                            front committees established.</p>
                        <p>Parallel political efforts, Communists continuing emphasize progressive
                            development military forces. After dramatic expansion their forces in
                            1959 and 1960, it reasonable assume substantial consolidation of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> forces has been necessary. There some
                            evidence enemy engaged this process past few months, regrouping smaller
                            guerrilla elements to form district companies and provincial battalions.
                            This effort enhanced by utilization trained cadres infiltrated North
                            Vietnam, for which <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> has substantial
                            manpower reservoir in form more than 80,000 troops evacuated from south
                            after Geneva Armistice. Some of these regrouped southerners demobilized
                            and assigned “production” elements, but 50,000 were used form four PAVN
                            infantry divisions.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> deployment in Laos intimately
                            connected with support of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> in addition,
                            of course, to backing up PL, by insuring safe transit supplies and cadre
                            to South Vietnam. There is in fact evidence <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> units assisting in preparing logistical system (roads
                            and supply points) for support <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> effort.
                            Possibly offsetting this advantage, at least for short term, is
                            continued delay in reaching settlement in Laos leading coalition
                            government under <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna Phouma</persName>.
                            So long as this question unresolved, <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            probably feels it must be ready participate resumed hostilities which
                            now seem only alternative to a <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna</persName> coalition. This may detract somewhat from
                            attention it pays to South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Due to nature of war here, it difficult draw up balance sheet for past
                            few months. <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>, with American

                            with large enemy concentration and exploit sudden encounters with <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> by calling for air strikes. On other
                            hand, incident rate has remained extremely high, and Viet Cong, while
                            sustaining substantial casualties themselves, able inflict rather heavy

                            Perhaps best estimate is that there more or less military standoff with
                            both sides gradually improving respective capabilities.</p>
                        <p>Fact <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> has in general concentrated on
                            small-scale activity recent months, eschewing more sensational attacks
                            mounted Sept, should provide no grounds complacency. Enemy is
                            determined, resourceful and controls substantial areas in countryside.
                            Government cannot hope begin long, slow road to victory until it better

                            aimed at giving peasant stake in defense his village against <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>In discussing contrast between large-scale Sept attacks and subsequent
                            pattern smaller-scale activity, two main bodies opinion developed in
                            committee… . These attacks and in fact general <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> posture last summer indicated enemy actually in process
                            moving into Phase II Giap's doctrine but later decided regress Phase I
                            for number reasons. Other view, advocated by political section and
                            evaluation center, was that these attacks represented specific use of
                            tactic associated with Phase II to secure infiltration routes, redress
                            morale balance and regain initiative following the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s temporary successes in Delta.
                            Whatever the case, committee agreed they presently operating generally

                        <p>2. Extent of population indoctrination prior to Phase II.</p>

                        <p>6. Possibility of success in view of strong <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> position in north part of province and zone D to the
                            east (it is of interest that in past 10 days, <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> have increased scope of operations in Tay Ninh Province

                                speech. The speech dealt mainly with the provision of security in
                                the countryside, complaining that training and equipping a
                                paramilitary force to provide such security has been difficult for
                                Vietnam, “especially when its allies refused to recognize the need
                                for such forces.” (Ibid.)</note> Mme. <persName corresp="#p_TLX1">Nhu</persName>'s
                            address at Trung sisters ceremony made in her capacity as
                            President-Founder of Vietnamese Women's Solidarity Movement. Diplomatic
                            Corps and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> ministers present. Her
                            remarks, which subsequently broadcast, are not surprising as reflection
                            views of her and her husband vis-à-vis West, including US, since both
                            Nhus have privately expressed opinions generally along these lines in
                            past. Even President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> has in
                            private conversation attributed lack of security in countryside to
                            alleged failure US to support Civil Guard at earlier stage.</p>
                        <p>What is new, however, is public expression these sentiments by leading
                            personality of regime. Their vehemence indicates depth of feeling
                            probably intensified by narrow escape of Nhus in recent palace bombing
                            episode. While we have not seen complete range Western press reaction
                            (including <hi rend="italic">Time</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Newsweek</hi>) to bombing, we believe that if stress is on
                            unpopularity Diem government and/or Nhus, <persName>Ngo</persName>
                            family feelings will be even further stirred up, and recurrence last
                            November's anti-American press campaign could be cranked up.</p>
                        <p>Believe therefore that I should promptly make oral protest to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. I would put protest in context that
                            public statements of this sort make task of Western, and particularly
                            American friends of Vietnam inordinately difficult. I would point out
                            that Madame <persName corresp="#p_TLX1">Nhu</persName>'s public speech presents gravely
                            unbalanced view of what Western democracies, particularly US, are doing
                            with their immense assistance to help Vietnam in its mortal struggle
                            against Communists. American public which is wholeheartedly supporting
                            this struggle can only be discouraged by statements of this sort. Raking
                            over past is not key to future cooperation. Even past has two sides,
                            however, and further public presentation by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> of one side only may compel US press present other
                            side, with resultant public dispute which can only please Communists.
                            Finally, I would protest implication of foreign incitement to murder,
                            and stress that public figure, whether American or Vietnamese, must
                            expect receive criticism as well as praise. I would propose make protest
                            to Secretary of State for Presidency, <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>.</p>
                        <pb n="216" xml:id="pg_216" facs="0236"/>
                        <p>I recognize that démarche along these lines unlikely have any effect on
                            attitude of Nhus and could well increase their anti-American sentiments.
                            By privately indicating our concern, however, we may forestall anti-US
                            press campaign which otherwise likely be stimulated by expected US press
                            reaction to speech. Whether or not démarche has this result, my personal
                            view is that United States on prestige grounds should not ignore public
                            statement of this kind by figure as closely associated with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> as Madame <persName corresp="#p_TLX1">Nhu</persName>.</p>

                            The latter as the close-in defender of the strategic hamlet and defender
                            village; the former as the wider-ranging provincial patrol force and

                            originally suggested use of the National Police for provincial security,
                            but later agreed with the US view that existing para-military assets in

                        <p>There are certain essential considerations in reaching a decision as to
                            the force levels the US reasonably could support in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. Some of these have been cited by
                            Defense or State; none are sufficiently developed to permit governing
                            conclusions. Each should be the subject of further analysis or
                            discussion with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> stresses the need to assure
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> organizes and employs existing
                            military and para-military resources properly before moving too rapidly
                            toward increases in strength. There are insufficient indications now as
                            to what the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is actually capable of
                            doing and what military strength is required. The best data available
                            suggests the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> has not decreased
                            static tasks despite US provision of transport aircraft and helicopters.
                            Rangers still are not committed to jungle/border functions. At the same
                            time, recent increases in the means for air and water mobility, the need
                            to strengthen force capability in the Plateau area, and expanded
                            training facilities have resulted in the need for <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> personnel increases (reflected in
                            the FY 62 figure of 206,662).</p>

                            areas swept by the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> and in which
                            population resettlement has been accomplished. Numbers of para-military
                            forces required for this purpose are not yet known; there is some
                            uncertainty, in US circles, as to numbers now in each province. <pb n="219" xml:id="pg_219" facs="0239"/>Tentative estimates for <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>

                            normal manning level in that area. A prime factor in any build-up is the
                            present saturated training organization for the <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>; personnel now
                            in those categories will not all complete the training course until the

                            reluctant to move <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> forces away from their village and
                            province assignments to fight elsewhere. To the degree that this is
                            done, the local intelligence capability, area familiarity, and morale of
                            these troops would be compromised. But at the same time, this reduces
                            the flexible use of security forces to concentrate at points of

                            Security Force levels rather than in the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>, are:</p>
                        <p>(1) Better use of available manpower; skilled personnel will be drawn off

                            training.</p>
                        <p>c. Determine areas in which the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> can
                            be released from static functions and made strategically mobile; press

                            their force employment.</p>
                        <p>d. Assess the need for additional US air transport to force-feed <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> mobility and reduce reliance on land
                            lines of communication.</p>
                        <p>e. Complete development of an overall military strategy for <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> so that force structures may be viewed

                            <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> could not have taken
                            protest better, and I had distinct impression that he was personally
                            pleased that it had been made. He said that he himself had been
                            “shocked” by speech and appreciated difficulties it caused for US. He
                            recognized tremendous effort US making in Viet Nam and, referring to my
                            remarks re problems posed for friends of Viet Nam, said that he thought
                            US-Vietnamese relations had never been better. He attributed this in
                            large part to attitude displayed by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>, General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>, General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName>, and myself.</p>
                        <p>Requesting that I treat his remarks with utmost confidence, he asked that
                            we understand extreme delicacy of his position, insofar as doing
                            anything about Madame <persName corresp="#p_TLX1">Nhu</persName> is concerned. It was a
                            family matter in which it was awkward to intrude.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> concluded by saying that he
                            would convey my remarks promptly to President Diem pointing out that
                            they had been made on instructions. I thanked him and said that the
                            fundamental purpose of the approach had been to facilitate
                            American-Vietnamese cooperation.</p>

                            the Constitution or treaty or statute does President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> derive the right to order
                            United States military personnel to transport South Vietnamese troops
                            into combat, to return the fire of North Vietnamese, to patrol the sea
                            approaches to South Viet-Nam and to drop propaganda leaflets over areas
                            held by the guerrillas opposing the Government of South Viet-Nam?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Answer:</hi> (Unclassified) Article II of the
                            Constitution makes the President Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy
                            of the United States, and vests in him the executive power. Article II
                            has also been interpreted as making the President the “sole organ of the
                            nation” in the field of foreign affairs (<hi rend="italic">United
                                States</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Curtiss-Wright</hi>, 299 U.S. 304,
                            318 ff. (1936)). These constitutional powers give the President
                            authority to deploy United States military personnel abroad.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the President's constitutional powers, the Congress has
                            enacted Section 503 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 which
                            authorizes the President to furnish military assistance abroad, inter
                            alia, by “… assigning or detailing members of the armed forces of the
                            United States … to perform duties of a noncombatant nature, including
                            those related to training or advice.”<note n="4" xml:id="d108fn4">P.L.

                        </p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the United States and Viet-Nam are parties to the agreement
                            for Mutual Defense Assistance in Indochina of December 23, 1950 (TIAS
                            2447; 3 U.S.T. 2756) which was concluded pursuant to P.L. 329, 81st
                            Congress (63 Stat. 714, 22 U.S.C. 1571-1604). This agreement provides
                            for the furnishing by the United States to Viet-Nam, among others, of
                            military assistance in the form of equipment, material and services.
                            Article IV, paragraph 2, of the agreement states that “To facilitate
                            operations under this agreement, each Government agrees … to receive
                            within its territory such personnel of the United States of America as
                            may be required for the purposes of this agreement … .”</p>
                        <p>Under these provisions the United States has since 1950 provided military
                            assistance to Viet-Nam in the form of training, equipment and logistic
                            support. The activities mentioned in the question are an expansion of
                            this training and logistic support role. The transportation or troops is
                            logistic support. The sea patrols referred to are carefully limited to
                            training operations and the exchange of intelligence with <pb n="223" xml:id="pg_223" facs="0243"/>Vietnamese naval units. Our assistance
                            to the Vietnamese in dropping leaflets over isolated parts of Viet-Nam
                            has similarly been confined to training and logistic aspects of the
                            operation.</p>
                        <p>Given the activities in which they are engaged, and the character of
                            guerrilla warfare, in which hostilities occur sporadically at scattered
                            points throughout the country, we had to face the possibility that
                            United States personnel would come under hostile fire. In these
                            circumstances, it was obvious that they would have to be able to defend
                            themselves, and the President has accordingly authorized them to fire,
                            if fired upon, if necessary for self-defense.</p>

                            Defense Assistance in Indochina of December 23, 1950. These personnel
                            are engaged in activities of a noncombatant nature, primarily in
                            training, logistic and advisory capacities, designed to assist the
                            Government of the Republic of Viet-Nam to counter the indirect
                            aggression directed against it from the North.</p>
                        <p>United States forces were sent into direct combat operations in South
                            Korea to repel the aggressive armed attack launched on June 25, 1950 by
                            North Korea against the Republic of Korea. On the same day the United
                            Nations Security Council adopted a resolution calling upon all members
                            to render every assistance to the United Nations in the situation. The
                            Korean National Assembly, on June 26, appealed both to the United States
                            and the United Nations for assistance. On June 27, 1950 the Security
                            Council adopted a resolution recommending that members of the United
                            Nations furnish such assistance to the Republic of Korea as might be
                            necessary to repel the attack. The Security Council, on July 7,
                            established a United Nations Command under the United States. In these
                            circumstances, the President on the basis of his constitutional
                            authority sent United States forces to Korea.</p>
                        <p>United States forces were deployed in Lebanon in 1958 pursuant to an
                            urgent request from the Government of Lebanon which felt itself
                            threatened by externally inspired civil strife. These troops were sent
                            to Lebanon under the President's constitutional authority as
                            Commander-in-Chief. President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> stated that United States forces had been
                            sent to Lebanon “to protect American lives and by their presence there
                            to encourage the Lebanese Government in defense of Lebanese sovereignty

                        <p>It will be recalled that pursuant to President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>'s request the Congress had
                            on March 9, 1957, passed a joint resolution to promote peace and
                            stability in the Middle East which provided in part, “if the President
                            determines the necessity thereof, the United States is prepared to use
                            armed forces to assist any such nation or group of such nations
                            requesting assistance against armed aggression from any country
                            controlled by international communism:” (P.L. 85-7, 85th Congress). In
                            sending United States troops to Lebanon, the President did not make use
                            of this joint resolution since the Lebanon situation did not involve
                            Communist armed aggression as contemplated by the resolution.</p>
                        <p>In the Lebanon situation, United States forces neither engaged in combat
                            operations as in the Korean conflict nor in training or advisory
                            functions as is the case today in Viet-Nam. Their mere presence in
                            Lebanon had the desired effect of helping to restore order and
                            tranquility there.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Answer:</hi> (Unclassified) As indicated in question 1
                            above the President has power under the Constitution to take the actions
                            presently being carried on in Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>It is obviously desirable that the Congress understand the basis for
                            Presidential actions of this character and fully support them.
                            Traditionally these objectives have been achieved by consultation
                            between officers of the Executive Branch and members and Committees of
                            Congress having responsibility in the premises, particularly the Senate
                            Foreign Relations Committee. In the present case the President has asked
                            that the fullest and freest consultation with the Committee and the
                            Congressional leadership be maintained. He has himself met with
                            appropriate members of the Congress on several occasions to discuss the
                            problems in Viet-Nam. The Secretary has frequently testified before this
                            Committee on the same subject, and has discussed it informally on many
                            occasions with the members of the Committee. The Assistant Secretary for
                            Far Eastern Affairs with appropriate members of his staff are and have
                            been available for the purpose of consultation.</p>
                        <p>On two occasions in the past, where it seemed possible that the President
                            would wish to commit United States forces to combat operations,
                            President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> decided to
                            invite Congress to associate itself with his exercise of his
                            constitutional functions as Commander-in-Chief, primarily in order to
                            provide a convincing demonstration of United States unity on the issues
                            there involved. We have not thought <pb n="225" xml:id="pg_225" facs="0245"/>that such action has been called for to this point.
                            However, should circumstances develop in which a formal expression of
                            Congressional support seems desirable, the President undoubtedly would
                            not hesitate to seek an appropriate resolution.</p>

                            actions by United States military personnel in South Viet-Nam considered
                            to be combat actions?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Answer:</hi> (Unclassified) As the President said in
                            his Press Conference on February 14, “We have not sent combat troops in
                            the generally understood sense of the word.”<note n="7" xml:id="d108fn7">See <ref target="#d68fn3">footnote 3, Document 68</ref>.</note> The
                            United States is assisting Vietnamese combat units with training,
                            logistic, transportation and advisory personnel.</p>
                        <p>The nature of the activities in which United States military personnel
                            are engaged in Viet-Nam is dictated by the very character of guerrilla
                            war. Hostilities are not concentrated in any well-defined area; rather,
                            fighting is likely to break out sporadically and without warning in any
                            part of the country. The “front” is not fixed as in the classical
                            situation; the front literally is everywhere. In these circumstances, as
                            indicated in Question 1 above, the President has ordered our military
                            personnel in Viet-Nam to fire back in self-defense if fired upon.</p>
                        <p>As noted above, United States military personnel in Viet-Nam are
                            noncombatants. In the seven years since 1955 violence in Viet-Nam has
                            claimed about 26,000 casualties. Of these, fifteen have been American
                            personnel (four killed, ten wounded, one missing). Despite our increased
                            activities in Viet-Nam, we would hope that these casualties can continue
                            to be kept at a minimum.</p>

                            to Chapter III entitled “Ban on Introduction of Fresh Troops, Military

                            <hi rend="italic">Answer:</hi> (Confidential) The United States did not
                            sign the 1954 Geneva Accords and is not a party thereto. At the time of
                            conclusion of the Accords, Under Secretary of State Walter Bedell Smith
                            stated that the United States “would view any renewal of the aggression
                            in violation of the … agreements with grave concern and as seriously
                            threatening international peace and security.” We have maintained the
                            view expressed in General <persName corresp="#p_SBK1">Smith</persName>'s
                            statement, and our present actions in Viet-Nam are fully in accord with
                            that policy.</p>
                        <p>However, North Viet-Nam which is a party to the Accords has consistently
                            violated the agreements by directing, assisting, supplying, and
                            reinforcing guerrilla forces in South Viet-Nam and by illegal
                            introduction into North Viet-Nam of military personnel and war
                            materials.</p>

                        <p>International law recognizes the principle that a material breach of a
                            treaty by one party entitles the other at least to withhold compliance
                            with an equivalent, corresponding or related provision until the other
                            party is prepared to observe its obligations. Both the United States and
                            Viet-Nam have made it clear that if North Viet-Nam would comply with the
                            provisions of the Geneva Accords, increased United States assistance
                            would no longer be necessary. Legally, the actions of the Government of
                            the Republic of Viet-Nam in requesting and receiving additional
                            assistance from the United States are fully consistent with the above
                            principle.</p>

                            gains force in the present context from the fact that actions being
                            taken by the Government of Viet-Nam can be related to the requirements
                            of legitimate self-defense necessitated by the breaches of the other

                            Vietnamese Government can only be judged against its circumstances. It
                            is a new country emerging from fifteen years of war and eighty years of
                            colonial control. During half its six years of existence it has fought
                            off the threat of Communist conquest. Its political policy has been to
                            lay the <pb n="228" xml:id="pg_228" facs="0248"/>infrastructure of
                            democracy” through education, transportation and communication. Despite
                            the war the number of children in Vietnamese elementary schools has
                            grown in five years to 1,100,000, an increase of 272%, and a far better
                            record than that of Communist North Viet-Nam. The Government of Viet-Nam
                            has also made a proud record in expanding transportation, communication
                            and health services. Its per capita food production and per capita gross
                            national product are growing and are both higher than in North Viet-Nam.
                            This is a good indication that the Government of free Viet-Nam with U.S.
                            help has made more effective progress than has North Viet-Nam under
                            Communist control. Statistical evidence carefully compiled from the best
                            sources available is enclosed.<note n="8" xml:id="d108fn8">Not attached
                                to the source text.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>On the other hand Government effectiveness in South Viet-Nam has been
                            hampered by over-centralization, overlapping agencies and insufficient
                            understanding between the governing and the governed. While this is
                            partly due to the lack of competent administrators, it is also true that
                            a greater number of competent administrators could have been developed
                            if they had been given more responsibility and authority.</p>
                        <p>Another fact which has hampered the effectiveness of the Government of
                            Viet-Nam is that President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>
                            does not possess the magnetic qualities needed to rally his people
                            enthusiastically to his Government's programs.</p>
                        <p>There is evidence of corruption in the Government of Viet-Nam. There is
                            no evidence of corruption on the part of President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> and he has carried on an extensive
                            and well-publicized campaign to punish corrupt officials. Several have
                            been publicly tried and punished.</p>
                        <p>Some official corruption is endemic in Southeast Asian countries. The
                            amount of corruption in Viet-Nam does not appear to be greater than in
                            neighboring countries. However, it has damaged the prestige of the
                            Government of Viet-Nam because exaggerated stories of official
                            corruption are widely believed. We have checked these stories carefully
                            and find no evidence for many of them. However, the Government of
                            Viet-Nam has not done an effective job setting the record straight with
                            its own people.</p>
                        <p>Two attempts have been made against President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>. Both were military in origin and seem to have been
                            motivated by the feeling that the government was not giving them the
                            authority to press on vigorously with the anti-Communist struggle. The
                            attempts failed. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>
                            is clearly in control as the legitimate and elected head of the
                            government. No other group has any appreciable degree of popular
                            support. In the circumstances of war and tension existing in Viet-Nam,
                                <pb n="229" xml:id="pg_229" facs="0249"/>some discontent must be
                            expected. Also the trouble lies partly with <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s inability to project adequately his own many good
                            qualities of leadership to his people. (End Secret)</p>

                        <p>However, the following has clearly emerged in the intervening three
                            months:</p>
                        <p>1. There is a much closer and more effective working relationship between
                            the United States Government and the Government of Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>2. American military advisers have been accepted and listened to in a
                            variety of roles.</p>
                        <p>3. The Vietnamese National Internal Security Council (War Cabinet) has
                            met more frequently and is playing a somewhat greater role.</p>
                        <p>4. There has been increased freedom of debate in the National
                            Assembly.</p>
                        <p>5. The military command structure has been strengthened, but considerable
                            improvement is still needed.</p>
                        <p>6. U.S. and Vietnamese officials have embarked on joint studies of local
                            conditions.</p>
                        <p>7. Civic action and plans for village and hamlet defense are being made.
                            Further coordination and better implementation are needed.</p>
                        <p>8. Provincial Councils are being created. It is too soon to judge their
                            usefulness.</p>
                        <p>9. There have been increases in military salaries and benefits.</p>
                        <p>10. A wide range of sound measures have put the economy on a sounder
                            basis.</p>
                        <p>11. A National Economic Council has been formed and has commenced
                            examination of government development plans. Its activities will be slow
                            and cautious.</p>
                        <p>12. The effectiveness of military intelligence has been greatly
                            increased.</p>
                        <p>13. Flood relief and rehabilitation have been carried out with good
                            effect.</p>
                        <p>14. The President has increased his travels to the provinces.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Answer:</hi> (Secret) The Communist objective remains
                            that of eliminating United States influence and presence from Viet-Nam
                            and of replacing it by Communism. They have so far maintained
                            coordination <pb n="231" xml:id="pg_231" facs="0251"/>within the
                            Communist bloc in their attempts to attain this objective. While the
                            tempo of Viet Cong activity is likely to increase in Viet-Nam, there
                            seems little prospect at present that the pattern of this activity will
                            change quickly and drastically.</p>
                        <p>In looking further it must be remembered that Hanoi and Peking are more
                            militantly revolutionary than Russia and consider their interests to be
                            more directly involved in Viet-Nam than Russia's.</p>
                        <p>If Viet-Nam's efforts to defend itself are more successful, Hanoi, with
                            military forces of 300,000 available, will be strongly tempted to
                            increase the strength of its attacks. To Hanoi the struggle is at least
                            as much a struggle for national reunification as an ideological
                            struggle. It has largely committed its prestige to this struggle.</p>
                        <p>However, the following factors are likely to deter an overt escalation by
                            North Viet-Nam in a situation where South Viet-Nam is defending itself
                            with increasing success:</p>
                        <p>1. Hanoi would not welcome the presence of a large number of Chinese
                            Communist troops in North Viet-Nam. China is the traditional enemy.
                            North Viet-Nam does not want to become another Chinese sphere of
                            influence.</p>
                        <p>2. North Viet-Nam fears Free World retaliation.</p>
                        <p>3. Hanoi desires to retain some latitude of action by playing off Moscow
                            and Peking.</p>
                        <p>4. Moscow might increase its military aid to Hanoi, but would probably
                            prefer to see a conference on Viet-Nam rather than a full scale war m
                            Viet-Nam, an area which Russia probably does not consider vital to its
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>5. There appears to be some Communist belief, particularly in Moscow,
                            that even if South Viet-Nam is able to resist temporarily, it will, in
                            the long run, fall to Communism.</p>
                        <p>If Viet Cong success increases, the present guerrilla struggle will be
                            likely to move up the scale, in the pattern of Communist wars of
                            “national liberation”, towards open war involving increasingly large
                            troop formations. A “liberated” area and “liberation government” would
                            probably be established. However, the formation of a “liberation
                            government” would not be an automatic signal for Communist military
                            escalation.</p>
                        <p>It appears more likely that the present pattern, a long, wearing
                            struggle, will continue. The South Vietnamese effort, with U.S. support
                            is designed to meet this challenge. Time is not necessarily on the side
                            of the guerrilla, as shown in Greece, the Philippines and Malaya. The
                            Viet Cong probably must escalate their guerrilla war to open war in
                            order to conquer the country. If they should decide to escalate to
                            larger, open formations, it will be a particularly dangerous time for
                            them. On the other hand continuation of present guerrilla destruction
                            risks angering the peasant without winning the war. Since Communist
                            propaganda carries limited conviction in Viet-Nam, where so many <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0252"/>have already lived under their
                            domination, the Viet Cong guerrillas must operate through fear and
                            coercion as well as through propaganda and persuasion to obtain men and
                            food. The South Vietnamese counter-guerrilla strategy seeks to save the
                            peasant, conserve his property and deprive the Viet Cong of their needs
                            so that they will have to take increasingly cruel measures to obtain
                            food, arms and men. (End Secret)</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Q. No. 15.</hi> (Unclassified) I find myself unclear
                            as to the Soviet Union's attitude toward and role in the Viet-Nam
                            conflict. I would like an assessment of that question. More
                            specifically, I would like to know whether Russian and Czech arms are
                            being made available to the Viet Cong-if so, whether the levels of such
                            assistance are appreciable or token.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Answer:</hi> (Begin Secret) As indicated above the
                            Soviet Union for the present probably desires to avoid an enlargement of
                            the struggle in Viet-Nam to the point which would increase the
                            likelihood of a major war. If, however, South Viet-Nam's defensive
                            efforts become more successful, the USSR might feel constrained to
                            redress the balance by increased aid to North Viet-Nam in order to
                            reduce the likelihood of a large scale Chinese Communist intervention.
                            Moscow cannot appear to oppose Communist expansion in underdeveloped
                            areas.</p>
                        <p>While the Soviet attitude towards Viet-Nam will be largely influenced by
                            developments in Laos, as well as by its own relations with Communist
                            China and by developments on disarmament and in Berlin, it seems
                            probable that at present Moscow does not want any major escalation in
                            Viet-Nam. This attitude will not prevent the continuation of Russian and
                            Communist bloc military aid to North Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>Communist bloc military aid to North Viet-Nam has been large and
                            effective. However, the Viet Cong have sought to avoid the use of
                            Communist manufactured arms in South Viet-Nam. (End Secret)</p>

                        <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alexis</persName>: The Department of
                            Defense has completed a review of the required force structure and
                            strengths for the Republic of Vietnam Armed Forces (<gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>), Civil Guard (<gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss>) and Self Defense Corps (<gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>) through 1964. Our analysis included
                            consideration of the following factors:</p>
                        <p>1. The build-up of Viet Cong forces in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>2. The expansion of Communist control in Laos.</p>
                        <p>3. The progress of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in planning
                            for and conducting security operations.</p>
                        <p>4. The capability of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to train,
                            maintain and effectively utilize their forces.</p>
                        <p>5. The need for the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to husband its
                            manpower resources carefully.</p>
                        <p>6. The force structure best reconciling the requirements of coordinated
                            and phased counter-insurgency operations with available leadership;
                            and</p>
                        <p>7. The requirement for long range planning for South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>From our analysis we conclude that <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                            support should be authorized for the FY 62 and FY 63 <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> force levels shown below; and that the
                            FY 64 <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> force levels shown below
                            should be approved for <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> planning

                            proposed for end FY 63, are prorated as $11.6 million for FY 1962 and
                            $21.7 million for FY 1963.</p>
                        <p>It is anticipated that some <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> support
                            may also be required later for selected paramilitary local defense
                            groups. Modest support may be required to prepare selected paramilitary
                            forces for use in support of the plans developed for the campaign in
                            South Vietnam. Our estimates of the extent and duration of required
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> support for forces of <pb n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0254"/>this nature are not yet firm.
                            It will depend on the role that these groups accept in support of
                            refined counter-insurgency plans. We now envision that as clearing
                            actions are initiated in the areas where these groups operate, they
                            might be integrated into the <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> for support of holding operations.</p>
                        <p>The Department of Defense recommends prompt approval of support of the
                            above force levels, to insure most timely availability of trained and
                            effective operational forces considered essential for attainment of U.
                            S. objectives in South Vietnam. As you know, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> and the Country Team concur in

                            afternoon March 12 at his request. In course of two hour meeting,
                            primarily devoted to <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s views
                            re military situation in central highlands and central coastal plain,
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> asked when
                            limitations on armament of VNAF planes would be lifted (as of that time
                            our information was that they were still limited to 20-mm cannon, except
                            in I corps area). <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> indicated
                            that he was not prepared to permit planes to carry bombs until system of
                            “control” had been devised which would ensure that pilots hit targets
                            they were supposed to. He did not specify what sort of control might
                            accomplish this. Although not willing to permit planes to carry bombs
                            which could “destroy buildings”, <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> indicated that he might be prepared to permit them
                            to carry rockets and napalm. In pointing out dangers of permitting
                            planes to carry bombs, <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>
                            remarked that even if an irresponsible pilot were shot down, plane with

                            expressed concern over continuation of restrictions, emphasizing not
                            only military handicaps but awkward position in which United States
                            Government was placed. US role in Viet Nam was to assist <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to win its war; it was not a US war,
                            undeclared as some press releases indicate or otherwise. Restrictions on
                            VNAF tended to undercut this position. <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> did not reply directly.</p>
                        <p>Following day, March 13, I raised matter with <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> with Generals Ty and <persName corresp="#p_NK5">Khanh</persName> of joint general staff, along
                            same lines we had taken with <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said that
                            restrictions were being lifted immediately except on 250 pound and 500
                            pound bombs. Planes would, however, be allowed to carry rockets, napalm
                            and anti-personnel bombs, which <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said was only type of bomb needed in “war of this
                            kind”. (He telephoned March 14 to say that he had just signed order to
                            this effect.) General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>
                            was informed by Ty and <persName corresp="#p_NK5">Khanh</persName>
                            that background investigation of pilots was continuing but was expected
                            to be completed by about April 1. They also said that “controls”
                            envisaged were radar and definitive flight plans.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> informed by <persName corresp="#p_NK5">Khanh</persName> today that <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>'s order had been received and put
                            into effect, i.e., VNAF planes now authorized carry 20-mm., rockets,
                            napalm and anti-personnel bombs.</p>

                            survey teams using that plan as framework for their investigations,
                            seeking develop information which would be useful in its implementation.
                            I thought that in order to accomplish this, it might be necessary to
                            extend period devoted to <pb n="236" xml:id="pg_236" facs="0256"/>surveys to about one week per province. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> agreed with these suggestions but was not at that
                            time prepared to set date for start-up of next surveys or to name <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> representatives. It was clear from his
                            remarks that he expects to have trouble finding qualified people who can
                            be spared full time for this work. He did say that he had already
                            discussed recommendations of first surveys with President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> and planned to have further
                            discussion next day with him with view to getting recommendations
                            implemented.</p>
                        <p>We will continue to press <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to get
                            further surveys under way. It is our hope that <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>'s informal agreement to key
                            surveys to Delta Plan will permit expansion into political, economic and
                            social areas, without risks of rejection or at least delay which would
                            be involved in proposing explicitly that terms of reference of surveys
                            be changed with reference points raised <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 1085:</p>
                        <p>(1) Every effort will be made to gear surveys to needs Delta Plan. <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> has developed new checklist and we
                            will seek to have surveys concentrate on those provinces slated for
                            early clearing and holding operations. Results of surveys will also be
                            combined with large slides specific information being developed through
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> channels.</p>
                        <p>(2) Effort will be made to reach village level in surveys. Do not believe
                            practicable, however, have surveys proceed on village-by-village basis.
                            This would not only involve proposing change in terms of reference (with
                            risks indicated above) but would, we estimate, require extension of time
                            spent in each province to two or three weeks, with resulting heavy drain
                            scarce <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> manpower, maximum disruption
                            normal provincial administration, and increased security risks.
                            Moreover, much detailed information for planning purposes can be and is
                            being developed in other ways, for example, through <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CIO1">CIO</gloss>
                            surveys of provincial <gloss target="#t_NPSS1">NPSS</gloss> units
                            already in progress </p>
                        <p>(3) Believe important value first set surveys was catalogue intelligence
                            and military shortcomings that could be immediately corrected, plus
                            on-the-spot remedial action by officials concerned. Wish continue stress
                            this approach, while at same time using surveys to generate information
                            for implementation outline plan for counterinsurgency. Believe surveys
                            should fill out and provide check on information obtained from <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> for planning purposes, but do not
                            believe we should make them sole instrument for developing such

                        <p>The Communist rebels continue their attacks with company and
                            battalion-sized units, in contrast to much smaller groups of men
                            formerly employed. Attacks are made against lines of communication and
                            isolated guard posts. The brunt of the attack therefore is directed
                            against the civil defense forces rather than against the principal units
                            of the regular armed forces.</p>
                        <p>The propaganda barrage against United States assistance to South Viet Nam
                            continues to increase and the rebels are receiving increased logistic
                            support from North Viet Nam. Propaganda broadcasts to South Viet Nam
                            have reached an all time high and emanate from many sources both within
                            and without South Viet Nam.</p>
                        <p rend="center">… … .</p>
                        <p>The U.S. program in South Viet Nam still has not reversed the level nor
                            intensity of Viet Cong operations. While I have not talked with Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> personally on the
                            subject, I am familiar with the substance of his meetings with the
                            commanders in the Pacific. Further, discussions with General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>'s office and with
                            representatives from the Joint Chiefs' staff have all so far failed to
                            produce an estimate as to when the trend might be reversed.</p>
                        <p>One discussion on March 14 produced a rather interesting thesis that a
                            decisive victory could never be achieved in South Viet Nam and that a
                            Korea-style truce within that country would be the most that could be
                                expected.<note n="2" xml:id="d112fn2">No record of any meeting on
                                March 14 has been found.</note> One basis for this thesis is the
                            policy of dealing, in effect, with each nation in Southeast Asia
                            separately and in differing contexts. The Communists therefore take
                            advantage of our truce efforts in Laos to supply Viet Cong forces in
                            South Viet Nam, even utilizing the sanctuary of Cambodia. Soviet
                            aircraft continue to operate with impunity in this effort. Suggestions
                            have been made that actions be taken against these operations, but State
                            rejects them as “aggressive” and “provocative”. The situation is
                            analogous to that in Korea where Communist forces were supplied from
                            bases just across the Yalu. Under these circumstances and restrictions
                            our efforts in South <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238" facs="0258"/>east Asia
                            will at most be no more conclusive than those in Korea. The costs will
                            probably be comparable, and the President's estimate of a ten-year
                            effort is realistic.</p>

                            people;</p>

                        <p>In the area granted priority, the Plan will establish a firm security
                            system, composed of strategic hamlets and fighting hamlets. Strategic
                            hamlets will be built in places where popular security is adequate.
                            Fighting hamlets will be built in areas that still suffer Viet Cong
                            pressure and control, or in areas permanently threatened by important

                            this reason, isolated hamlets or groups of hamlets which the enemy could
                            exploit or which would be unprotected close to the frontier will not be
                            established.</p>
                        <p>On the provincial level, the Province Chief must put forth a plan for
                            building a system of strategic and fighting hamlets. Only in this

                            neighboring provinces, in order that the interprovincial security system

                        <p>In the defense of the hamlets the large part of the work will be given to

                            close mobile support. However, during the period when fighting hamlets
                            are being built in areas heavily infiltrated by the Viet Cong, the Civil
                            Guard may be temporarily used to replace the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> in the direct defense of hamlets, unti1 such time as

                        <p>1) Urgent distribution of plastic identity cards to the entire population
                            in the area where the security system is being established. The
                            inhabitants of each house will be recorded and photographed' a copy
                            going to each house along with the identity card number. Copies will

                        <p>3) Enforcement of curfew orders on a few waterways in the area of
                            fighting hamlets and other areas, if necessary. Defense forces may fire
                            at sight on anyone breaking the curfew.</p>
                        <p>4) Establish forbidden zones in dense, jungle, and marshy regions, etc… .

                            Permit defense forces to fire at sight on any element penetrating this

                        <p>5) Control of the transportation of paddy, foodstuffs, and articles of a
                            military nature. If it is deemed necessary, transportation by convoy
                            will be enforced, and after the harvest rice will be bought by the
                            Government and collected in a secure place, and will be rationed to

                            policy must be carried out:</p>
                        <p>1) Military and Government cadres must have correct behavior when
                            communicating daily with the people and in every situation. Punitive
                            measures against a village or hamlet will never be taken without the
                            approval of the National Security Council, even if they are legitimate.
                            Great care must be exercised when using bombers or artillery in
                            populated areas, to avoid injuring or killing law-abiding citizens.</p>
                        <p>2) The people must be kept thoroughly informed about the details and
                            purpose of the control measures which they must follow. Once order and
                            security in the area have been re-established, control measures must
                            immediately be eased. In the event that people must be moved to
                            regrouped hamlets, they must also be given every assistance, and at the
                            same time should be informed of the benefits they will receive as a
                            result of the Plan.</p>
                        <p>3) According to the progress made, when a security system has been firmly
                            consolidated and Viet Cong influence has been eliminated in a part of
                            the area, activities on the social and economic side must be begun

                        <p>The Secretary of State at the Presidency, Assistant for National Defense,
                            Charged with Security, shall accept responsibility before the President
                            for the general execution of the Plan.</p>
                        <p>As for the Strategic Hamlet Program, the Secretary of State for the
                            Interior is the Secretary General of the Central Committee, still
                            responsible for the over-all plan.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Article 11. Special Stipulations.</p>
                        <p>The Viet Cong will naturally react strongly to prevent the execution of
                            the Plan, and will concentrate all their force to seek to destroy the
                            Government's efforts, despite some failure at the beginning.</p>
                        <p>Thus, when establishing the security system, the provincial authorities
                            must examine the situation carefully and select the proper time to
                            execute the Plan, i.e., when there are sufficient troops to halt every
                            destructive Communist plot, or encourage the population to oppose the
                            enemy. The more the security system is strengthened, the more will the
                            Viet Cong seek to attack in strength, and at that time the Army will be
                            ready to exterminate the enemy when he concentrates or attacks fighting
                            hamlets.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the determination of priority zones for establishing a security
                            system does not mean that the Viet Cong are free to control other areas.

                        </list>
                        <p>As directed by higher authority, I met with General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> in Saigon on 17 March 1962.
                            After about an hour's conversation, we were joined by Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> gave me a
                            rundown on the inspection tours that he has been conducting since
                            arriving in Saigon. On the whole he feels encouraged. He finds the
                            troops are well-trained, energetic, and vigorous fighters.</p>
                        <p>He reported particularly on some newly organized strategic villages in
                            central South Viet-Nam.<note n="3" xml:id="d114fn3">The value of the
                                strategic village approach is also illustrated by two recent cables.
                                The first is an intelligence report indicating that the arming of a
                                very few villages in the Montagnard District along the infiltration
                                routes has forced the infiltrating Viet Cong to change their routes
                                drastically. The second illustrates the particular importance of
                                village radios. A team distributing radios bumped into a Viet Cong
                                unit, which withdrew towards a village equipped with a radio just 24
                                hours earlier. Alerted by their newly acquired radio, the village
                                Self Defense Corps intercepted the Viet Cong in a highly successful
                                ambush. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> The Viet Cong had
                            attacked one of these villages just the night before, and the
                            Self-Defense Corps had successfully repelled them. The next morning
                            reinforcements were brought up and the Viet Cong suffered heavy
                            casualties.</p>
                        <p>In discussing our general approach in South Viet-Nam, I stressed to both
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> and
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> that the
                            paper entitled <hi rend="italic">

                                South Viet-Nam</hi>

                                <ref target="#d42">Document 42</ref>.</note> was written hastily
                            after only a very short time on the ground; that no one felt that it was
                            the last word on the subject; and that any comments, criticisms, or
                            suggestions that they would have would be most welcome. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> said that for his
                            part he felt that the general approach was sound and that his impression
                            was that the South Vietnamese Government and the people in the American
                            Missions were in substantial agreement with this approach. On the
                            specific recommendations for assigning U.S. personnel to civic action
                            teams and other tasks at the village level, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> with General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>' concurrence suggested that
                            we should not approach President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> with a formal proposal. Rather, we should recommend
                            the assignment of individual Americans to civic action teams and other
                            tasks at the village level only as specific needs arose. For my part I
                            said that I thought that this was by far the best approach. Both
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> and General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> went on to say,
                            though, the assignment of American personnel to civic action teams and
                            village level tasks was necessary and desirable and that the numbers
                            needed were very close to those estimated in the report.</p>
                        <p>At the time of our meeting, President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> had not yet signed the strategic village plan
                            prepared by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName>.<note n="5" xml:id="d114fn5">President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> signed the plan (<ref target="#d113">Document
                                    113</ref>) on March 16, although U.S. representatives did not
                                learn of the signing until March 19.</note> The delay was apparently
                            occasioned not by any reluctance concerning the plan itself but by
                            doubts as to who among the Vietnamese would be in charge of it.</p>
                        <p>The Deputy Chief of Mission was concerned that Brother
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>, who is enthusiastic about the strategic
                            village approach, might attempt to apply it simultaneously all over the
                            country rather than systematically by phases. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>, however, has talked with
                            Brother <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> about this specific question and has
                            gotten some assurances that <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> is aware of the
                            danger of a blanket approach. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> feels that it would be most unwise to raise with
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> any question about
                            Brother <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> at this time.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Operation Sunrise</p>
                        <p>I asked about Operation Sunrise, which calls for building a belt of
                            strategic villages in Binh Duong Province along the road through Ben
                                Cat.<note n="6" xml:id="d114fn6">See <ref target="#d103">Document
                                    103</ref>.</note> This province is flanked by areas of very
                            heavy concentrations of regular Viet Cong units, in Zone D on the one
                            side and Tay Ninh on the other, and is a major route for Viet Cong
                            supplies and troop movements. I said that the strategic village concept
                            called for building <pb n="246" xml:id="pg_246" facs="0266"/>zones of
                            such villages beginning with the less dangerous areas and then fanning
                            outwards, and that my fear was that the Viet Cong would try to make an
                            example of these villages and so discredit the Strategic Village concept
                            throughout South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> said that he,
                            too, was very disturbed about Operation Sunrise. He feared that the
                            troops guarding these very exposed villages would be called away to meet
                            some other threat, giving the Viet Cong precisely the opportunity they
                            seek. Both General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>
                            and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> were
                            pressing <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> to cancel this
                            operation, but they were handicapped by the fact that it was the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> that originally urged it and
                            especially since the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> had
                            previously urged the Zone D operation and then abandoned it. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> said he could
                            only hope that these villages could in fact be protected until the
                            phased plan had begun to work.</p>

                        <p>I find that I am a little uneasy about the way things are going in South
                            Viet-Nam</p>
                        <p rend="center">… … .</p>
                        <p>Secondly, I'm uneasy about the tendency in Washington to attempt to keep
                            the farm gate operations secret. I think it is an impossibility; there
                            are just too many Americans and Vietnamese involved in this particular
                            operation in South Viet-Nam and I think that the solution lies not in
                            trying to keep it hidden but in to using farm gate correctly.</p>
                        <pb n="247" xml:id="pg_247" facs="0267"/>
                        <p>On this latter point, it is perfectly clear that farm gate is still being
                            used on what they call “Interdiction” roles; that is, striking at
                            targets revealed by South Vietnamese intelligence in places where the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> does not have access. A General
                            Jabloski (whom I used to know at West Point) related the following to
                                <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Fritz Nolting</persName>:</p>
                        <p>On several occasions the Viet Cong, after an air strike, have removed
                            their own dead and then laid out in the middle of the street the women
                            and children killed by our air strikes, so that the villagers on

                        <p>Among the Americans in South Viet-Nam, according to <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>, however, there are growing
                            doubts about the utility of farm gate used in this “interdiction” role
                            as opposed to close ground support of units actually in contact with the
                            Viet Cong. However, <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> and the
                            South Vietnamese think it is great stuff and are continually calling for
                            strikes on the basis of the flimsiest kind of intelligence. Our joint
                            air control center has been screening these very carefully but there is
                            still a very large amount of what cannot help but be indiscriminate
                            bombing. The whole business could blow up in any number of horrendous
                            ways.</p>
                        <p>I would like all of you to give some thought to this and how we might
                            intervene either at the White House with Bobby Kennedy or in some other
                            way.</p>

                        <p>Dear Ben: You will no doubt get a copy of the Hickey-Donnell report<note n="2" xml:id="d116fn2">Not found.</note> in due time. I think,
                            however, that you may be interested now <pb n="248" xml:id="pg_248" facs="0268"/>in some of the things they said Friday<note n="3" xml:id="d116fn3">March 16.</note> in a debriefing session at <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>. Their work is not finished, so some
                            of the ideas may be changed by future observations as well as by being
                            filtered through Heavner.</p>
                        <p>The outstanding conclusion seemed to be that strategic hamlets do make
                            for better security, that relocation of the people in strategic hamlets
                            is feasible in general, but that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            is still making many of the errors which characterized the agroville
                            program, i.e. implementing the plan with no regard for the hardships
                            imposed on the local population. Another conclusion was that the people
                            very much need and hope for more agricultural extension assistance from
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. Both Hickey and Donnell seemed
                            to feel that increased agricultural assistance in the form of credit,
                            fertilizer, improved seeds, stock and expert advice are essential to
                            winning over the peasantry.</p>
                        <p>They reported that at Cu Chi in Binh Duong province they found the people
                            openly resentful over the labor and material demands made on them to
                            construct the strategic hamlets there. They learned that although the
                            laborers were supposed to get nominal pay (10 piasters a day), none
                            actually received any money or food, that some had worked as long as 49
                            consecutive days on the project, that many laborers will not live in the
                            hamlet and so derive no personal benefit from the project, that building
                            the hamlet cut deeply into the second crop (tobacco) because they did
                            not have time to plant and water it, and that many were facing genuine
                            economic distress as a result. Hickey and Donnell felt these gripes were
                            quite legitimate.</p>
                        <p>A simple solution here of course is to pay the workers. But this requires
                            piaster resources. Another solution to the Cu Chi problem is suggested
                            by the fact that one area visited is hiring a bulldozer from a nearby
                            plantation to construct the earthworks around the village. In part at
                            least, this could be done with dollars.<note n="4" xml:id="d116fn4">At
                                this point in the source text, a note in an unidentified hand reads:
                                “How about using some of the SDP bulldozers sitting in
                                Saigon?”</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Still another idea is suggested by the fact that Hickey and Donnell saw
                            several variants on the strategic hamlet, some of which are much easier
                            and much less expensive than the Cu Chi model (which is apparently
                            pretty much on the lines of the <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> prototype). In Vinh Long they
                            found strategic hamlets with no encircling fortifications but a
                            “defensive bloc” at or near the center of the hamlet. This bloc was
                            fortified by spike boards and mines made from hand grenades. These could
                            be taken up in the day time. In Kien Hoa, no fortifications are built by
                            the famous Colonel Thao, who thinks they are generally unnecessary. He
                            builds a hamlet office, information post, and guard post and calls it
                            done. He concedes, however, that in some <pb n="249" xml:id="pg_249" facs="0269"/>areas earthworks may be required. His approach is in
                            general much slower than that used at Cu Chi; he is not paying the
                            peasants either, but neither is he applying great pressure.</p>
                        <p>While the rather unhappy picture at Cu Chi is almost certainly quite
                            accurate, I should say I think much of the discontent will wear off if
                            security really improves. (Donnell tentatively agrees.) The Vietnamese
                            are wonderful gripers, and let off steam in the same way our GI's do
                            whenever they catch a sympathetic ear. Also Hickey and Donnell found
                            that in Vinh Long the people generally seemed to like the idea of
                            strategic hamlets, particularly because the better security made it
                            possible for relatives to visit during Tet. And in the Hoa Hao area
                            around Sadec, people seemed almost enthusiastic about the strategic
                            hamlets. This was the only area visited where the people were quite
                            vocal about the hamlets being useful in keeping the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> out. (This suggests to me that there may
                            be more validity than I had supposed in the idea that the Hoa Hao are
                            still an untapped source of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            support.) And even in Cu Chi people liked the fact that the strategic
                            hamlets keep the “agitators” out.</p>
                        <p>Among other interesting observations that emerged is the fact that the
                            NRM and other mass organizations have virtually disappeared in the
                            countryside. The only active <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            organization at the rice roots seems to be the Republican Youth and
                            various auto-defense groups. This is perhaps not altogether bad. The
                            five-family system is not working well because the heads of the family
                            groups often refuse any responsibility (which is not surprising, given
                            the security situation and the rewards of heading the group).</p>
                        <p>A point stressed by the team is the immediate importance of agricultural
                            assistance at hamlet level. In this connection, it is worth repeating
                            Hickey's observation that the peasants do not think in terms of future
                            benefits. Saving is rare in the villages; a good crop simply means
                            larger feasts on the suitable occasions. This means, as <persName corresp="#p_SWA1">Warren</persName> has been saying, that plans for
                            long-range economic development, however well conceived, are far less
                            important in this struggle than rural impact programs.<note n="5" xml:id="d116fn5">At this point in the source text, a note reads:
                                “Hear, hear.”</note> (It is difficult to convince people of this.
                            The fact that a mobile medical team <hi rend="italic">in a hamlet</hi>
                            will be talked about for months even though it helps fewer people less
                            efficiently than building up provincial hospitals is difficult to sell.
                            Medical teams in the villages would have impact. And they would reach
                            people who will never venture near the provincial hospitals for
                            political or financial reasons.)</p>
                        <p>Few peasants actually stated they want increased security and one peasant
                            engaged in constructing a strategic hamlet told the team that she was
                            carrying bamboo to build a fence around “Mr. Communist.”<pb n="250" xml:id="pg_250" facs="0270"/>This seems to point up a failure on the
                            information side. Hickey and Donnell said in response to a question that
                            the population got a week of advance information in Cu Chi before
                            construction started. Colonel Thao generally works them over for three
                            or four weeks, by his own account at least, before setting up a
                            strategic hamlet. This could make quite a difference.</p>
                        <p>Among the team's tentative recommendations is better training and
                            organization for hamlet and village level defense forces and increased
                            salaries (paid on time) for the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> and
                            for village and hamlet chiefs. (Although they did not mention the need
                            for more training of hamlet and village officials, the team did note
                            that no training programs were in evidence except in Kien Hoa, where the
                            wonderful Colonel Thao runs a continuous course for his people which
                            lasts for three and a half months.) They stressed agricultural
                            extension, as noted above, and also approved Colonel Thao's idea of
                            using the old Council of Notables to backstop the village administrative
                            councils in terms of advice, some control, and by lending their prestige
                            to council actions. (Thao is also using the Cult Committees in some way
                            not entirely clear to me.) One idea, also Thao's, that does not seem
                            very convincing is the suggestion that we are overstressing the hamlet
                            at the expense of the village, and that we must decide whether we are
                            going to focus on strengthening the hamlets or the village
                            administrative structure. Thao thinks we are now tending to overstress
                            the hamlet.</p>
                        <p>The team also reported that they never encountered any anti-American
                            feeling. The role of the U.S. is not well understood, however, and the
                            Commie line that we have replaced the French is perhaps making some
                            headway.</p>
                        <p>I am champing at the bit somewhat here in Saigon. While Hickey and
                            Donnell sound very right to me now, I would like to check it out, and
                            hope that <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> will soon name

                                23.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p> Lac is at present Chief of Kienh Province and is highly regarded by
                            Thuan. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> assured us that when
                            Lac is designated he will build on plans already developed by Gen Cao
                            for operations in Bien Duong (Operation Sunrise) rather than starting
                            afresh, and that Lac will maintain close liaison with mission as Cao has
                            done to enable us to advise and assist promptly and effectively.</p>
                        <p>This could be important breakthrough on commencement systematic
                            counterinsurgency operation. <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>
                            had been holding back on signing of Delta Plan directive for about a
                            month, and there was reason to fear that major snag had arisen, possibly
                            in form of some basic disagreement between ministries about fundamentals
                            of plan or who was to carry it out. In particular, there was
                            considerable ground for doubts that Operation Sunrise under General Cao
                            had full support of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> military.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>'s more or less jubilant
                            report on signing of Delta Plan indicates that this problem, if it
                            existed, is resolved. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> is
                            not only Minister of Defense and therefore in a position to give plan
                            necessary military support. He also indicated that he was quite
                            conscious that more forces than presently allotted two battalions are
                            required for Bien Duong operation. He said that he was urging on
                            President desirability of taking regiment from 1st division in north for
                            this operation and substituting for it as military presence on DMZ
                            newly-created 9th division which would carry out its training there. (I
                            have not yet had opportunity to discuss military implications of this
                            with General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>.)</p>
                        <pb n="252" xml:id="pg_252" facs="0272"/>
                        <p>At any rate, decision to move forward on Delta Plan is encouraging
                            development. We should make and are making maximum effort to support it.
                            It is plan with which Task Force Saigon is generally in accord and there
                            will be ample opportunity to support modifications of detail, if
                            required, as operations proceed.</p>

                                <ref target="#d106">Document 106</ref>.</note> In conversation with
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> yesterday, I brought up
                            question of Madame <persName corresp="#p_TLX1">Nhu</persName>'s speech, following same
                            substantive line as protest made by <persName corresp="#p_TWC2">Trueheart</persName> March 13 but indicating also my personal
                            disappointment and concern over statements and stressing problems
                            created for my government in its efforts to help Viet Nam.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> indicated, as he had to
                                <persName corresp="#p_TWC2">Trueheart</persName>, that he personally
                            deplored speech and understood our position. He said that he had
                            discussed protest with <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> who had suggested he
                            reply to the general effect that Madame <persName corresp="#p_TLX1">Nhu</persName> was not
                            speaking for <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> but as head of Women's
                            Solidarity Movement. We should also be aware that in interrogation of
                            Lieutenant Quoc (one of pilots who bombed Palace February 27) it had
                            been brought out that Quoc had stated that he was persuaded to undertake
                            bombing by reading specific paragraphs of <hi rend="italic">Time</hi>
                            and <hi rend="italic">Newsweek</hi> articles which were represented to
                            him as showing that U.S. favored overthrow of regime. (I remarked that
                            this showed <persName corresp="#p_VQT1">Quoc</persName> was naive, but
                            asked for specific citations of paragraphs in question.) With regard to
                            references in speech to U.S. failure to support Civil Guard,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> had said, according to <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>, that there might be two sides to
                            question but <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> was being blamed for
                            insecurity in countryside, and this was blame which must be shared. I
                            replied in effect that question should be discussed privately, not in
                            public speeches.</p>
                        <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0273"/>
                        <p>Turning to what could be done to prevent a recurrence, <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> seemed to think only solution was
                            some procedure for prior clearance of Mme Nhu's speeches. As matters
                            stood, President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s speeches
                            were reviewed by Ministers, Mme Nhu's were not. He suggested that I
                            might speak to <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> about
                            this.</p>
                        <p>I followed up on this with President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> today. He took it in good part, seemed somewhat
                            embarrassed, said that when he had read the speech after Mme Nhu made it
                            he felt that, “while emotionally and perhaps intellectually
                            understandable, it was politically stupid”. I said that I hoped very
                            much, for the sake of our common objectives, there would be no
                            repetition.</p>
                        <p> Mme Nhu has already told AP reporter Brown that her speech was aimed at
                            U.S. press and not at U.S. Government. (According to Brown, she seemed
                            in this interview to be genuinely upset at reaction to speech.)
                            Moreover, as she is about to embark on extensive foreign tour which will
                            reportedly keep her out of country for three or four months, I believe
                            we should now let matter rest.</p>

                            officer had long talk with Canadian Counselor Rettie, who has now
                            studied <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>/Viet-Nam so long and
                            carefully that he understands much of it and therefore may be considered
                            one of small number experts this esoteric subject. His views carry
                            weight with Ambassador Heeney and probably in Ottawa.</p>
                        <p>Following emerged from conversation:</p>
                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>/Viet-Nam should continue.</p>
                        <p>2. As an awkward “early model Troika” <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>/Viet-Nam must not be expected deal successfully with large
                            concepts, legal or otherwise. It responds best to limited stimuli. Thus
                            we should not openly make sweeping statements to effect:</p>
                        <pb n="254" xml:id="pg_254" facs="0274"/>
                        <p>a. We will give no more notification.</p>
                        <p>b. Breach by one side justify non-observance by the other. Difficulty
                            here compounded by fact we had used <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            breach cease-fire (articles 19, 24, etc.) as justification bringing in
                            men and material (articles 16 and 17). Rettie unable find clear
                            precedents in international law to effect breach one part a treaty by a
                            party justified non-observance other parts treaty by other party.</p>
                        <p>3. Rettie also made plea that our actions should not be too sweeping,
                            e.g., avoid upsetting <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> equanimity by
                            spectacle scores US helicopters on dock opposite Majestic Hotel
                            (Department officer commented <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>
                            eyesight seemed far more acute Saigon than in Hanoi where after 15
                            months airlift apparently still not visible).</p>
                        <p>4. Rettie again confirmed that Canadian strategy on <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> would continue to be one of attempting
                            persuade Indians rather than taking obdurate position to counterbalance
                            Poles.</p>
                        <p> Rettie then gave advance indication favorable <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> action re subversion (Saigon's 1157).<note n="3" xml:id="d119fn3">Dated March 9, not printed. (Department of State,

                        <p>The current plans and programs for Civic Action in Vietnam, which
                            Sterling <persName corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName> is bringing
                            back from his visit to <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>, will
                            need evaluation by the Special Group (<gloss target="#t_CI1">CI</gloss>).<note n="2" xml:id="d122fn2">See <ref target="#d123">Document 123</ref>.</note> The following is a suggested
                            yardstick for measuring Civic Action in Vietnam, based upon my
                            experience in developing the initial Civic Action programs in the
                            Philippines and Vietnam, and helping initiate Civic Action in Laos and
                            Burma.</p>
                        <p>The essentials needed in Vietnam's Civic Action program now, I believe,
                            are:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">To provide the means for the VN military to earn the
                                friendship of the people.</hi> These can be simple actions which
                            show that the troops really care for the people they are protecting. The
                            U.S. military program should be mostly one of promoting me proper
                            attitude in the VN soldier. Troop brotherliness towards the people
                            speaks louder than planned propaganda or big projects with bulldozers
                            and gimmicks. These actions are such things as willing care for wounded
                            and injured civilians, sharing rice with the hungry, repairing destroyed
                            public structures, and starting public services such as schools, pure
                            water supply, sanitation, etc. These are quick, natural actions which
                            the soldier does when he has a moment from his primary security mission.
                            Its effectiveness is measured in the increase of combat intelligence
                            voluntarily given by the villagers helped.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">To make the village a dynamic, willing part of free
                                Vietnam.</hi> We need the whole countryside with us, not just a few
                            fortified areas and cities. The people need something demonstrably worth
                            defending. When the VN government shows up in a village, it shouldn't
                            just teach village defense and collect taxes. The villagers need a sense
                            of participation in something greater than their own local spot, and a
                            sharing in both the benefits and responsibilities of free citizenship,
                            as well as their action's future. The civilian Civic Action teams must
                            set the example by being public servants in the best sense—including
                            getting their hands calloused by helping people. I believe the Civic
                            Action teams should develop national spirit at the village level, by <pb n="257" xml:id="pg_257" facs="0277"/>fundamental democracy in the
                            villages, including electing most village officials by secret ballot,
                            establish primary education, and start linking up the village
                            spiritually as well as mentally (information programs) and physically
                            (roads, landing strips) with the provincial and national centers. The
                            Civic Action teams will earn their influence with the villagers to
                            accomplish the above by really helping initiate public services (which
                            is where health, communications, etc., assistance comes in).</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">To establish a permanent governmental
                            structure</hi>. Civic Action should be seen as a contingency means
                            towards creating a going concern, where Civic Action teams are no longer
                            needed. Thus, the Civic Action teams need to be fielded by all
                            service-type national Ministries (Health, Agriculture, etc.) and work to
                            build a modest permanent organization under each Province Chief so that
                            the national government has roots throughout the country, responsive to
                            the people. This requires a Civic Action chief at the national level
                            able to levy requirements on a number of Ministries (as did Vietnam's
                            first Civic Action chief), to increase the executive assets of Province
                            Chiefs, and to inspire dedicated public service in his teams with a
                            minimum of bureaucracy. The teams should be able to get a village on its
                            feet as a good member of the national community, and then move on. Team
                            members themselves used recognition, in terms of preferred civil service
                            in Ministries or provincial governments at the end of their field
                            duty.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">To help the people help themselves.</hi> This must
                            not be simple dogoodism. The real value of Civic Action is in helping
                            the people to help themselves. Villagers will proudly maintain the road
                            they helped to build themselves, where they are indifferent to
                            maintaining a similar road built by the Army or other government
                            organization. As the people create a better life, with government
                            encouragement and help, they both find a closer bond with that
                            government and build something worth risking life to defend. Further, as
                            this progresses, people start providing true security in an area, and
                            troops can be removed from static defense into mobile striking
                            forces.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation.</p>
                        <p>The best way for the Special Group (<gloss target="#t_CI1">CI</gloss>) to
                            get a meaningful Civic Action program under way fast in Vietnam would be
                            to approve Defense and <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> selecting one
                            experienced officer each to be responsible for U.S. participation in
                            Civic Action in Vietnam, team them up in Washington, and then send them
                            soonest to Vietnam to get a practical organization and program started.
                            There are several U.S. military officers who have proven themselves in
                            Civic Action in Southeast Asia. <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> was
                            planning to use Bert Fraley in <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>
                            counter-insurgency. Two “right” people, supported properly, could get
                            more done with <pb n="258" xml:id="pg_258" facs="0278"/>what is already
                            available in Vietnam in one day on the spot than could days of further
                            study by others. The two could quickly plan a really practical program,
                            a realistic organization, and do more than that—get some willing
                            cooperation from the Vietnamese government.</p>

                        <p>The Department of Army Civil Affairs Team surveyed the situation in 1961
                            and presented their report with recommendations on December 12. After
                            review by <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> it was submitted to

                            has been made. The principal recommendations of this report are:</p>
                        <p>1. The <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> should be inculcated with
                            the belief that the war cannot be won in Viet-Nam if the villagers are
                            antagonized by <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> hostile attitudes
                            and treatment.</p>
                        <p>2. Villagers should be assisted on Civic Action projects by <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> teams.</p>
                        <pb n="259" xml:id="pg_259" facs="0279"/>
                        <p>3. Civic Action teams should be trained to conduct resettlement of
                            villagers into strategic villages.</p>
                        <p>4. Teams should be trained to assume civil government functions in areas
                            recovered from the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> until turned back
                            to civilian control.</p>

                            achieve objectives in No. 1 above.</p>
                        <p>2. Vietnamese leaders such as “Big Minh” have publicly stated and have
                            issued orders to <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> troops that their
                            conduct vis-à-vis the villagers must be changed.</p>
                        <p>3. General <persName corresp="#p_TMGC1">Timmes</persName> reported in

                        <p>4. Five 20-man Civic Action teams are now in the field working on

                        <p>The Civic Action of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is centered
                            in the Ministry of Civic Action which was created in 1961. Since a
                            number of other ministries of the government provide assets in Civic
                            Action, a coordination of the effort was vested by <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> in an Interministerial Committee
                            for Secure Hamlets on February 3. This Committee is charged with
                            coordinating the Civic Action program throughout the country and has
                            among its objectives the setting up of 8000 strategic hamlets in the
                            next two years, strengthening them with socio-economic services and
                            facilities.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> has given the
                            highest priority to the construction of these strategic hamlets which
                            will constitute the hub of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> Civic
                            Action effort. Minister Hieu now has over 600 cadre operating singly and

                        <p>The following items developed at the Honolulu conference are of special
                            interest.</p>
                        <p>a. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> has asked
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> to continue
                            with the crop defoliation program and to provide helicopters to his
                            province chiefs. In the first instance, General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> recommends using defoliants
                            on a selected basis for crop denial. <gloss target="#t_SecDef1">SecDef</gloss> said he would try to obtain Washington concurrence
                            in delegating some authority to Saigon for defoliation operations of
                            this type. On the second matter, General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> suggested that H-19's now being declared surplus
                            by the Vietnamese could be turned over to the province chiefs. <gloss target="#t_SecDef1">SecDef</gloss> concurred.</p>
                        <p>b. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> said
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> has approved a border
                            patrol. Discussion indicated this referred to 20 base camps along the
                            Lao border and 68 along the Cambodian border, many of which are already
                            established. They will be manned by 10 <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> and 13 Montagnard ranger companies. (An earlier report
                            indicated that 5,000 personnel would be assigned to this type of border
                            patrol. There has been no mention of means of mobility nor of
                            organization for command and control. This project should be
                            investigated further to determine if it really supports the purpose of
                            your recommendation and does not, in fact, tie down additional troops in
                            static positions. I am checking it out through the TF.)</p>
                        <p>c. There was discussion as to the advantages and disadvantages of arming
                            helicopters. Admiral Felt was opposed; General <persName corresp="#p_DGH1">Decker</persName> was in favor. Although the
                            matter was brought up in only general terms <gloss target="#t_SecDef1">SecDef</gloss> suggested the disagreements indicated there was a
                            problem. He asked General <persName corresp="#p_DGH1">Decker</persName>
                            to determine what was required and to make recommendations to him.</p>
                        <p>d. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> said that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> had directed that strategic hamlets, being
                            built in all provinces now, are to be completed as soon as possible. The
                            Ambassador commented that this objective may be optimistic in terms of
                            the projected availability of troops to provide required protection.</p>
                        <pb n="262" xml:id="pg_262" facs="0282"/>
                        <p>e. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> stated that
                            the training of civil guard and self-defense corps personnel not yet
                            trained will be completed by the end of 1962. Efforts are continuing to
                            increase the capacity of existing training sites.</p>
                        <p>f. <gloss target="#t_SecDef1">SecDef</gloss> asked what percent of the
                                <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> was armed. No one present knew.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> commented
                            that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> reluctance to issue weapons to
                            the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> reflected some doubt as to the
                            loyalty of those troops. <gloss target="#t_SecDef1">SecDef</gloss> said
                            we cannot let 50,000 to 60,000 <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>
                            remain unarmed or ineffective (with old French arms) and asked General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> to look into this
                            matter. (This is related to carbine issue to <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>.)</p>
                        <p>g. Capability to resist subversion in Thailand was discussed. There was
                            agreement that military capabilities are improving. The question of
                            providing a Thai airborne unit was discussed at some length. There was
                            some difference of opinion whether to convert existing non-airborne
                            units or to form an entirely new unit. In view of the under strength
                            status of the Thai Army, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> recommended conversion although the Thais desire a
                            new unit. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> did
                            not consider this an urgent problem but, based on a counter-argument by
                            General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName>, agreed to
                            review the entire problem including supporting airlift.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> reported that he
                            had directed Chief JUSMAAG to move ahead on a Central Intelligence
                            Organization for Thailand. He had just received a message from
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> indicating
                            nonconcurrence on the basis that this was premature and not yet required
                            in Thailand. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName>
                            said that … is resisting the idea and is influencing the Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>h. There was a broad discussion of both military and <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> communications systems in Thailand.
                            Proposed systems would connect Udorn and Okinawa by 31 March 62, and
                            Ubon with Pleiku, Bangkok, and Saigon by 1 Sep 62. These systems would
                            require about 450 additional US personnel to operate the several links
                            envisaged. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> has
                            not agreed to these personnel increases; <gloss target="#t_SecDef1">SecDef</gloss> said he would authorize the introduction of a radio
                            relay company (350 men) for a period of one year to fill personnel needs
                            until the Thais develop a requisite capability. He asked Mr.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> to follow up with State to gain
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName>'s concurrence.
                                <gloss target="#t_SecDef1">SecDef</gloss> further requested a list
                            of <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> communication projects in
                            Thailand so that he could consult with State and avoid long-term delays
                            which have occurred in Viet-Nam. He indicated <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> could subcontract to Defense in order to get the job
                            done.</p>
                        <p>i. <gloss target="#t_SecDef1">SecDef</gloss> asked General <persName corresp="#p_ABGRH1">Anthis</persName> how important it is for US
                            pilots to continue to fly Jungle Jim aircraft after Viet-Nam pilots have
                            been trained. General <persName corresp="#p_ABGRH1">Anthis</persName> said it was very important in order to continue
                            learning about counter-insurgency operations and to monitor <pb n="263" xml:id="pg_263" facs="0283"/>Vietnamese proficiency. <gloss target="#t_SecDef1">SecDef</gloss> pointed out the need to plan for
                            the increased close air support capability which will exist in June as a
                            result of present training and provision of additional aircraft;
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> cautioned
                            that we should be sure of the political effect before stepping up air
                            operations beyond the current level.</p>
                        <p>j. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> reported
                            there is unanimous opinion that the five-man US advisory team for each
                                <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> battalion is too large. There
                            should be one Captain and two Sergeants per battalion and four
                            Lieutenants per regiment for observers. <gloss target="#t_SecDef1">SecDef</gloss> concurred.</p>
                        <p>k. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> indicated
                            the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> program was being modified to
                            emphasize short-range impact programs. He said the big problem was
                            getting things done through the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>l. <gloss target="#t_SecDef1">SecDef</gloss> said this would be the last
                            conference but that he expected to be in Saigon in May.</p>

                            Implications of U.S. Force Buildup in Vietnam</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> said that State had
                            placed this item on the agenda in order to cite the concern of Indian
                            and Canadian <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> representatives over
                            the open introduction of unconcealed military equipment into Saigon.
                            They have asked that we reduce this activity insofar as practicable.
                            They have stated that they know what we are doing and desire to be
                            helpful. However, it would be advantageous to all if we could avoid
                            flaunting our deliveries to Saigon. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> said that we realize Saigon is the only good
                            port and that we must continue to use it. He asked if it would be
                            possible to fly in the Marine helicopter squadron which is due to be
                            delivered by April 15. This would be far less conspicuous than ship
                            delivery to Saigon. General LeMay said <pb n="264" xml:id="pg_264" facs="0284"/>that we can take some actions, but not a whole lot, to
                            avoid the problem. He added that people appear to be much more sensitive
                            to our actions than they do to those of the Soviet side.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> said that the
                            President had taken a positive decision on our position on the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>. This matter was discussed thoroughly
                            and he had decided that we would recognize the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> and we would not renounce the accords. We would just
                            act in the face of them and this causes problems like the present one… .
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> then said that he
                            would like to have JCS agreement to the following paragraph in a
                            proposed message to Ottawa, New Delhi and Saigon. “We will henceforth
                            avoid open and flagrant introduction of personnel and equipment such as
                            unloading unconcealable military equipment in Saigon which have not been
                            notified to <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> so as to avoid charges
                            of violations of Agreement. In this regard we understand fourth
                            helicopter squadron can fly into Vietnam and need not be unloaded in
                                Saigon.”<note n="2" xml:id="d126fn2">The original draft of telegram
                                1137 to Saigon (<ref target="#d130">Document 130</ref>) included
                                this statement as paragraph 2. (Briefing material for Under
                                Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>, March 22,
                                Department of State, State-JCS Meetings: Lot 65 D 172)</note>
                            Admiral Ricketts said that this was a good objective and the JCS would
                            do their best to meet it. However, no specific commitments could be
                            made. He added that the only dock in Saigon was situated just in front
                            of the Imperial Hotel.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName> indicated that most
                            of the objectionable heavy equipment had already been delivered and that
                            the remaining immediate project which could cause trouble was the Marine
                            helicopter squadron. General <persName corresp="#p_SGDM1">Shoup</persName> said that this squadron was in the Philippines and
                            that if it is the one to go to Vietnam it can be flown in from as far
                            out at sea as fuel capacity will permit. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RVAHD1">Riley</persName> said that the language of the
                            proposed cable must be altered since it would tie the hands of the
                            military. General <persName corresp="#p_DGH1">Decker</persName> said
                            that the JCS would ask Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> to act to meet our objectives in the delivery
                            program to Vietnam. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>
                            agreed with General <persName corresp="#p_DGH1">Decker</persName>'s
                            observation that the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> was spending
                            too much time in Saigon and not enough time in Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> asked if the group would
                            like to spend a moment discussing rules of engagement<note n="3" xml:id="d126fn3">Not found.</note> for the four F-102 aircraft being
                            deployed to Vietnam for possible employment against intruder aircraft.
                            General LeMay said that the proposed rules were such that if any
                            intruders were shot down it would be a sheer accident. He pointed out
                            that the identification procedures were impossible to comply with at
                            night. General <persName corresp="#p_DGH1">Decker</persName> said that
                            the rules were drafted by <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>
                            and the JCS would have to work out the problem with that Hq. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> asked if the F-102
                            could actually shoot down the slow-moving, low-flying intruders and
                            General LeMay said that they could. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>
                            <pb n="265" xml:id="pg_265" facs="0285"/> said that we must not attack
                            commercial aircraft. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>
                            said that the F-102s could not be employed against the intruders without
                            reference back to the President.</p>

                        <p>The main political factors bearing on the question of who is winning the
                            war in Viet-Nam, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> or the Viet
                            Cong, relate to organization and working methods of the Government,
                            establishment of non-Communist unity against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, and winning the positive support of the mass of the
                            people in the countryside. These are the political factors which were
                            stressed by the U.S. Government at the highest levels following the
                            visit to Viet-Nam by the <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> Mission in October 1961.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Organization</p>
                        <p>Organization and working methods constitute one of the essential keys to
                            success against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. There is no
                            question but that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> has
                            established an extremely efficient organization for the conduct of the
                            war on the Communist side, and is carrying on the war most successfully
                            despite the difficult self-imposed handicap of clandestinity. To counter
                            this ruthless efficiency requires a properly functioning administration
                            on the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> side involving delegation of
                            authority and the use of working methods which encourage subordinates to
                            do the job properly. Ineffectiveness in administration at the national
                            level, in <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0286"/>carrying out the
                            central functions of the government and in extending services to the

                            main weaknesses.</p>
                        <p>Some progress had been made prior to the February 27 bombing of the
                            Palace in improving the organization and operations of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, but the renewed mistrust flowing from
                            that incident will very likely slow down progress again. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> revived the National Internal Security
                            Council in December 1961, and has made limited use of it since that
                            time. Intelligence has probably reflected most progress
                            administratively, with the delegation of some real authority starting
                            about November 1961 to the Director of the <gloss target="#t_CIO1">CIO</gloss> and the concurrent naming of him as Chief of the <gloss target="#t_NPSS1">NPSS</gloss>. In the military field, naval and air
                            force representation has been added to the Joint General Staff, but
                            there has been little in the way of effective improvement in the
                            authority delegated to the Field Command for the conduct of military
                            counterinsurgency operations. On the question of systematic area
                            pacification, <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>, after more
                            than a month's delay, has signed the General Directive for the Delta

                                <ref target="#d113">Document 113</ref>.</note> but has not yet
                            signed the various Instruction on Coordination, Population Controls,
                            Strategic Hamlets, etc., designed to implement the General Directive.
                            There has also been confusion as to who is actually to be in charge of
                            this operation—General Cao (who has been handling it to date) or Colonel
                            Y (the Director of <gloss target="#t_CIO1">CIO</gloss>) and an assistant
                            (whom the President may be intending to name as officials in charge of
                            pacification). It is likewise not clear whether the military have been
                            directed to give adequate support to the pacification of the first
                            province in which the Plan is being put into execution.</p>
                        <p>Because of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> reticence U.S.-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> cooperation on the civilian side has
                            not developed extensively in the sense of direct assignment of U.S.
                            advisors to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> agencies, except in the
                            intelligence field. The cooperative effort represented by the joint
                            provincial surveys has had success in carrying out the survey of three
                            provinces, but this project has not been pushed on the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> side (perhaps because of personnel
                            shortages) as rapidly as we would like, nor has the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> (because of <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s opposition) permitted the coverage in the
                            political and economic fields which we had hoped for.</p>

                        <p>Over recent months the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has taken a
                            series of mobilization measures to increase popular participation in the
                            war effort and improve the morale of the armed forces. Specific measures
                            have included the drafting of educated persons for officer training, the
                            institution of women's military training (the thrust of which is,
                            however, open to <pb n="267" xml:id="pg_267" facs="0287"/>considerable
                            question), limited military training for civil servants in Saigon and
                            other cities, similar training for the members of the youth
                            organizations in various areas, increased pay or allowances to the
                            lowest two ranks in the armed forces and the Civil Guard, reduction of
                            the period in which a drafting stays in conscript status before
                            attaining the status of a regular soldier, the creation of <gloss target="#t_NCO1">NCO</gloss> ranks in the Self Defense Corps,
                            legislation establishing employment preference for veterans both in the
                            Government and in private business, the establishment of a program for
                            the training and employment of disabled veterans, and proposed measures
                            to help war widows and orphans.</p>
                        <p>Steps have also been taken over recent months to establish the National
                            Economic Council, the Constitutional Court, and provincial councils. The
                            National Economic Council has served as a sounding board for the opinion
                            of both trade unions and employers, and in a step in the right direction
                            of freer expression and greater sense of participation. The
                            Constitutional Court has had no noticeable effect. Since the provincial
                            councils are just in the process of establishment, it is too early to
                            determine whether they will have any political impact.</p>
                        <p>The educated classes continue to present an unresolved political problem
                            which is of importance for several reasons: (1) The Government needs all
                            available talent to fight the war against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> has urged the members of this class to offer
                            their services to the Government in this emergency. However, because of
                            their political dissatisfaction with the <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> Government and their belief that their services are
                            not wanted, there is a tendency among many of them to sit on their hands
                            (just as many Vietnamese did during the Indochina war when they did not
                            like either political alternative—the Communists or the French). (2) The
                            dissatisfaction among the educated classes tends to influence the masses
                            at least toward apathy in the present struggle. This influence is
                            attributable to the special position which the intellectual or scholar
                            occupies among the larger masses of the people in a Confucian society
                            like that in Viet-Nam. (3) Perhaps most important of all, the educated
                            class exerts a strong, probably predominant influence on international
                            opinion because of the tendency of the foreign press to accept this
                            class's judgment of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> rather than
                            the official views which we and the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            put forth. Therefore, what the educated class thinks about the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is an important factor influencing the
                            degree of international support which the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will get in its fight against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Various possible measures might be taken by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to develop a more favorable attitude on the part of the
                            educated class. For example, liberation of non-Communist political
                            prisoners, greater freedom of the press and assembly, allowing the
                            National Assembly to become <pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0288"/>more of a real parliamentary body rather than a puppet organization,
                            and the authorization of opposition parties to operate. None of these
                            measures has been taken to date by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>There are no indications that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> have
                            made any material political headway themselves among this class by the
                            use of the “national liberation front” tactic.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Winning the Support of the Villagers</p>
                        <p>The first essentia1 for this purpose is to provide the villagers with a
                            minimum of effective protection against <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> terror and pressures. Only with this can the Government
                            hope to obtain the cooperation and intelligence of the villagers.
                            Systematic planning and execution of the strategic hamlet program,
                            coupled with the development of paramilitary forces in adequate numbers
                            and kinds, should restore a sense of security among the villagers. It is
                            not certain, however, that these programs will be developed
                            systematically since <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>'s pushing could well lead
                            to overhasty, ill-advised development by officials at all levels in a
                            manner which would alienate rather than gain the support of the people.
                            In addition, there is the danger that <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>'s
                            attempted use of the strategic hamlet program for a “revolutionary
                            change of society” at the hamlet level could lead to further division
                            among the population at the time when the aim should be to establish
                            unity. (In control Viet-Nam <persName corresp="#p_NDC1">Ngo Dinh
                                Can</persName>'s pragmatic approach (as opposed to
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>'s theoretical approach) may enable the
                            hamlet defense program to be carried out without giving rise to the
                            risks described above.) The SEC training and equipment program now being
                            carried out is vitally related to this matter of giving the villagers
                            protection, but it appears a considerably greater pare-military force
                            will be required in order to provide each hamlet with a defense force
                            capable of dealing with small <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> groups
                            and of trying to hold off larger groups until help can arrive from the
                            Civil Guard and the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Economic and social development of the villages is also essential in
                            order to gain the positive support of the villagers as opposed to apathy
                            on their part. The specific goals of such a program were outlined in the
                            Joint U.S.-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> Communiqué of January 4,
                                1962.<note n="4" xml:id="d127fn4">See <ref target="#d4">Document
                                    4</ref>.</note> Much has already been accomplished in the fields
                            of agricultural credit, education, health, etc., and what is now aimed
                            for is extension of most of these programs to cover every village. USOM
                            has established an organizaniona1 set-up designed to facilitate
                            implementation of this program by backing up civic action cadres with
                            training, advice and supplies, and the question now is whether the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> can also be organized for rapid,
                            prompt implementation. General Cao has been training and using rural
                            rehabilitation teams since July 1961, for the <pb n="269" xml:id="pg_269" facs="0289"/>development of strategic hamlets in the
                            provinces just north of Saigon, and is expanding these teams in
                            connection with the Delta Pacification Plan. These teams have some
                            socio-economic flavor, though probably not sufficient at present. <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> expects to be able to work directly
                            with General Cao's organization in the socio-economic field, but Cao
                            will still need the cooperation and resources of the various Ministries
                            of the Government in this field. No effective coordinating organization
                            exists as yet for the village socio-economic program in other areas,
                            including those which are relatively white. An interministerial
                            committee on strategic hamlets was established at the beginning of
                            February, and it may turn out to be the coordinating mechanism in the
                            economic and social fields as well, but this is not yet clear.</p>
                        <p>On the political and psychological side, various actions are also
                            desirable to counter the effect of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            propaganda. Payment of the salaries of village officials, now often
                            enough not met because of the inability of the village to collect taxes,
                            is necessary. The Minister of Interior is now understood to be making
                            Central Government resources available for this purpose, and to be
                            checking to see whether the funds furnished are actually being used to
                            pay the salaries of village officials. This requires further checking
                            (perhaps during province surveys) to determine actual status. The
                            Government also needs an effective information program at the rural
                            level, but it is doubtful that this can be mounted as long as the
                            ineffectual Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName> remains
                            Director General of Information. The Government also faces the major
                            obstacle of the skepticism and disbelief of the populace in what the
                            Government says. Therefore, the only information program likely to
                            succeed is one based on concrete accomplishments by the Government in
                            the security, economic and social fields, thus restoring credibility in
                            the Government's word. Aside from that, the information program should
                            explain the record for population control measures, as well as
                            continuing to paint the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> in their real
                            colors.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps most important of all in the political sense for generating mass
                            support are inspired leadership from the top in the Government and the
                            creation of a politically attractive public image. The President
                            continues to travel in rural areas, but the security shield necessary
                            during these trips vitiates much of the favorable impact. Efforts have
                            been made for years to induce the President to make frequent use of
                            radio for popular talks, since this would reach a much vaster audience
                            in the rural areas than his trips, but thus far there has been no real
                            success. Continuing effort is also required to induce the President to
                            switch his theme in rural areas from sacrifice and discipline to that of
                            improvement in security and living standards with the help of the
                            Government. In other words, the theme needs to be what the Government
                            can do to help the people (together with their own efforts) and not what
                            the people should do for the Government. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has also <pb n="270" xml:id="pg_270" facs="0290"/>seriously weakened its domestic position by publicly airing imaginary
                            or historical differences with the U.S., its principal source of
                            military and economic aid and international support.</p>

                        <p>Aside from the economic and social programs at the village level
                            discussed above, other economic factors are also important in the war

                            rests on the well-to-do, who are, by and large, the heaviest consumers
                            of imports. This step was designed to enable the Government to expand
                            the piastre resources available for both security and socio-economic
                            programs. The amount of piastres which will be generated for this
                            purpose will be determined by the level of imports, which in turn
                            depends upon the demand of a free market. <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> activities in the countryside have tended to cause this
                            demand to contract somewhat over the past year or more. There will
                            probably be no permanent change in this trend until security begins to
                            be restored systematically in the countryside. The markets in Saigon and
                            in the provincial centers, and in many villages, are well stocked with
                            both domestic and imported goods; prices on the whole are stable; and
                            deficiency of imports in no way inhibits the current snuggle.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s efforts to collect internal
                            taxes on land, on incomes, and from various excise measures are being
                            intensified, and the realities of their financial situation are bound to
                            require internal borrowing as well, a course on which the Government has
                            decided.</p>
                        <p>For the first time the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is launching
                            an appreciable deficit financing; in the past two months it has borrowed
                            VN$1 billion from the National Bank, borrowing of some VN$800 million by
                            the Industrial Development Center from the National Bank (to help
                            finance the 5/7 tax or capital/equipment) is expected during 1962, and
                            the 1962 budget is expected to result in a deficit of VN$2.5 to 3.0
                            billion out of total expenditures of VN$23.4 billion. Most recent
                            proposals imply an additional deficit of VN$700 million by June 30,
                            1962, from a further increase in the military budget. Thus, a minimum
                            deficit of VN$3.0 billion seems indicated for 1962. As against the
                            VN$37.2 billion total money and credit outstanding on December 30, 1961,
                            this means an increase of some $75. Also, an expected decrease in
                            minimum bank reserve requirements with the National Bank may permit
                            expansion of bank credit by as much as VN$3 billion. Indeed, the new
                            effective exchange rate requires a considerable increase in bank
                            credit-which, however, should be largely siphoned off as taxes.</p>

                        <p>Yet most expert observers believe that the economy can stand this
                            increase without serious inflation. In the first place, all evidence of
                            the past several years points to a very low velocity of money
                            circulation, and hence a low multiplier effect.<note n="5" xml:id="d127fn5">Next to this sentence were written the words “Not

                            there were indications of hoarding money. Secondly, the exchange black
                            market is affected more by security conditions than economic conditions,
                            and there has been virtually no forward speculation in exchange or
                            conditions in anticipation of devaluation. Third, the modest price
                            increases of imported goods were caused by tax increases, not
                            speculative demand or inflationary pressure. Food staple prices, which
                            were sensitive to <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> disturbances and the
                            Mekong flood in the final quarter of 1961, and which mean more than
                            imported goods to the masses, are continuing their normal downward
                            seasonal trend. And the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> for the
                            first time is building reserve rice stocks as a result of better
                            organized commercial paddy collection price guarantees, and imports from
                            America. Fourth, there are sound implications that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is continuing to grow, as well as
                            population (thus offsetting the expected increase in money supply).
                            Finally, the economy is becoming increasingly monetized.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are engaged in a battle for rice, the main crop of South
                            Viet-Nam. <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> control of extensive rural
                            areas, their ability to blackmail peasants everywhere in the Delta, and
                            their harassment of communication lines, cut down rice shipments to
                            Saigon over the past two years, with the result that Viet-Nam, which is
                            normally a rice exporting country, is this year now importing rice. The
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has been having a fair success,
                            however, in the battle over the past three or four months for the rice
                            harvest in the Mekong Delta area, with the result that rice deliveries
                            to Saigon have improved. Unless these deliveries can be maintained at a
                            more satisfactory level, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will be
                            loath to export rice, and it may face a shortage next summer in Saigon
                            and Central Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> have the capability of bringing
                            about major disruption in rubber production and exports, but up to date
                            have refrained from exercising this capability. Since rubber is
                            Viet-Nam's major foreign exchange earner, and a fall in exports would
                            seriously embarrass the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, it must be
                            assumed that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are not interfering
                            with rubber because of funds which they collect from rubber plantations
                            or because of their belief in ultimate victory and the desire to avoid
                            destruction of the asset which the rubber trees represent.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> activities have totally disrupted the
                            trade in cinnamon, which was once a significant export.</p>
                        <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272" facs="0292"/>
                        <p>The other side of the economic coin is the ability of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> to obtain necessary supplies from the
                            people and their levying of taxes on the people. There is not question
                            that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> live off the land, and the
                            greatest hope of gradually squeezing them in this respect is through the
                            strategic hamlets program. Denial of food to the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> through this program ought eventually be relatively
                            successful in Central Viet-Nam and the provinces north of Saigon, but
                            the prospects are considerably less bright in the food-rich Mekong Delta
                            provinces.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">6. Conclusions</p>
                        <p>a. One of the main weaknesses of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            in its ineffectiveness in administration at the National level, is
                            carrying out the control functions of government and in extending
                            services to the countryside.</p>
                        <p>b. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> programs in rural areas—the
                            strategic hamlet program and village-level economic and social
                            developments-aim in the right direction, but depend upon effective
                            implementation for success in restoring security to the villages and
                            winning the support of the villagers.</p>
                        <p>c. The present <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> theme in rural areas
                            “sacrifice and discipline” is not winning the support of the people and
                            should be changed to “improvement in security and living standards with
                            the help of the government.” Any rural information program to be
                            successful must be based on concrete security and socio-economic
                            achievements.</p>
                        <p>d. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is short of trained personnel to
                            carry out its political, economic and psychological programs in the
                            countryside at all levels. However, because of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> reticence U.S.-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            cooperation on the civilian side has not developed extensively in the
                            sense of direct assignment of U.S. advisers to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> civilian agencies at all levels.</p>
                        <p>e. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is doing little to develop a
                            favorable attitude on the part of the educated class, who have some
                            influence on the masses of the people and considerable influence on the
                            international opinion of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>f. Confronted with the efficient military, political and propaganda
                            attack of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has not yet organized an effective
                            set-up to deal with the insurgency, nor has it taken the actions
                            necessary to establish unity and win the support of the people in this
                            fight. Unless the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> develops a
                            coordinated system of government among all fields (security, political,
                            economic and psychological) at all levels from top to bottom, prompt to
                            act and aimed at winning the people, it <pb n="273" xml:id="pg_273" facs="0293"/>will not be able to turn the insurgency tide which has

                            associated directly with the paper; one related to the paper
                            indirectly.</p>
                        <pb n="277" xml:id="pg_277" facs="0297"/>
                        <p>2. As a general proposition, I consider General <persName corresp="#p_LEG1">Lansdale</persName>'s appraisal of the
                            Vietnamese civic action problem to be exactly on target. He has
                            described the basic need accurately; and his direct action program,
                            embracing the dispatch of a skilled and objective team, will achieve
                            results.</p>
                        <p>3. Beyond this, I believe it well to reflect that even the most effective
                            results-and I believe these will be achieved through the program
                            suggested by <persName corresp="#p_LEG1">Lansdale</persName>—will
                            be far from dramatic. What we face is an urgent need to reverse a basic
                            oriental conception—that the dignity of the common man is unimportant
                            and that his basic rights are few. Heavy-handed conduct on the part of
                            the soldiery is the normal thing in Asia. A lack of fiscal integrity on
                            the part of officials is wide-spread, and generally accepted.
                            Regrettably, these things are deeply ingrained in the fabric of the very
                            people whom it is so important that we influence—the military, the
                            police, and the minor officialdom. Thus, it is that the best we do will
                            be none too good, inasmuch as it runs counter to the instincts of those
                            with whom we must deal. Nevertheless, this is still the essence of civic
                            action; and the best way to get on with it will be, as <persName corresp="#p_LEG1">Lansdale</persName> says, to procure the
                            total services of a few people who are enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and
                            oriented directly toward the project.</p>
                        <p>4. Such a proposal as General <persName corresp="#p_LEG1">Lansdale</persName> makes brings to my mind the multitude of
                            similar good ideas which can well up through the Special Group—or could
                            do so, were we properly organized for the task. In this regard, I am
                            mindful of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s
                            expression of concern as to whether or not we are properly organized for
                            counterinsurgency, Model 1962. I would like to address the problem
                            here.</p>
                        <p>5. To begin with, and in the face of speeches to the contrary, the
                            counterinsurgency issue that faces us today <hi rend="italic">is</hi>
                            different, is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> compatible with existing
                            organizational concepts, <hi rend="italic">does</hi> need a fresh
                            look.</p>
                        <p>6. This is true because our insurgency misery is a Communist creation,
                            one designed on a pattern that does not fit neatly into the organization
                            geometry of the system which has been so successful, heretofore, in
                            meeting our country's troubles.</p>
                        <p>7. The conception that the shooting begins when all else ends was fine
                            for Metternich and safe for Disraeli, but it has no identification
                            whatever with today, when the traditional lines of authority, the
                            traditional compartments of responsibility, and the traditional
                            mechanisms of coordination have been discarded by the aggressor, and he
                            having discarded them, our countervailing arrangements must be
                            correspondingly altered.</p>
                        <p>8. Here is where we run into trouble. The State Department says,
                            “Stabilization of our allies, inducing them to our persuasion, is pure
                            diplomatic business—our business. It has been so for years.”</p>
                        <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0298"/>
                        <p>The military community says, “Insurgents? Guerrillas? Terrorism? That is
                            certainly no mystery to us. We have thousands of skilled fighters to
                            handle it. Just let us at them.”</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> people say, “Stability? Yes, it is primarily a product
                            of elevated standards; and dollars, well dispensed, are the real
                            elevator. Whatever else is involved, the provision of financial help is
                            still first, and that, of course, is our affair.”</p>
                        <p>And the information people; they feel much the same. “Enlightenment is
                            the answer, the real enduring answer, and we have that in hand.”</p>
                        <p>9. And on it goes. The fact is, they are all wrong; and they are all
                            right, too. If we are to succeed in beating the Reds at their own game,
                            our problem-solving mechanism somehow has to synthesize the strengths of
                            all of these fine activities, somehow has to blot out the organizational
                            lines and function as a single matrix of power. The time is past when we
                            can hope to meet the Communists with a system in which diplomacy, guns,
                            propaganda, and dollars all seek to function alone, each immured in its
                            own well-defined proprietary area. The Communists are organized for
                            aggression on a homogeneous basis. Regrettably as they are on the
                            offensive, they call much of the tune, and we simply have to organize to
                            meet them.</p>
                        <p>10. That brings me to the Special Group (<gloss target="#t_CI1">CI</gloss>). This, to me, forms the beginning of our answer, since
                            it draws together, at a decisive level, the same resources that the
                            Communists employ habitually against us as a unified entity. In other
                            words, this Special Group idea gives us the mechanism to face
                            consolidated aggressive power with consolidated quick-reacting power. I
                            believe the Special Group scheme is the counterinsurgency answer—at the
                            Washington level:</p>
                        <p>a. <hi rend="italic">If</hi> all of the participants can identify
                            themselves with the executive function and avoid identification as
                            institutional representatives</p>
                        <p>b. <hi rend="italic">If</hi> they are confronted with only problems of
                            major magnitude (there are certainly enough of these); and </p>
                        <p>c. <hi rend="italic">If</hi> they are supported adequately and
                            dynamically by a working group which seeks to unite, at a lower level,
                            these same functions which go to make up our counterinsurgency
                            strength.</p>
                        <p>This latter arrangement, we do not now have, or we have on only the most
                            informal and uncertain basis.</p>
                        <p>11. Therefore, it would be my idea that each member of the Special Group
                                (<gloss target="#t_CI1">CI</gloss>) should designate a working
                            deputy; these deputies to meet regularly on matters placed on the <gloss target="#t_CI1">CI</gloss> Group agenda by the Group; that the
                            working deputies should dispose, by accord, of the counterinsurgency
                            matters of lesser concern and present to the Group, staffed and in
                            condition for decision (hard though it sometimes may be), the matters of
                            prime concern.</p>
                        <pb n="279" xml:id="pg_279" facs="0299"/>
                        <p>12. It may be said that this contemplates more work; probably it does,
                            but it will be worth it in the speed-up of counterinsurgency decisions.
                            It may also be said that this whole <gloss target="#t_CI1">CI</gloss>
                            Group idea is wrong, inasmuch as it transgresses organizational lines;
                            but, as I implied before, this is the view that conveys real comfort to
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>.</p>

                            situation here, during which <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>
                            was relaxed and in rather optimistic mood, I raised subject of two
                            correspondents of US publications threatened by expulsion. I said I had
                            been happy to learn through <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>
                            that expulsion order for Bigart had been countermanded by President, and
                            that I hoped very much that, upon reflection, President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> had decided also to countermand
                            the expulsion order against <persName corresp="#p_SF3">Sully</persName>.
                            I made it clear that I was not defending <persName corresp="#p_SF3">Sully</persName> as a person, and that I did not always agree with
                            the line taken by <hi rend="italic">Newsweek</hi> regarding Viet-Nam;
                            but that I felt very strongly, and had been explicitly so instructed by
                            US Government, that the expulsion of the correspondent of an influential
                            US publication would have a most damaging effect on public and
                            Congressional opinion at home, and would greatly complicate our
                            relations. Pointing out that it seemed to me that public approval in the
                            US for our policy of support to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            was steadily increasing, I asked President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> not to jeopardize this by action to expel <hi rend="italic">Newsweek</hi>'s correspondent. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> supported this, pointing
                            out that he too felt encouraged by the increased recognition by US
                            correspondents here of the success of efforts being made by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> with our assistance.</p>
                        <pb n="280" xml:id="pg_280" facs="0300"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> said that this whole matter
                            was painful to him. He wished to make it clear, for his part, that
                                <persName corresp="#p_SF3">Sully</persName> had for many years been
                            both derogatory and insulting in what he had written and said about the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and specifically about the
                            President, members of his government, and members of his family.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> said that he realized
                            his government was not perfect, that one could truthfully point out weak
                            spots, errors, and failures but there were good things to be said also,
                            and these should not be neglected. But most especially, he said, he
                            objected to those journalists who went out of their way to malign the
                            personal integrity of the chief of state, his ministers, or his family.
                            He said this was particularly true of <persName corresp="#p_SF3">Sully</persName>. He asked whether President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> would permit a foreign
                            correspondent who publicly questioned his personal integrity to remain
                            in the US and enjoy its facilities. He again mentioned his conviction
                            that stories emanating from certain US correspondents here published in
                            the US press contributed to the political unrest in Viet-Nam, and
                            specifically to the recent near assassination of himself and his
                            family.</p>
                        <p>I again said that I hoped he did not misinterpret my démarche (and I am
                            sure he did not); that I was not defending a person or a publication,
                            but was insisting, for the sake of our common cause, that he not make a
                            “cause celebre” which would create real political difficulties between
                            us. After considerable discussion, it came out that he had decided to
                            allow both Bigart and <persName corresp="#p_SF3">Sully</persName> to
                            remain until the expiration of their visas, and then not to renew their
                            visas. He said that he understood Bigart's visa expires toward the end
                            of April and <persName corresp="#p_SF3">Sully</persName>'s in June or
                            July. I said that I had understood from <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> that there was no further sanction hanging over
                            Bigart, that I was disappointed now to hear that Bigart's visa would not
                            be renewed if requested. This would cause grave difficulties. The
                            President replied that this was a normal prerogative of government and
                            was a simple and unspectacular way to handle both men. I said that I did
                            not question his prerogative, but that from point of view of our common
                            endeavor such a course would be most unwise.</p>
                        <p>We left it for the present that no positive action would be taken against
                            either Bigart or Sully. (<persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>
                            said that the lifting of the ban against <persName corresp="#p_SF3">Sully</persName> was “tres penible” to him.) As to the future, I
                            said that I would want to talk with him again on the question when the
                            renewal of the visas came up, and I hoped very much that in the meantime
                            he could think the matter over in the light of our conversation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> gave no indication of
                            willingness to change his mind further, but I am hopeful this may be a
                            face-saving device. I drew rather heavily on credits at the bank on this
                            one, but detected no personal animosity.</p>
                        <pb n="281" xml:id="pg_281" facs="0301"/>
                        <p>The press corps here is naturally very much interested in this affair. I
                            am telling Newsweek, through Robert Elegant, the following: (1) that the
                            expulsion order against <persName corresp="#p_SF3">Sully</persName> will
                            be rescinded; (2) that if and when the question of renewal of his visa
                            comes up, I do not know what the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            decision will be; (3) that I expect both <hi rend="italic">Newsweek</hi>
                            and the US press generally to refrain from publicizing this matter as
                            official US pressure on the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> on
                            behalf of US correspondents. I believe it is best not to reopen the
                            question with Bigart, who apparently now understands there is no
                            hindrance to his remaining here. If and when the renewal of his visa is
                            requested, and if difficulties then arise, we can take the matter up
                            again.</p>
                        <p> Elegant said to me yesterday that he feels that <persName corresp="#p_SF3">Sully</persName> has “been here too long”, and is
                            therefore too emotionally involved for balanced judgment. This lead
                            might be worth following up in Washington.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName> reported on the
                            Saigon request at Honolulu<note n="2" xml:id="d134fn2">See <ref target="#d124">Document 124</ref>.</note> that Washington
                            delegate authority to the Embassy and General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> to approve local Vietnamese
                            defoliant operations. Such operations would be on specific targets
                            restricted to Viet Cong crops, laid by Vietnamese helicopters, using
                            chemicals made available by the US. Since these chemicals are
                            commercially available and the Vietnamese have been carrying out crop
                            destruction by burning on the ground, one course of action is for the US
                            to remain aloof and let the Vietnamese carry out operations as they
                            desire. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>,
                            however, sees some advantage in our issuing chemicals on the spot and
                            thereby retaining a “foot in the door” so we know what operations the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> are planning <pb n="282" xml:id="pg_282" facs="0302"/>and executing. <persName corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName> asked for opinions within the
                            Task Force. Military … were in favor; State and <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> were doubtful or in opposition. <persName corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName> will discuss this with
                                <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alexis Johnson</persName>, coordinate
                            with Defense, and probably come forward to the White House with a
                            proposal for delegating authority under carefully defined
                            parameters.</p>
                        <p>The concept for the border patrol as outlined by General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> in Honolulu was discussed
                            and questioned as to its relevance to your recommendation since it
                            involves 88 posts over a frontier area of approximately 250 miles.
                            Admiral Heinz was requested to send a message to Com <gloss target="#t_USMACV1">USMACV</gloss> to get a fuller expression of the
                            approved concept.</p>
                        <p>There was a short discussion on the need for broader-based, more
                            effective planning in South Viet-Nam for civic action. This proposition
                            is understood and supported by Defense and <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>; Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName>
                            resisted early action. <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> and Defense
                            representatives, however, are preparing a draft message for <persName corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName> outlining the overall
                            strategic requirement for civic action and requesting information from
                            Saigon as to existing plans and specific recommendations for US
                            support.</p>
                        <p>Defense also has been able to crash through with a draft telegram
                            prodding Saigon to outline a plan to use both military and civilian
                            assets for the deployment of medical teams in the rural areas. The
                            military side, which is already in pilot stage, will be expanded around
                            the ARPA project. <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> bought the ARPA
                            idea 100 percent and acted as if they had never seen it before. This is
                            the same project we tried to push through Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName> almost two months ago and
                            which you brought up at the Special Group meeting two weeks ago.</p>
                        <p>As a related matter, you should know that the new <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> representative at the Task Force, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWG1">Stoneman</persName>, who is also the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> Viet-Nam Desk Officer, is aggressive
                            and far-seeing and already getting results. You may wish to comment on
                            this to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HF5">Hamilton</persName>.</p>

                        <p>During the March 1st meeting of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> with the

                                been found.</note> the President stated a requirement for a

                            fail. I believe that about April 1st you should ask Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> how this project is
                            coming.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> indicated that
                            we need a plan for the induction of U.S. forces <hi rend="italic">before</hi> the loss of the total interior of South Vietnam, if
                            such a catastrophe were about to overtake us. An important item in this
                            planning, according to the President, is the timing of a decision for
                            U.S. action and the factors that go into such a decision.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows a paragraph on another matter.]</p>
                        <p>The President has placed a requirement on us to bring him a report of the
                            political and economic operations in South Vietnam. Two items especially
                            concern him: ten provincial surveys were approved but only two or three
                            teams so far are in action; second is the civic action teams that follow
                            the military activities. It was reported that civic action teams were
                            not going out into the country, that the South Vietnamese had no stomach
                            for this operation, and that we would have to do something about it.</p>
                        <p>Is the JCS going to send the Caribou aircraft out to South Vietnam in
                            June or are they going to send helicopters?</p>

                        <p> RE </p>
                        <p>Viet Cong Activity</p>
                        <p>Viet Cong activity is being intensified on an increasingly broader
                            spectrum. Attacks against reserve forces have been enlarged to supply
                            lines, communications, transportation, and even to units of South Viet
                            Nam's regular forces.</p>
                        <p>On March 27 Viet Cong attacked and derailed four trains and tore up the
                            tracks. On the same day the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> for the
                            first time attacked two vehicles of the International Control Commission
                            and wounded two individuals. The vehicles were plainly painted and
                            marked with insignia of the Commission.</p>
                        <p>In the face of this increased activity, South Viet Nam statistics, in one
                            area in particular, are somewhat alarming. Desertions from the regular
                            forces have increased to 1,000 a month. Even this does not include the
                            figures among the pare-military forces. When the battle casualties are
                            added the total losses are expected to increase to the point where an
                            overall increase in the effectiveness of the South Viet Nam armed forces
                            is doubtful. The significance of the high desertion rate is indicative
                            of military and national leadership. More fundamentally, it reflects the
                            willingness of the South Vietnamese to free himself from the Communist
                            menace.</p>
                        <p>The Chief of the British Advisory Commission, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName>, feels that the philosophy of
                            the present effort in South Viet Nam is wrong. Based on his experience
                            in Malaya, he feels that the conflict is between the Communists and
                            South Viet Nam citizens instead of between <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s government and the Viet Cong guerrilla forces.
                            The village is the foundation of the social structure of Viet Nam. The
                            villages also constitute the base of Viet Cong organization and support.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> concludes that
                            present government action will never be too successful unless this fact
                            is dealt with and the role of the civil defense forces increased.
                            Therefore, he recommends that the villagers <pb n="285" xml:id="pg_285" facs="0305"/>be encouraged or even rewarded to resist the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. He would also concentrate training of
                            the villagers even at the expense of units of the regular forces to
                            disrupt the base of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> efforts.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President: I believe the facts of Communist aggression against the
                            Vietnamese people are now well known to you. Despite Communist lies, the
                            evidence on record cannot be hidden.</p>
                        <p>However, I would like to draw your particular attention to the January 18
                            Hanoi announcement of the founding of the so-called people's
                            revolutionary party. This announcement is virtual admission of Hanoi's
                            direction and control of the Viet Cong rebels who are brutally attacking
                            our people.</p>
                        <p>On January 18, the Hanoi radio broadcast the declaration of the new
                            Communist creation, the so-called Vietnamese people's revolutionary
                            party. This declaration states that in the last days of 1961
                            “Marxist-Leninists” in South Vietnam established a new party, with its
                            “immediate tasks” being to unite the people and “to overthrow” the
                            Government of Viet-Nam. It also declared that the party “calls on the
                            people in the North to build an ever more prosperous and strong North
                            Vietnam, making it a solid basis for the struggle for peaceful
                            reunification of the country, to give active support to their
                            compatriots in South Vietnam in their revolutionary struggle.” Here at
                            last is a public admission of what has always been clear-that the Viet

                        <p>The North Vietnamese admission that the Viet Cong attacks on the free
                            people of Viet-Nam—attacks which now average more than 400 per week and
                            claim total casualties of nearly 800 per week—are henceforth to be
                            openly Communist directed must be a matter of concern for all
                            nations.</p>
                        <p>The Communists have now themselves made it clear that they are making
                            another brutal attempt in their effort to achieve world domination.</p>
                        <pb n="286" xml:id="pg_286" facs="0306"/>
                        <p>This attempt is not new. For more than seven years the Communists have
                            most cynically violated the Geneva Accords of 1954. The central purpose
                            of these Accords, which established a cease-fire, is to maintain the
                            peace in Viet-Nam. The Communist regime in Hanoi is violating this basic
                            purpose by its direction and support of the expanding guerrilla war
                            which it is carrying on in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The Hanoi regime made clear its objective when the Communist (Lao Dong)
                            Party in North Vietnam stated at its 1960 congress that a strategic task
                            of “the Vietnamese revolution” is “to liberate South Vietnam”—the
                            Communist jargon for conquering a country already free. Evidence based
                            on captured documents and prisoners shows that, in order to carry out
                            this task, the Hanoi regime is infiltrating armed personnel by the
                            thousands into South Vietnam to mount over increasing guerrilla war
                            activities.</p>
                        <p>In view of this guerrilla campaign, the Government of the Republic of
                            Viet-Nam has been compelled to appeal for increased military assistance
                            and support from free world countries to help prevent it from being
                            overwhelmed by massive subversion from Communist North Vietnam, backed
                            by heavily increased support from the Communist bloc. Even the regime in
                            Hanoi has recognized that the free world's increased assistance is
                            needed and being used in South Vietnam for defensive purposes. In an
                            interview broadcast over Hanoi Radio January 1, 1962, Major General
                            Nguyen Van Vinh, chairman of the so-called “National Reunification
                            Commission”, stated that the Government of the Republic of Viet-Nam
                            supported by the United States is not now preparing for a “march to the
                            North.”</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, the Communist bloc has conducted an extensive airlift
                            of military supplies into North Vietnam for aggressive purposes for well
                            over a year. Part of this military material has been sent on to Laos to
                            support the rebels and Viet Cong fighting the legitimate Government
                            there, but much of it has been turned over to the Communist regime in
                            North Vietnam to build up its war potential against South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>A grave threat to peace thus exists and can be removed only if the
                            Communist regime in Hanoi is forced to desist in its guerrilla war
                            against the legal Government of the Republic of Viet-Nam, of which I
                            have the honor to be President. World opinion is likely to serve as an
                            important factor in the future decisions of the Communist authorities
                            about this guerrilla war. I am, therefore, writing to you, Excellency,
                            to bring the facts about the serious situation in Viet-Nam to your
                            attention and to request that you raise your voice in defense of freedom
                            and <pb n="287" xml:id="pg_287" facs="0307"/>peace in this area of the

                                Vietnam</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Herewith, the summary I promised you of recent progress in implementing
                            the strategic concept for South Vietnam in recent months. A systematic
                            counterinsurgency operation has been launched very recently in an effort
                            to eliminate Viet Cong guerrilla-subversive forces and rehabilitate the
                            countryside on an area-by-area basis. The most notable progress,
                            however, has been in the civilian rather than in the military sector.
                            The strategic village concept, for example, has taken hold within both
                            the Vietnam Government (<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>) and the US
                            Mission; this concept is now a matter of national, high-priority policy
                            for the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. Also, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s Civic Action program has been
                            reoriented and is being revitalized and expanded. Indeed, strategic
                            village and Civic Action concepts now are integrated and vital in the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s general effort against the
                            Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>Specific examples of this progress are noted below.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. A Systematic Counterinsurgency Plan</p>
                        <p>1. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> approved the

                            operation to clear the Viet Cong from the Mekong River delta and
                            re-establish government control on an area-by-area basis by giving
                            protection to the villagers and cutting off Viet Cong access to the
                            villages. (See Embassy Telegram 1191, March 20, 1962, Secret.)<note n="3" xml:id="d139fn3">

                        </p>
                        <p>2. The first part of such a plan has been initiated in the form of
                            “Operation Sunrise.” The operation is confined to Binh Duong province
                            but once its objectives have been achieved, a similar plan (as modified
                            on the basis of experience) will be applied in other delta provinces and
                            ultimately throughout most of the country. (See <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss>

                            Embassy Telegram Toaid 647, March 13, 1962, Secret.)<note n="4" xml:id="d139fn4">Unless otherwise indicated in footnotes, the
                                remaining documents cited in this memorandum are not printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. “Operation Sunrise” consists of three phases. The first phase,
                            initiated a month or two ago, involves essentially the necessary
                            planning. The second phase involves military operations, the relocation
                            of hamlets into compact and fortified strategic villages, and Civic
                            Action activities within these villages (since this phase began on March
                            22, 1962, it is too early to make an assessment of it). The third phase
                            is the period of consolidation emphasizing stepped-up Civic Action
                            activities. The objectives during this phase are to strengthen security,
                            build a socio-political base at the village level, and tie the villages
                            into the national governmental system and the national fabric. The
                            success of “Operation Sunrise” is overridingly keyed to strategic
                            village and Civic Action concepts, thus reflecting the essentially
                            political nature of the problem in South Vietnam. (See <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> 3010, February 24, 1962,
                            Secret.)</p>
                        <p>4. The US Mission in Vietnam, when asked by the Vietnam Task Force
                            whether all Saigon agencies concurred in the validity of the <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> approach to
                            counterinsurgency, replied that the Delta Plan “accords in essence” with
                            counterinsurgency planning as worked out and approved by the Mission.
                            (See Embassy Telegram 1159, March 9, 1962, Secret.)<note n="5" xml:id="d139fn5">See <ref target="#d101fn2">footnote 2, Document

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Strategic Hamlets or Villages</p>
                        <p>1. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> signed
                            a decree on February 3, 1962, creating a special “Interministerial
                            Committee for Strategic Hamlets” which will coordinate the strategic
                            hamlet or village program on a country-wide basis. (See Embassy Despatch
                            355, February 27, 1962, Unclassified.)<note n="6" xml:id="d139fn6">See
                                    <ref target="#d46">Document 46</ref>.</note>

                        <pb n="293" xml:id="pg_293" facs="0313"/>
                        <p>2. Although precise information is not available, it is estimated that
                            150-200 strategic hamlets or villages have been established throughout
                            more than half of Vietnam's 39 provinces. In one province, Vinh Long,
                            the province chief claimed the completion of 60 strategic hamlets by
                            January 1962. (See Embassy Despatch 334, February 12, 1962, Official Use
                            Only.)</p>
                        <p>3. The village of Tam An and the hamlet of Tan Phu in Bien Hoa province
                            are examples of the effectiveness of the strategic hamlet or village
                            approach for re-establishing government control in the countryside and
                            promoting self-reliance among the peasantry. (See Embassy Despatch 375,
                            March 16, 1962, Confidential.)</p>
                        <p>a. The Tam An administration, virtually eliminated by the Viet Cong, was
                            re-constituted in October 1961, following an army sweep of the area. A
                            well-built defense post was constructed on a strategic site, equipped by
                            a radio and defended by small locally recruited Self Defense Corps and
                            Civil Guard units. A new village council was created, gifts of medicine,
                            clothing, and rice were given by the province chief, and no reprisals
                            were taken against villagers who once were suspected of cooperating with
                            the Viet Cong. This village has since remained free of the Viet
                            Cong.</p>
                        <p>b. Tan Phu had been for years prior to July 1961 under almost complete
                            Viet Cong control. Following a security sweep of the area in November
                            1961, the province chief began to transform Tan Phu into a typical
                            strategic hamlet (surrounding ditch, barbed-wire embankment, defense
                            post, watch tower, etc.) and defended by a small locally recruited Self
                            Defense Corps unit. The administrative system was strengthened and
                            improved by the addition of vigorous and interested officials. Tan Phu
                            continues to remain free of the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. Civic Action</p>
                        <p>1. On January 19, 1962, the Vietnamese Department of Civic Action was
                            reorganized, creating (i) a central Civic Action Service in Saigon by
                            combining related and heretofore separate services within the Department
                            and (ii) an integrated Civic Action office in each province and
                            district. (See Embassy Despatch 380, March 15, 1962, Confidential.)</p>
                        <p>2. As of January 24, 1962, a chief and deputy chief for Civic Action
                            reportedly had been appointed in every province in South Vietnam. (See
                            CS-3, 502,549, Saigon, February 27, 1962, Confidential, <gloss target="#t_noforn1">Noforn</gloss>, Continued Control.)</p>
                        <p>3. Civilian Civic Action teams have been operating generally in the
                            Mekong River delta and primarily in Tay Ninh, Binh Duong, and Phuoc Tuy
                            provinces. (See Embassy Telegram Toaid 647, March 13, 1962; Embassy

                        <p>a. The teams consist of up to 20 specialists in health, agriculture
                            police, education, information, public administration, public works and
                            communications</p>
                        <p>b. Recently, the mission of these teams has been increasingly focused on
                            the strategic hamlet or village program.</p>
                        <p>c. Civilian Civic Action activities are coordinated by the Department of
                            Civic Action, assisted in men and material by the other departments and
                            operationally directed at the local level by the district and provincial
                            administrative authorities.</p>
                        <p>d. In instances where they are employed in a systematic counterinsurgency
                            operation, as in “Operation Sunrise,” Civic Action teams are temporarily
                            under direct military control but will subsequently revert to district
                            and provincial civilian control.</p>

                            provide on a priority basis direct US assistance (and to coordinate such

                            Government agencies.</p>
                        <p>4. The Vietnamese Defense Department is now planning its own Civic Action

                            security services is reflected in the US Mission's recommendation that
                            the strength of the Self Defense Corps be increased to 80,000 by fiscal
                            year 1963 and that of the Civil Guard to 90,000 by fiscal year 1964.

                            for fiscal year 1962. (See Department Telegram 1010, February 21, 1962,

                            province during April 6-25, and most of the remainder are to be
                            installed concurrently in Binh Duong province where “Operation Sunrise”
                            is now in progress. Priorities have also been established for four other

                            1962, when a joint <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>-Vietnamese
                            radio installation team was attacked by Viet Cong guerrillas. The
                            security escort engaged the Viet Cong while the team proceeded to
                            install the village <pb n="295" xml:id="pg_295" facs="0315"/>radio and
                            then notified district headquarters and other village radio stations.
                            Assistance was despatched and resulted in an ambush of the Viet Cong as
                            they were fleeing toward another village which had been alerted. (See

                            program. The categorization of these projects was based on their
                            immediate impact on the “counterinsurgency and short-range security
                            objectives in accordance with current US policy.” (See Department

                        <p>A military operation in late February or early March of this year
                            reflects the effective utilization of security forces and artillery in
                            counter-guerrilla warfare. A combined Vietnamese Army ranger, Civil
                            Guard, and Self Defense Corps force, supported by an Army artillery
                            unit, engaged a Viet Cong guerrilla company in a pre-planned operation
                            in Kien Hoa province. The Viet Cong initially stood and fought but then
                            broke and attempted to withdraw. At that point, artillery fire was
                            requested on the retreating Viet Cong and inflicted severe casualties.
                            In large measure, this operation succeeded, first, because artillery was
                            not employed at the outset (which would have alerted the Viet Cong and
                            permitted them to escape) and, second, because the use of Civil Guard
                            and Self Defense Corps forces (which are essentially defensive forces)
                            in an offensive mission was supported by a participating regular army

                        <p>Congressman Saund of California, a member of the House Foreign Affairs
                            Committee, made an informal suggestion recently that in Viet-Nam more
                            use should be made of nationals of countries nearby and thus reduce the
                            number of U.S. servicemen required. Having been born in the area, the
                            Congressman was especially convincing in presenting this point of
                            view.</p>
                        <p>Since then we have given considerable attention to the question and I
                            brought it up for discussion in a meeting with the officers of the Joint
                            Staff of the JCS. I believe that it meats current consideration.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. servicemen or their replacements may be in Viet-Nam for many
                            years; the 5,200 there now evidently will be increased to 8,000 or
                            10,000 with arrivals reported frequently in the press.</p>
                        <p>The nationals most likely to be available and acceptable in Viet-Nam are
                            those of the Philippines but others of the area might be usable.
                            Filipino civilian technicians of the Eastern Construction Company are
                            said to be working effectively in Laos.</p>
                        <p>Psychologically, it would be of obvious benefit to us in the Far East and
                            in our international relations generally, if other nations of the area
                            were cooperating with us militarily in Viet-Nam as a visible
                            demonstration of solidarity against Communist attack. There would also
                            be psychological advantages in the United States.</p>
                        <p>You are aware of the President's desire for us to induce other nations to
                            work with us to the extent feasible in Viet-Nam, as evidenced in point 6

                        </list>
                        <p>The following considerations influence our thinking on Viet-Nam:</p>
                        <p>1. We have a growing military commitment. This could expand step by step
                            into a major, long-drawn out indecisive military involvement.</p>
                        <p>2. We are backing a weak and, on the record, ineffectual government and a
                            leader who as a politician may be beyond the point of no return.</p>
                        <p>3. There is consequent danger we shall replace the French as the colonial
                            force in the area and bleed as the French did.</p>
                        <p>4. The political effects of some of the measures which pacification
                            requires or s believed to require, including the concentration of
                            population, relocation of villages, and the burning of old villages, may
                            be damaging to those and especially to Westerners associated with
                            it.</p>
                        <p>5. We fear that at some point in the involvement there will be a major
                            political outburst about the new Korea and the new war into which the
                            Democrats as so often before have precipitated us.</p>
                        <p>6. It seems at least possible that the Soviets are not particularly
                            desirous of trouble in this part of the world and that our military
                            reaction with the need to fall back on Chinese protection may be causing
                            concern in Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>In the light of the foregoing we urge the following:</p>
                        <p>1. That it be our policy to keep open the door for political solution. We
                            should welcome as a solution any broadly based non-Communist government
                            that is free from external interference. It should have the requisites
                            for internal law and order. We should not require that it be militarily
                            identified with the United States.</p>
                        <p>2. We shall find it useful in achieving this result if we seize any good
                            opportunity to involve other countries and world opinion in settlement
                            and its guarantee. This is a useful exposure and pressure on the
                            Communist bloc countries and a useful antidote for the argument that
                            this is a private American military adventure.</p>
                        <p>3. We should measurably reduce our commitment to the particular present
                            leadership of the Government of South Viet-Nam.</p>

                        <p>To accomplish the foregoing, we recommend the following specific
                            steps:</p>
                        <p>1. In the next fortnight or so the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>
                            will Present a report which we are confidentially advised will accuse
                            North Viet-Nam of subversion and the Government of Viet-Nam in
                            conjunction with the United States of not notifying the introduction of
                            men and materiel as prescribed by the Geneva accords. We should respond
                            by asking the cochairman to initiate steps to re-establish compliance
                            with the Geneva accords. Pending specific recommendations, which might
                            at some stage include a conference of signatories, we should demand a
                            suspension of Viet Cong activity and agree to a standstill on an
                            introduction of men and matériel.</p>
                        <p>2. Additionally, Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>
                            should be instructed to approach the Russians to express our concern
                            about the increasingly dangerous situation that the Viet Cong is forcing
                            in Southeast Asia. They should be told of our determination not to let
                            the Viet Cong overthrow the present government while at the same time to
                            look without relish on the dangers that this military build-up is
                            causing in the area. The Soviets should be asked to ascertain whether
                            Hanoi can and will call off the Viet Cong activity in return for phased
                            American withdrawal, liberalization in the trade relations between the
                            two parts of the country and general and non-specific agreement to talk
                            about reunification after some period of tranquillity.</p>
                        <p>3. Alternatively, the Indians should be asked to make such an approach to
                            Hanoi under the same terms of reference.</p>
                        <p>4. It must be recognized that our long-run position cannot involve an
                            unconditional commitment to <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>.
                            Our support is to non-Communist and progressively democratic government
                            not to individuals. We cannot ourselves replace <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>. But w. e should be clear in, our
                            mind that almost any non-Communist change would probably be beneficial
                            and this should be the guiding rule for our diplomatic representation in
                            the area.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime policy should continue to be guided by the following:</p>
                        <p>1. We should resist all steps which commit American troops to combat
                            action and impress upon all concerned the importance of keeping American
                            forces out of actual combat commitment.</p>
                        <p>2. We should disassociate ourselves from action, however necessary, which
                            seems to be directed at the villagers, such as the new concentration
                            program. If the action is one that is peculiarly identified with
                            Americans, such as defoliation, it should not be undertaken in the
                            absence of most compelling reasons. Americans in their various roles
                            should be as invisible as the situation permits.</p>

                                the controversy sure to be generated by the conclusions, and that he
                                would like to discuss the proposals with the President after he had

                        <p>3. A third U.S. objective in non-Communist Asia should be <hi rend="italic">the maintenance of an effective but unprovocative
                                military presence</hi> capable of deterring an overt attack by
                            Communist forces.<note n="2" xml:id="d142fn2">The first two objectives
                                were: (1) “to help create independent states, free to make their own
                                choices, capable of maintaining their own internal security, and
                                ready to cooperate with us in case of overt aggression;” and (2)
                                “the fostering of increased cooperation among the nations of the
                                region.”</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>At present the Seventh Fleet and other U.S. forces provide such a
                            deterrent. Even among the unaligned nations the importance of this
                            military shield is increasingly recognized in private discussions, even
                            though not always in public statements.</p>
                        <p>However, the failure of the Lao and South Vietnamese governments, with
                            almost unlimited U.S. support, to create viable societies which their
                            people are prepared vigorously to defend has led to a direct U.S.
                            confrontation with Communist forces in Southeast Asia. This in turn has
                            raised far-reaching questions about the political framework in which our
                            military forces can be most effectively employed.</p>
                        <p>As I have noted in an earlier section, many vigorously anti-Communist
                            Asians believe that Western-sponsored regional defense organizations,
                            such as <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>, do more damage than
                            good to the cause of regional unity and security. Similar doubts as to
                                <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>'s usefulness were expressed
                            by several of our Mission Chiefs at the recent Regional Operations
                            Conference at Baguio.</p>
                        <pb n="300" xml:id="pg_300" facs="0320"/>
                        <p>Although our abrupt abandonment of this organization now might be
                            interpreted as an act of weakness, I believe that on balance it has
                            hindered rather than helped our efforts during the last few years.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, it could be persuasively argued that a conspicuous American
                            military presence in an area bordering directly on Communist China may,
                            in certain circumstances, serve more as a magnet for Communist pressures
                            than as an effective defense.</p>
                        <p>When we contrast the ability of such unaligned nations as Cambodia and
                            Burma to destroy indigenous Communist guerrillas and to contain
                            Communist infiltration across their borders with the vulnerability of
                            Vietnam and Laos, which are closely associated with us, it is difficult
                            to escape such a conclusion.</p>
                        <p>This is not to deny the importance of the U.S. military role in those
                            unaligned nations that are not under direct Communist pressure.</p>
                        <p>For instance, the Pentagon's training of Indonesian officers has created
                            powerful pro-U.S. attitudes within the Indonesian armed forces which may
                            be the key to Indonesia's political future.</p>
                        <p>Similarly, American military missions can help train and arm indigenous
                            forces, on the model of the new Cambodian army, that combine an
                            effective counter-guerrilla capacity with skill in building bridges,
                            roads, schools, and clinics. This provides a counter-subversion force
                            that can also act as a powerful bridge between the people and their
                            government.</p>
                        <p>4. A final objective for U.S. policy <hi rend="italic">is the
                                stabilization of the three outstanding politico-military situations
                                which now endanger the region</hi> and in which our own military
                            forces have become indirectly or directly involved.</p>
                        <p>These are the impasse in Laos, the war in South Vietnam, and the
                            precarious balance in the Taiwan Straits.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows a brief section on the impasse in Laos.]</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Here again the new Administration has taken courageous steps to save a
                            situation that had been rapidly deteriorating.</p>
                        <p>Yet the outcome remains unclear; the situation in Vietnam may develop in
                            any one of three ways.</p>
                        <p>1) One possibility would be a clear-cut military victory by the South
                            Vietnamese government, the destruction of the Vietminh guerrillas and a
                            restabilization of the divided country along the lines of the 1954
                            Geneva Agreement.</p>
                        <p>Much as we desire this outcome, it appears to me unlikely, given the
                            present Vietnamese leadership. It is difficult to see how our weapons
                            and training can compensate for the politically weak base on which
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> operates; his
                            liabilities will tend to limit the effectiveness of the most carefully
                            planned military tactics.</p>
                        <pb n="301" xml:id="pg_301" facs="0321"/>
                        <p>2) A second eventuality would be the drastic worsening of the existing
                            situation and the threat of total collapse of South Vietnamese armed
                            resistance. What should we do then?</p>
                        <p>It may be argued persuasively that the Rubicon has already been crossed,
                            that U.S. prestige is now irretrievably committed, that our failure to
                            throw in whatever force may be required-regardless of the Chinese
                            military reaction-will result in the collapse of all the independent
                            nations of Southeast Asia and the total humiliation of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>In rebuttal, it may be said that a French army of 350,000 failed to
                            defeat or contain Vietminh forces that were less well organized than
                            those now operating within gunshot of Saigon; that this failure cost the
                            French 90,000 casualties <hi rend="italic">without</hi> active Chinese
                            Communist participation; that under present circumstances the Chinese
                            would quite probably react to a major American military effort near
                            their borders by entering the war as they did in Korea; that if the
                            Vietnam government should collapse under pressure, our embarrassment,
                            although acute, would not be fatal; and that the independent nations of
                            Southeast Asia, finally free of any illusions about the immediacy of the
                            Communist danger, could then be rallied for effective defense.</p>
                        <p>If the President should determine that deeper U.S. military involvement
                            is not worth the likely consequences, some skillful balancing will be
                            required.</p>
                        <p>On the one hand, we will need to avoid public statements which may later
                            compound our embarrassment if the situation in fact should turn against
                            us. On the other, we should continue to leave the Vietminh, Communist
                            Chinese, and Soviets with reason to fear a massive U.S. military
                            movement against the heart of the Vietminh operations in Hanoi if such
                            action should prove necessary to save the situation in South
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>3) A third possibility-and one which our skillful operations of the last
                            few months make most likely-is that there will be neither total victory
                            nor total defeat but rather the development of an uneasy fluid stalemate
                            with the Viet Cong unable to crack the U.S.-supported government forces,
                            yet still able to maintain an effective opposition.</p>
                        <p>Although we Americans have never found it easy to accept such a
                            situation, the prospect is not wholly discouraging. With the Viet Cong
                            threat held in check, the South Vietnamese government would have another
                            chance to build a solid foundation of popular support while at the same
                            time we could explore the possibilities for a more permanent negotiated
                            political settlement.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Lines of Action:</p>
                        <p>1. Clearly and publicly define our political objective of a neutral and
                            independent Southeast Asian area as stated above.</p>
                        <p>2. With an absolute minimum of direct U.S. involvement and fanfare,
                            strive to stabilize the military situation in Vietnam; our minimal aim
                            should be a deadlock which will provide a basis for meaningful
                            negotiation (i.e., a situation in which operations have become so costly
                            to the Vietminh that continued fighting becomes unprofitable).</p>
                        <p>3. Without further committing U.S. military forces, keep the Vietminh,
                            Communist Chinese and Soviets apprehensive that we may move vigorously
                            against North Vietnam and even China in response to any increased effort
                            on their part south of the 17th parallel.</p>
                        <p>4. Decide what specific political terms will be acceptable to us and to
                            South Vietnam, as we have already done in Laos, and make known through a
                            third party our willingness to negotiate with the Russians or others on
                            that basis.</p>
                        <p>5. Continue our efforts in Laos to create a neutral and independent
                            government under Souvanna. At the same time, prepare a contingency plan
                            for the De facto partition of Laos, in the event of a breakdown in the
                            present negotiations.</p>
                        <p>6. Keep unaligned nations such as India, Indonesia and Burma informed of
                            our genuine desire for a Vietnam and Laos settlement that will assure a
                            neutral and independent Southeast Asia and the ultimate withdrawal of an
                            overt U.S. military presence.</p>
                        <p>7. On a step-by-step basis, move toward the dissolution of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> and the replacement of its
                            guarantor functions by U.S. bilateral guarantees, on an interim basis,
                            and ultimately, by great-power guarantees of Southeast Asia's security
                            from external aggression.</p>
                        <p>The following steps would be relevant:</p>
                        <p>a) The termination of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>'s
                            non-military aspects and the transfer of its viable non-military program
                            (e.g., the Graduate School of Engineering in Bangkok) to other
                            sponsorship;</p>
                        <p>b) The granting of an interim bilateral guarantee to Thailand similar to
                            our present guarantees to the Philippines and Pakistan, and a public
                            reaffirmation of our commitment to defend the protocol states (Laos,
                            Cambodia, and South Vietnam); at the same time, we should <pb n="303" xml:id="pg_303" facs="0323"/>de-emphasize our military presence in
                            Thailand, while vigorously supporting the Thai government in economic
                            and political development and reform in the north and northeast, backed
                            by civic action and counter-subversion units.</p>
                        <p>c) An intensive, confidential information program within the region in
                            the course of these steps, to explain this process of gradual
                            dissolution and to reassure the relevant states.</p>
                        <p>d) As the situations in Laos and Vietnam move toward stabilization, probe
                            the Soviets and Chinese on their willingness to join in a guarantee for
                            the region as a whole; in respect to the Chinese, this step relates to
                            the possibility of grain shipments for local currencies under the
                            carefully prescribed conditions to which I have already referred.</p>
                        <p>e) Throughout this process, continue to make clear U.S. determination to
                            oppose with whatever force may be required any and all overt aggression
                            in Southeast Asia by either the Chinese Communists or the Vietminh.]</p>

                        <p>This memorandum makes two points of interest:</p>
                        <p>a. Continued reluctance in Saigon to propose that Americans participate
                            with, as opposed to coordination with, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in any governmental task.</p>
                        <p>b. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName>'s misgivings on Operation Sunrise are shared by General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>.</p>
                        <p>While Binh Duong is an exposed area, any area which starts the
                            pacification campaign will suffer from some degree of isolation. My
                            understanding of the concept is that regular troops will remain until
                                <pb n="304" xml:id="pg_304" facs="0324"/>the strategic hamlets are
                            constructed and occupied and <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> troops take over defense
                            responsibilities. At that point we want the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> to attack on the premise the positron can hold until
                            reserves can be moved in by hero. This is the classic Malagan concept,

                        <p>1. Department increasingly concerned over constant implications in press
                            generally of U.S. participation and direction, rather than purely
                            support and training of Vietnamese against Viet Cong. Elements of
                            international press and critics of our present policy continue to
                            emphasize “growing U.S. involvement” the “moral responsibilities” and
                            other similar concepts, implying Vietnamese situation is becoming more
                            of a U.S. rather than a Vietnamese war. Even names of operations, such
                            as Sunrise, Farmgate, suggest U.S. rather than <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> planning. </p>
                        <p>2. Part of this press picture is probably developed by observing support

                            leading to conclusion U.S. is assuming leadership of operations, and
                            noting public statements of partnership or joint relationship implying
                            assumption U.S. responsibility.</p>
                        <p>3. An article in the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> Sunday Review
                            Section April 1 by Homer Bigart reports a large group of American
                            colonels and civilians inspected stockade in Operation Sunrise. Why do
                            large groups of Americans inspect anything? It leads Bigart to report
                            that <pb n="306" xml:id="pg_306" facs="0326"/>“Americans were taking on
                            a drastic program that was certain in the initial stages to be bitterly
                            resented by the peasantry whose allegiance must be won.” His references
                            to a U.S. officer helping to plan Sunrise further involves U.S.
                            responsibility. In the eyes of the world these reports lead to this
                            becoming our war rather than their war. This should be prevented.</p>
                        <p>4. There are two dangers, first, adverse international reaction to
                            assumed U.S. dominance, and secondly, Viet Cong using conspicuous US
                            military role to gain popular support from nationalists and
                            anticolonialists by portraying U.S. as assuming former French role.
                            American teams with battalions must not give local impression that they
                            in command of operations.</p>
                        <p>5. It cannot be overstressed that the conduct and utterances public and
                            private of all U.S. personnel must reflect the basic policy of this
                            government that we are in full support of Viet-Nam but we do not assume
                            responsibility for Viet-Nam's war with the Viet-Cong. This
                            responsibility remains with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>6. You should bring this telegram to the attention of all senior members
                            of Task Force Saigon and request them to take appropriate action to
                            impress this policy clearly upon all members of their respective
                            organizations, and also in other ways get the cooperation of all
                            concerned to devise means of minimizing U.S. presence and reducing
                            public impression U.S. going beyond announced objectives.</p>

                        <p>I have given your memorandum of April 2,<note n="2" xml:id="d146fn2">Actually April 3, <ref target="#d140">Document 140</ref>.</note>
                            concerning Congressman Saund's suggestion on Viet-Nam, to <persName corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName>. It's an old story to me,
                            going back to Korea. There is a lot of real reluctance on the part of
                            the military. If anything is to be done about it, top-side pressure has
                            to be brought. I personally agree with your thought, but I don't know if
                            anybody else involved in the operation would want to <pb n="307" xml:id="pg_307" facs="0327"/>do it. An exploration was made at the
                            request of the President some months ago, and the seed didn't take.
                            There are obviously logistic and command difficulties, but I still
                            believe that as you say we are likely to be in Viet-Nam for a long
                            period of time. Command difficulties could probably be worked out. We
                            also might expect some trouble with the Vietnamese—but I don't know how
                            serious that is. If anything is to be done on this whole subject, it
                            will have to be on orders from on high.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> replied to questions
                            at the Viet-Nam Task Force today for an hour and a half. He fully
                            covered his pacification strategy. Some of his opinions/conclusions are
                            of interest.</p>
                        <p>a. Setting up of strategic hamlets and defended villages should not be
                            rushed, should be phased with availability of required resources,
                            material and human.</p>
                        <p>b. Next dry season will see first test of pacification strategy as <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> must react to maintain contact with the
                            population. Question is will <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> be able
                            to resist <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> attacks successfully.</p>
                        <p>c. He is reluctant to estimate the time required to beat the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, but is thinking in terms of 3-6
                            years.</p>
                        <p>d. He stresses need for border ranger force.</p>
                        <p>e. US should get the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> machinery
                            working properly (administration and supervision), but stay clear of the
                            sharp end (village level). He thinks the village organization is the
                            best element in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>f. <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> river forces do not yet control
                            the Delta waterways.</p>
                        <p>g. The <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> troops are tiring; some units
                            must be rotated out of combat or security tasks.</p>
                        <pb n="308" xml:id="pg_308" facs="0328"/>
                        <p>His talk carried unexpressed implications which I suggest you may wish to
                            explore Friday morning:<note n="3" xml:id="d147fn3">April 6; no record
                                of this meeting has been found.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>a. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> organization and capability for
                            control, planning, and public information, and intelligence remains
                            ineffective.</p>
                        <p>b. The numbers of Americans in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> is
                            growing too large; the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> can develop a
                            case that the US is running the show and have in fact replaced the
                            French with all its implications.</p>
                        <p>I have attached suggested questions which can probe these issues
                            further.</p>

                        <p>2. To what extent will <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>
                            respond to advice as to organization for, and implementation of, the

                        <p>3. Is there a need for closer liaison with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> ministries at the seat of government by selected and
                            limited US (or UK) personnel with special qualifications?</p>
                        <p>4. Why is <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> resisting release
                            of ranger companies for mobile operations along the border areas?</p>
                        <p>5. What deficiencies, prejudices, or capabilities are slowing <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> effectiveness in the public information
                            and intelligence fields?</p>
                        <p>6. Are there too many non-Asian advisors now in Saigon? In the

                                memorandum.<note n="2" xml:id="d148fn2">See <ref target="#d141">Document 141</ref>.</note> Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> indicated that while he agreed with some of the

                            it was important that the overt association of the U.S. with military
                            operations in Viet-Nam be reduced to absolute minimum. He showed the

                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> also said he

                            Viet Minh and the U.S. could be achieved. The Governor said he was not
                            in favor, however, of an attempt to reconvene the Geneva Conference or
                            to seek a neutral solution in Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>The Governor said that while he thought that <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> was a losing horse in the long run, he did not
                            think we should actively work against him, because there was nobody to
                            replace him. Rather our policy should be to support the government and
                            people of Viet-Nam, rather than <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> personally.</p>
                        <p>The President asked that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName>'s memorandum be forwarded to Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> for his comments.
                            (I will do.) The President asked what instructions should be given to

                            Indian approach to Hanoi with a view to exploring the possibility of
                            getting them to withdraw from Viet-Nam in conjunction with us. Governor
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> replied that we
                            should await the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> report before
                            deciding our reaction to an Indian approach to Hanoi. If the report is
                            strong, the approach might be worthwhile. The President agreed but said
                            that instructions should nevertheless be sent to <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName>, and that he would like to
                            see such instructions.<note n="4" xml:id="d148fn4">The instructions
                                referred to here have not been found.</note> (<persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> will do early next week; I
                            will make sure the President clears.) The President <pb n="310" xml:id="pg_310" facs="0330"/>observed generally that he wished us to
                            be prepared to seize upon any favorable moment to reduce our
                            involvement, recognizing that the moment might yet be some time
                            away.</p>
                        <p>The President thought it was very important and specifically requested
                            that we prepare now a U.S. position on the anticipated report from the
                                <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>. (I will pass this along to

                        <p>The President asked why defoliation had not been tested elsewhere than
                            Viet-Nam before being tried. He asked <persName corresp="#p_FLMV1">Forrestal</persName> to investigate.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">R.G.K. Thompson</persName>, formerly
                            Permanent Secretary of Defense in Malaya, now Chief of the British
                            Advisory Mission in Saigon, during his visit in Washington between April
                            2 and 7, made the following points in various conversations held with
                            Department, Defense and TF/VN meetings.</p>
                        <p>1) <hi rend="italic">
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>
                            </hi>. Generally unpopular in Saigon, particularly with the
                            “intellectuals”. Much more respected in rural areas. They seem to
                            appreciate that <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> has always
                            insisted that Viet-Nam is an agrarian country whose pattern of life is
                            centered in the villages. His agroville program, his frequent visits to
                            the villages and public statements have all emphasized this orientation.
                            For instance, the last Presidential election, although opposing
                            candidates were weak, did not reveal a rigged, forced vote for <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>. It was apparently held with a
                            minimum of coercion. Chances of getting anything better than <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> is very “chancy”. If there were an
                            Army split struggle for power, upon an event of accident to <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>, you could have a chaotic
                            situation wherein <pb n="311" xml:id="pg_311" facs="0331"/>the
                            Communists might be able to move in. Therefore, it seems the most
                            prudent policy to go along with the <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> regime, attempting to urge improvements where
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>2) <hi rend="italic">Villages</hi>. This is the key to the Vietnamese
                            situation. You must obtain support of the villages in order to win the
                            war. You cannot win unless you get it. There is tremendous energy in the
                            villages, and if a proper framework is established which will provide
                            them security they will fight in their own behalf to preserve a
                            traditional village system against the Viet Cong. Other considerations
                            are important but peripheral. <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> is a strong village man and has in effect said “the
                            hell with the intellectuals”. It is a fact that the villages are
                            anti-Communist, not necessarily pro-<persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>3) <hi rend="italic">Nationalism and Communism</hi>. It is most important
                            to press the distinction. Many so-called Viet Cong are not fighting for
                            Communism. They are with the Viet Cong because they still believe that
                            the Viet Cong are fighting a nationalistic war against foreign
                            domination. Psychological and informational activities should be
                            directed to destroying the link between Nationalism and Communism which
                            now exists. This means that foreign assistance to Viet-Nam must be
                            played in the lowest possible key. Vietnamese should kill Vietnamese but
                            never foreigners killing Vietnamese. The Viet Cong would love to get the
                            Americans more committed to combat in Viet-Nam because they could then
                            wrap themselves in the cloak of Nationalism and recruit more Vietnamese
                            for the fight against the foreign devils. This is why the British
                            believe we should play down U.S. participation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Conclusion:</hi> We should avoid putting a large
                            number of foreigners “at the sharp end”.</p>
                        <p>Translated into operations this means that the U.S. presence in the field
                            where they are visible to villagers and Viet Cong should be minimized.
                            On the other hand, doctors, <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>
                            people, or Civic Action people who are handing out services or goods
                            cause no problem.</p>
                        <p>4) <hi rend="italic">Strategic Hamlet Problem</hi>. Brother
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> has taken a very active interest and for
                            the first time has assumed an executive role as Administrator of the
                            Strategic Hamlet Program. Much of his thinking is good although the
                            program was kicked-off in exaggerated terms. He set up targets of 12,000
                            strategic hamlets to be completed in 18 months and this started a race
                            between the Province Chiefs to frantically build these installations
                            with attendant imposition on the villagers. Twelve of these new hamlets
                            got hit badly in one Corps area because security infrastructure had not
                            been set up concurrently. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> now has lowered his
                            sights and is proceeding more slowly. <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> has insisted that the hamlet program be
                            carefully integrated into the Delta Plan with the necessary security
                            measures keeping pace with the construction of the hamlets. They now
                            seem to be on the right track. Experience in <pb n="312" xml:id="pg_312" facs="0332"/>Malaya indicates that the Government must be firm in
                            resettling villagers and that a certain amount of resentment can be
                            expected at the outset. Later, however, when the benefits, both security
                            and social, become apparent to villagers they generally get to like the
                            system.</p>
                        <p>5) <hi rend="italic">Communications.</hi> This is not yet working
                            properly. Villages where communications have been installed, the results
                            are excellent. The point behind communications is that Viet Cong bands
                            on the move can keep twenty-four hours ahead of any news about them.
                            However, if their presence is communicated from village to village they
                            can be intercepted and cut up. If the network of communications is set
                            up covering sector after sector in connecting links, it would
                            drastically cut the mobility of the Viet Cong. Every effort should be
                            made to hasten the construction of the communications network. Radio
                            should not be put in every hamlet because this is too confusing. Hamlets
                            can use gongs, flares, drums and other simple devices to alert the
                            nearest village.</p>
                        <p>6) <hi rend="italic">Navy</hi>. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            control of the waterways in the Delta area is one of its major
                            weaknesses. Time after time the Viet Cong attack and get away over the
                            rivers in dugouts. This should never happen. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> must work out methods of controlling and denying the
                            use to the Viet Cong. A program seems to be under way with U.S. help but
                            it must be made effective at the earliest possible moment.</p>
                        <p>7) <hi rend="italic">Civil Guard</hi>. Training seems to be going ahead
                            as fast as it can. Civil Guard river patrols are most necessary and
                            getting the civil guard into place to protect the new villages is
                            essential.</p>
                        <p>8) <hi rend="italic">Self Defense Corps</hi>. Beginning to function. Must
                            be tied into the “dear and hold” operations. Self Defense Corps is the
                            key in the village to lead the defense.</p>
                        <p>9) <hi rend="italic">Sunrise</hi>. Plan by the Province Chief of Binh
                            Duong and the Minister of Interior. <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> is a bit worried about this plan because it
                            involves one of the toughest provinces and the forces needed to keep it
                            clean will be tied down to defense duties. He had urged unsuccessfully
                            that the “clean and hold” operations start in easier areas and push
                            forward against the stronger provinces. It does, however, show a good
                            spirit on the part of the Vietnamese and indicates the right
                            direction.</p>
                        <p>10) <hi rend="italic">Air Power</hi>. <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> was worried several months ago about the damage
                            from any indiscriminate attacks. Says he thinks the situation is much
                            improved through the installation of a JOC and TAC. However, the use of
                            air in the form of the helicopters, 123, and attack planes has been
                            remarkably effective. It has crippled Viet Cong freedom to attack in
                            large formations and has had a telling effect on Viet Cong morale. He
                            thought the overall effect of some villagers being killed accidentally
                            in attacks on villages probably depended upon how other villagers
                            reacted. He thought it might be minimum because it <pb n="313" xml:id="pg_313" facs="0333"/>was his impression that the villages
                            are fairly self-contained units psychologically and are relatively
                            indifferent to the fate of the other villages. He said there probably
                            would be certain bad reactions by mistakes which would make it more
                            difficult to reclaim previous Viet Cong controlled villages which may
                            have been attacked but thought in general the application of air power
                            was being handled properly.</p>
                        <p>11) <hi rend="italic">Delta Plan</hi>. The original concept paper<note n="2" xml:id="d149fn2">
                                <ref target="#d113">Document 113</ref>.</note> has been approved by
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> but he does not know
                            about the four implementing instructions. He said he hopes they do not
                            publish them widely because it would assist the Viet Cong. However,
                            instructions must be issued. Question in his mind is whether the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would modify them.</p>
                        <p>12) <hi rend="italic">Chain of Command</hi>. Unfortunately, almost all of
                            the province chiefs are Army officers. He has suggested that they all be
                            put in civilian clothes to emphasize the civilian function of their
                            work. Acting as they do, as military men, the Regimental Command of the
                                <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> is presently wasted. The
                            Province Chief should rely on the Regimental Commander as his military
                            arm. Now battalions are scattered all around the provinces under the
                            Province Chief. He said if he had his way he would cut the telephone
                            lines between Province Chiefs and <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>, in order to prevent the present crossing of
                            wires.</p>
                        <p>13) <hi rend="italic">Intelligence</hi>. Much should be done. Self
                            Defense Corps should be basic intelligence unit “winkling out” the Viet
                            Cong from the villages, collecting intelligence through the villagers
                            and in sounding the alarm when attacked.</p>
                        <p>14) <hi rend="italic">POWs.</hi> In Malaya they sorted them out into
                            white, gray, and black. The whites were given relative freedom and
                            attempts were made to reintegrate them quickly back into society. The
                            gray took longer treatment and the blacks were hard-core Commies. The
                            only occasional success they had with the blacks was to use an ex-Commie
                            who was smarter than the black. They found that the blacks all had a
                            certain fixed conviction which could not be shaken except by an ex
                                Commie.<note n="3" xml:id="d149fn3">At this point is the following
                                notation in an unidentified hand: “As I heard it, 'which could be
                                shaken by a smarter ex-commie, and which had to be replaced by

                        <p>15) <hi rend="italic">Length of the War</hi>. The Malayan emergency
                            lasted twelve years but after the first six years the battle had
                            essentially been won. The last six was a mop-up operation. Some factors
                            are more favorable in Viet-Nam but some less. <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> said he would not like to
                            have this go on record, but a rough guess would be not less than three
                            years to win the main battle and it might be five or six. One of the
                            main favorable factors is the remarkable vigor and strength of the
                            Vietnamese villagers <pb n="314" xml:id="pg_314" facs="0334"/>which has
                            been true historically. One of the more unfavorable factors is that
                            Viet-Nam is bordered by three sanctuaries, Cambodia, Laos and North
                            Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>16) <hi rend="italic">Crop Destruction</hi>. This should be left for the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. Foreigners should not be
                            actively involved. At present there is no shortage of food for the Viet
                            Cong so efforts at crop destruction would probably not be too effective.
                            After provinces have been all cleared of Viet Cong then crop destruction
                            would work more effectively. In Malaya they did very little by air. Most
                            of it was done on the ground when they ran into patches in the jungle
                            which were being used by the terrorists.</p>
                        <p>17) <hi rend="italic"> Montagnards </hi>. They have been badly treated to
                            date because the Vietnamese have failed to appreciate the differences
                            and make allowances for tribal customs and ways of life which were
                            different from the rest of the Vietnamese. Important point is if the
                            Montagnards are on the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> side no Viet
                            Cong could exist in the jungle.</p>
                        <p>18) <hi rend="italic"> Rangers </hi>. Most important that rangers be put
                            back in their proper role. They should be trained to work in the jungle
                            for up to six weeks at a stretch. At present they are unwilling to live
                            in the jungle longer than a week or so. The secret is that ranger
                            companies must deliberately get lost from the Viet Cong. At that point
                            they become extremely dangerous because the Viet Cong movements are
                            hampered by the very fact that they don't know where the ranger
                            companies may be.</p>
                        <p>19) <hi rend="italic">Casualties</hi>. After the security structures are
                            in place and Viet-Cong casualties go up their recruiting afterward
                            becomes very difficult. Morale sags fast among terrorists who are hit
                            frequently and hard. One of the principal weaknesses of the guerrillas
                            is that they must carry off their wounded. This has a bad effect on the
                            remainder particularly if they are unable to leave them in villages for
                            medical attention.</p>
                        <p>20) <hi rend="italic">Civic Action</hi>. The Ministry is not so good and
                            Corps has touch of the old Hitler youth. The idea of arming them is
                            wrong because Civic Action people should not be soldiers or intelligence
                            officers, otherwise they reinforce the distrust of the district and
                            provincial officers. They should be used as manpower to join those under
                            orders of the provincial and district officials. Most important, Civic
                            Action Teams should not usurp the functions of other Departments. For
                            instance, the Health Department and the Education Department should be
                            relied upon for those services in Civic Action.</p>
                        <p>21) <hi rend="italic">Multi-National Effort</hi>. This has certain
                            political advantages in spreading the load and responsibilities but from
                            the Vietnamese point of view we are all tarred with the same brush. Only
                            the Vietnamese should shoot Vietnamese. This is a <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> war against Vietnamese terrorist
                            intruders. We should help but not get out and fight or turn it into a
                            multi-national war against the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <pb n="315" xml:id="pg_315" facs="0335"/>
                        <p>22) <hi rend="italic">
                                <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> vs Viet Cong Dedication</hi>.
                            Ideology doesn't play too strong a role since 70-80% of the Viet Cong
                            are locals. They are fighting for reasons other than Communist ideology,
                            Nationalism being one of the strongest. The <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> chaps seem to be well motivated against the Communists
                            but many of them have been fighting too long and need a rest.<note n="4" xml:id="d149fn4">At this point is the following notation in an
                                unidentified hand: “Hence, 1,000 desertions/month!”</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>23) <hi rend="italic">Information</hi>. This is one of the weakest links
                            and is not properly organized yet. Radio, newspapers, pamphlets,
                            propaganda need coordinating so that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is telling the same story through all media. The
                            political and psychological barrier against the Viet Cong should be done
                            through proper information.</p>
                        <p>24) <hi rend="italic">Terminology</hi>. Although it seems rather
                            inconsequential it is important to get the labels straight. For
                            instance, the use of “psywar” is often misused in connection with
                            friendly population instead of enemy. Another example is Viet Cong,
                            dignifying them by labeling them as Vietnamese whereas in Malaya they
                            deliberately called them “Communist terrorists”. A number of these
                            labels should be adjusted if possible.</p>
                        <p>25) <hi rend="italic">Administration</hi>. The villages are the best
                            administrative units in Viet-Nam and the central government probably has
                            the poorest administration. In Malaya the Government still practices the
                            way they were taught by the British, namely, that the decisions of the
                            Cabinet were relayed to the various ministries in clear written form.
                            The ministries then had the authority they needed to proceed. <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> said he might be able to make
                            an impression on the Vietnamese Government to follow the administrative
                            line in a saner fashion. He said <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> was very receptive to the idea and urged him to
                            hammer on these points with <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>.
                            For tactical reasons, <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName>
                            said, he thought it was a mistake to press too many “reforms” at one
                            time and up to this point he was concentrating on getting the village
                            system set up with adequate security. When he goes back he will pursue
                            some other ideas including this administrative one. He said he thought
                            it was vital to get our priorities straight in Viet-Nam. The security
                            system comes first and the rest later. He said he thought the next six
                            months would be vital in determining whether the villages were going to
                            be able to reorganize themselves in all fields to achieve ultimate
                            success. In the meantime the foreigners should provide and assist and
                            advise [as] unobtrusively as possible.</p>

                            there are still certain exceptions. Davis has been working constantly
                            and effectively on this and related problems. Given scope and magnitude
                            US assistance, however, attainment our objectives will require

                        <p>2. The Communist view on accommodation would be ascertained through
                            approaches by India or the USSR. Any subsequent agreement would be

                        <p>4. In any event, the US should resist further increases in US personnel

                        <p>1. The US involvement in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> should be
                            reduced at the first favorable moment although it is recognized this may
                            not be possible in the near future.</p>
                        <p>2. A US position should be prepared now on the anticipated report from

                        <p>3. It is not advisable to reconvene a Geneva conference or to seek a
                            neutral solution in Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>4. We should not actively work against <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> because there is nobody to replace him.</p>

                            proposals pose certain basic considerations which should be faced, at
                            least informally, before we move too far toward accommodation:</p>
                        <p>1. What are the US objectives in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and
                            Southeast Asia and what are the prospects of achieving those
                            objectives?</p>
                        <p>2. Is the establishment of a neutral belt in Southeast Asia a practical
                            concept and does it satisfy US objectives in the area?</p>
                        <p>3. The Geneva Accords of 1954 were formulated prior to Communist
                            intrusions into Laos. Should we initiate action for accommodation in
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> before the particulars of a Laos
                            settlement are known and tested?</p>

                            this would work. He anticipates no trouble since <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> sits on strategic hamlets

                            capacity as Coordinating SecState for Security.</p>
                        <p> Lac told us President has not yet approved four “instructions” under
                            overall Delta Pacification Directive on coordination. strategic hamlets,
                            population control and civic action. Lac himself in process studying
                            drafts of these instructions with view toward recommending to <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> and President form they should
                            take and any substantive changes he considers necessary.</p>
                        <p>Specific problem on which he focusing is coordinating mechanism in corps
                            tactical zones, specifically 5th, 7th and 21st Division areas in 3rd
                            Corps tactical zone. Lac inclined recommend formula that Division
                            commander should be head of coordinating committee because of his
                            control of troops which may have to be used outside as well as within
                            area encompassed in Delta Pacification Plan. Exception might be made in
                            case of General Cao, whose pacification operations in 5th Division area
                            already well advanced.</p>
                        <p> Lac now beginning assemble his staff but evidently this is going to take
                            time. He feels (and we agree) that it would be wiser use personnel who
                            will be permanent members his staff to conduct studies in provinces as
                            base for developing pacification planning rather than drawing in
                            temporary personnel. He quite prepared that we work with him on these
                            planning studies in provinces.</p>
                        <p>As foreshadowed <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> province
                            studies moving in different direction from earlier generalized
                            provincial surveys. Can be expected new studies in conjunction Lac and
                            his staff will be keyed closely to specific pacification planning needs.
                            We are sure Dept will agree this is desirable shift in emphasis. Appears
                            to us under these circumstances that Americans working with Lac and his
                            staff on province studies should be those who will continue work with
                            him and lower echelon Vietnamese officials in execution plans in order
                            maintain continuity of familiarity with situation and what is being done
                            about it. Will be desirable also associate USOM directly with these
                            studies and believe in view Lac's present attitude this should be
                            readily possible.</p>
                        <p>In view length time which may still be involved before new type province

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWG1">Stoneman</persName> explained that he had

                            of the Vietnam Task Force, to be co-chairman of this meeting, which had
                            grown far beyond what had originally been intended, namely, an informal
                            discussion between himself and a few DOD officials on the current status
                            and problems of civic action in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>It was recognized at the outset that the questions being discussed at
                            this meeting were dependent more on action by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and U.S. Missions co-ordination in
                            Saigon than on Washington action. It was also pointed out that recent

                            field which appears necessary to enable Washington to more effectively
                            support field endeavors in civic action.</p>
                        <p>The meeting agenda consisted essentially of the following series of
                            questions with an attempt to formulate lines of action for dealing with
                            them:</p>
                        <p>1. What is the relationship among civic action (which by definition is
                            performed by military forces), rural development (as supported by <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>), and other programs supported by
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> … ? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWG1">Stoneman</persName> proposed that the principal
                            focus of action be on how to <pb n="321" xml:id="pg_321" facs="0341"/>help the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to gain and hold the
                            allegiance of the rural population throughout Vietnam without respect to
                            bureaucratic considerations as to whether it is technically civic action
                            being done by military types, or rural development being done by
                            civilians being supported by <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. It was emphasized that the sweep of action which is
                            necessary to make the pacification program a success in Vietnam requires
                            that help to the villages be a continuum and not unduly segmented
                            because of agency and funding categories. It was proposed that in all
                            planning and staff work with respect to this problem, the focus be on
                            continuous attention to the villages and that, to this end, the phrase
                            “Civic Action (military)—Rural Development” be employed. It is hoped
                            that this approach will help assure that there are not gaps between
                            various agency functions, and that in Washington staff work attention
                            will be focused on the total spectrum of what is being done for the
                            rural population, rather than on individual agency's program.</p>
                        <p>2. What is the co-ordinating mechanism in being, and what new might be
                            needed, with respect to military-civil activities (a) within the
                            Vietnamese government, (b) within U.S. agencies in Vietnam, and (c)
                            within U.S. agencies in Washington? Some discussion revolved around the
                            fact that the Ministry of Civic Action of the Vietnamese Government is
                            in fact concerned with civilian-type assistance to the villagers. It was
                            also pointed out that by virtue of their superior organization and
                            staffing, the Vietnamese military have more capability than the civil
                            agencies for civic action-type work.</p>
                        <p>With respect to co-ordination of U.S. agencies in Saigon, it was
                            suggested by some that this was quite effective, but there remains an
                            uneasy feeling that there seemed to be several unexplained gaps in
                            information and the flow of work that might indicate that more effective
                            co-ordination is yet to be desired. There was discussion as to whether a
                            single director should be appointed to preside over all U.S. agencies'
                            efforts within any particular field, such as medical services.</p>
                        <p>With respect to co-ordination in Washington, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWG1">Stoneman</persName> (with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCB1">Wood</persName>'s concurrence) suggested that
                            closer and more regular interagency co-ordination might be fruitful, but
                            that in lieu of any more standing committees, this need be met by adding
                            a regular civic action agenda item to the weekly meetings of the Vietnam
                            Task Force. Among other things, this would frequently bring civic action
                            specialists into the TF/VN forum. Emphasis would be more on solving
                            problems than on formal reports.</p>
                        <p>3. Considerable discussion revolved around whether a problem in fact
                            remained with respect to the reported inability to use <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> funds for certain types of civilian aid
                            such as medicines to be dispensed to civilians by VN military civic
                            action teams, and as to whether there were <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> procedural blocks to the fullest of <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> support of military <pb n="322" xml:id="pg_322" facs="0342"/>civic action activities. It was widely
                            agreed that what is needed is a completely integrated approach to the
                            basic problem of pacification in Vietnam, and that there needs to be
                            complete flexibility with respect to cross-servicing between the U.S.
                            military and civilian agencies with the primary criteria being (a) what
                            is the need, (b) who can best meet it within the time-frame involved.
                            Specific questions regarding such things as cross-servicing on medical
                            supplies and on personnel are to be vigorously explored among various
                            agency staff members present.</p>

                        <p>Circular 1730. 1. Department seriously concerned by impression created by
                            some press reports that the war in Viet-Nam is a U.S. war, and which
                            imply that it is war which U.S. is directing, in which U.S. is
                            participating and for which U.S. is responsible. Critics of our present
                            policy emphasize “growing U.S. involvement,” “U.S. moral
                            responsibilities,” and similar concepts, as well as role of U.S.
                            military personnel. This erroneous impression carries two dangers: a)
                            adverse international reaction to assumed U.S. involvement and b)
                            psychological support for Viet Cong who can gain popular backing from
                            nationalists and anti-colonialists by pointing to conspicuous U.S.
                            military role and portraying U.S. as assuming former French
                            dominance.</p>
                        <pb n="324" xml:id="pg_324" facs="0344"/>
                        <p>2. This impression is factually wrong and lacking perspective. Purpose
                            this message therefore is to enjoin on all posts in discussing Viet-Nam
                            war to avoid above terms but rather to make following points:</p>
                        <p>a. U.S. has given Viet-Nam military assistance since 1950 and at <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> request this assistance has been
                            expanded in the past two years to help <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> defeat the Communist subversive aggression.</p>
                        <p>b. Assistance consists of materiel and equipment for Vietnamese security
                            forces; advisers to these forces; and air transport capabilities, cargo
                            planes and helicopters, to supplement presently inadequate Vietnamese
                            capabilities.</p>
                        <p>c. U.S. military personnel are not participating directly in war nor are
                            they directing war. Major U.S. effort is to train instructors rather
                            than troops. However, given fluidity and ubiquity of guerrilla warfare,
                            necessarily Americans suffer occasional casualties in carrying out their
                            training and logistical functions—e.g., taking part in training patrol
                            exercises.</p>
                        <p>d. In view of the seriousness of the Viet Cong aggression U.S. effort
                            consequently substantial. Quite naturally American correspondents find
                            U.S. effort most newsworthy subject for American public. This emphasis
                            however tends distort facts: it is Vietnamese war. They are fighting it
                            and retain full responsibility for it. U.S. role is limited to assisting
                            them in maintaining independence.</p>

                        <p>Policy Toward Vietnam</p>
                        <p>Comments concerning Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName>'s memorandum of 4 April 1962 on the subject of
                            Vietnam are submitted in response to your request.</p>
                        <p>The burden of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName>'s
                            proposals appears to be that present US policy toward Vietnam should be
                            revised in order to seek a political solution to the problem of
                            Communist penetration in the area. The effect of these proposals is to
                            put the United States in a position of initiating negotiations with the
                            Communists to seek disengagement from what is by now a well-known
                            commitment to take a forthright stand against Communism in Southeast
                            Asia. The various measures approved for implementation by the United
                            States in support of our objectives in South Vietnam have not yet been
                            underway long enough to demonstrate their full effectiveness. Any
                            reversal of US policy could have disastrous effects, not only upon our
                            relationship with South Vietnam, but with the rest of our Asian and
                            other allies as well.</p>
                        <p>We accept the judgment of the U.S. intelligence community expressed in
                                <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> 10-62 (21 February 1962) as
                            follows: “The long-range Communist Bloc objectives in Southeast Asia are
                            to eliminate U.S. influence and presence and to establish Communist
                            regimes throughout the area. Although the Communist powers have some
                            differences of view as to tactics and priorities and the risks to be run
                            in <pb n="326" xml:id="pg_326" facs="0346"/>pursuing their objectives,
                            they have thus far maintained a basic unity of ultimate objectives and a
                            high degree of policy coordination with respect to Southeast Asia.”</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> may not be
                            aware that although our military assistance and support of South Vietnam
                            has grown, our military commitment has continued as stated in your
                            letter of 14 December 1961 to President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>: “Your letter underlines what our own information
                            has convincingly shown—that the campaign of force and terror now being
                            waged against your people and your Government is supported and directed
                            from the outside by the authorities at Hanoi… .<note n="5" xml:id="d156fn5">These and following ellipses are in the source
                                text.</note> In response to your request, we are prepared to help
                            the Republic of Vietnam to protect its people and to preserve its
                            independence. We shall promptly increase our assistance to your defense
                            effort… . If the Communist authorities in North Vietnam will stop their
                            campaign to destroy the Republic of Vietnam, the measures we are taking
                            to assist your defense efforts will no longer be necessary.”</p>
                        <p>Our present policy in South Vietnam does contain some risk of military
                            escalation. The alternative is U.S. withdrawal, which is tantamount to
                            abandoning South Vietnam to the Communists. The Department of Defense
                            considers this unacceptable. To prevent the fall of South Vietnam to
                            Communist aggression and subsequent loss of the remainder of the
                            Southeast Asian mainland must remain our unalterable objective. The
                            military considerations involved are clear. Also of major importance is
                            the psychological impact that a firm position by the United States will
                            have on the countries of the world—both free and Communist. South
                            Vietnam is a testing ground of U.S. resolution in Asia.</p>
                        <p>More important than these immediate losses are the eventualities which
                            could follow for the remainder of non-Communist Asia.</p>
                        <p>The problems raised by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> with regard to our present policy have been
                            considered in the coordinated development of that policy. There follows
                            discussion of several points in Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName>'s memorandum which are seriously questioned by
                            the Department of Defense.</p>
                        <p>There is general recognition of the deficiencies of the present
                            Government of Vietnam. At the same time it should be recognized that the
                            Government also has notable strengths and has recently taken measures to
                            increase its popular support and to mobilize the entire country in
                            support of the war effort. The present policy of supporting the
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> regime, while applying
                            continued pressure for improvement, appears to be the only practicable
                            alternative at this time</p>
                        <pb n="327" xml:id="pg_327" facs="0347"/>
                        <p>The parallel between the present U.S. and past French roles in Vietnam is
                            unjustified. The following statement in your State of the Union Address
                            bears on this point: “The systematic aggression now bleeding that
                            country is not a ‘war of liberation’—for Vietnam is already free. It is
                            a war of attempted subjugation and it will be resisted.” French forces
                            participated directly in the prior struggle; U.S. personnel have only an
                            indirect role and are not subject to “bleeding” in the sense
                            implied.</p>
                        <p>We are mindful of the probability that the Communists will attempt to
                            identify the U.S. with initially unpopular measures associated with
                            pacification. Accordingly, the activities of our advisors are being
                            regulated to avoid conspicuous participation in these measures.</p>
                        <p>We concur that the door must be kept open for a political solution, but
                            the policy advanced by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> does not address the basic problem. His
                            proposal contains the essential elements sought by the Communists for
                            their takeover by providing a set of rules which the free world would be
                            forced to obey, while the Communists secretly break the rules to gain
                            their objective. The Department of Defense concurs with Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> in his statement of 1
                            March 1962: “In reference to the demand by the Communists that the
                            co-Chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference and other countries concerned
                            consult regarding Vietnam, the U.S. is always willing to talk about
                            situations which represent a threat to the peace, but what must be
                            talked about is the root of the trouble; in this case it is the
                            Communist aggression in Vietnam in disregard of the Geneva Accords… .
                            There can be peace overnight in Vietnam if those responsible for the
                            aggression wish peace. The situation is just as simple as that.”<note n="6" xml:id="d156fn6">See <ref target="#d94">Document
                                94</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>It must be recognized that a suspension of Viet Cong activity would be
                            readily terminable by the Communists and is not a concession equivalent
                            to a “standstill on an introduction of men and material” and “phased
                            American withdrawal.” Such withdrawal would leave South Vietnam
                            incapable of continuing development of a permanent basis for resisting
                            Communist subversion and would be, in fact, a surrender of Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Because of the foregoing, the Department of Defense cannot concur in the
                            policy advanced by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName>, but believes strongly that present policy
                            toward South Vietnam should be pursued vigorously to a successful
                            conclusion.</p>

                            that headway is being made in areas other than military as, for
                            instance, issuance of Civic Action Program on 28 Mar by Jt General
                            Staff. However, there are reasons not to be starry-eyed.</p>

                            The outstanding ingredient still lacking is efficient administration and
                            coordination of the several programs. Further reforms are still

                        <p>1309. <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>'s reiterated public
                            urgings of international conference on Vietnam cause us growing concern.
                            We believe that, unless prompt action is taken to put forth United
                            States position of opposition to such conference, our political position
                            vis-à-vis <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will be impaired and, even
                            more importantly, confidence of Vietnamese people and armed forces in
                            United States support in war with Viet Cong may begin to waver.</p>
                        <p>Carefully nurtured efforts over past year by President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>'s statements and letters to
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>, Vice President
                                <persName>Johnson</persName>'s visit to Vietnam and <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>-Rostow mission to maintain
                            confidence of Vietnamese in United States may well be brought to naught
                            unless this move toward international conference on Vietnam is spiked as
                            far as United States is concerned. <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>'s frequent headway to draw analogy between
                            conference on Laos and conference he pushing on Vietnam is very thing
                            most likely to raise serious doubts in Vietnamese minds about future
                            United States intentions.</p>
                        <p>We believe therefore as a minimum United States should (a) make clear to
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> its opposition to
                            international conference on Vietnam (realizing that position conveyed to
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> will almost
                            certainly be made public by him) and (b) inform <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> what we are telling <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>. We believe for sake our
                            position among Vietnamese people and armed forces as well as to show
                            international opinion clearly our stand on this issue it would be
                            preferable for United States to make its own position public immediately
                            after informing <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>.</p>
                        <p>We recommend substance United States position be as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. Only issue for current discussion re Vietnam is cessation of
                            aggression by Communist regime of North Vietnam against people and
                            legally constituted government of South Vietnam. United States is quite
                            prepared discussion this issue bilaterally through diplomatic channels
                            with appropriate countries (meaning UK and USSR but without saying so
                            publicly) in order make clear that its extraordinary military <pb n="330" xml:id="pg_330" facs="0350"/>assistance measures to Republic
                            of Vietnam will cease once guerrilla war in South Vietnam directed and
                            supported by Communist regime in Hanoi has come to halt.</p>
                        <p>2. Since this is only issue for discussion and United States message on
                            this score can be conveyed through bilateral channels to those whom it
                            concerns, there is no reason at all in United States view to consider
                            calling international conference on Vietnam and United States does not
                            intend to consider matter further.</p>
                        <p>3. International conference already held on Vietnam at Geneva in 1954
                            agreed on cease-fire in Vietnam. United States and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> have consistently respected this
                            provision for sake of maintenance of peace. It is however Communist
                            regime of North Vietnam which by its guerrilla war against Republic of
                            Vietnam has upset the peace and stability established in Vietnam by the
                            international conference held in 1954. There is no point whatsoever in
                            convening a new international conference on Vietnam involving Communist
                            regime in North Vietnam since it is violating basic purpose of Geneva
                            Conference of 1954—re-establishment of peace in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>4. As for idea neutralizing of South Vietnam sometimes bruited about, it
                            is evident that peace of Vietnam and of Southeast Asia would be much
                            better assured if it were North Vietnam that were neutralized since it
                            is present Communist regime in that area that has upset the peace.</p>

                            pilots bombed the palace and <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>
                                escaped.<note n="2" xml:id="d159fn2">See <ref target="#d87">Documents 87</ref> and <ref target="#d88">88</ref>.</note> This
                            action set off full-scale plotting against <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> to <pb n="331" xml:id="pg_331" facs="0351"/>the
                            extent that there are now three principal groups which have been
                            organized to take over the country at the slightest provocation or
                            opportunity.</p>
                        <p>The first group is composed mostly of political leaders and <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s brother has even expressed his
                            support of this particular element. A second group is a mixture of
                            lesser political and lesser military personalities and is considered
                            less likely than the other two to achieve success. The third group is
                            potentially the most powerful since it controls the Armed Forces and can
                            easily assume control of the Government. The leading figure is the
                            Commanding General of the Army Field Command.</p>
                        <p>While no disaffection has yet appeared, it nevertheless seems certain
                            that <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> will be overthrown.
                            This would resolve one of the comparative minor problems of his conduct
                            of government along lines suggested by the United States. However,
                            precipitant action by one of these groups could well reverse the trend
                            toward liberalism which <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> has
                            begun to observe.</p>

                        <p>1311. Task Force Viet Nam. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> called me in April 16 to discuss question of crop
                            defoliation. He made clear that he is as much in favor of this program
                            as ever and indeed regards its implementation as “one-third of the
                            battle” in the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> controlled areas where
                            he wants to use it. In this conversation, he also showed much greater
                            awareness of the need to employ crop defoliants with discrimination,
                            i.e., in such a way as to avoid destruction of non-<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> crops. <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> also emphasized that a prompt decision is necessary
                            if another growing season is not to be missed.</p>
                        <p>I recalled to <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> that I had
                            previously told him that at the last <gloss target="#t_SecDef1">SecDef</gloss> meeting in Honolulu<note n="2" xml:id="d160fn2">See
                                    <ref target="#d124">Document 124</ref>.</note> it had been
                            agreed that Washington would be asked to give us authority here in
                            Saigon to authorize crop <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332" facs="0352"/>defoliation missions on a case by case basis. We had not yet received
                            such authorization but he would appreciate that this was a difficult
                            problem for the US Government.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> said that Colonel Trach
                            (Vietnamese head of CDTC) had charge of this matter on Vietnamese side
                            and was making careful study of suitable targets. He proposed that
                            representatives of Colonel Trach and US representatives jointly overfly
                            possible targets, map them and reach joint assessment of their
                            suitability for defoliation. I agreed to put this proposal to my
                            government.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> and I
                            recommend that we be authorized to participate in joint target
                            assessment with Vietnamese and again request authority to authorize
                            Vietnamese crop defoliation missions on case by case basis.</p>

                        <p>Dear Cot: In certain <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>
                            contingency plans the question arises of what our aims would be if
                            military operations should ever develop against North Viet-Nam. That is,
                            would we include the reunification of Viet-Nam by military means as one
                            of our aims?<note n="2" xml:id="d161fn2">Next to this sentence the word
                                “No” was written.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>As far as I can determine our position on the reunification of Viet-Nam
                            remains that set forth in the Bedell Smith declaration of July 21, 1954
                            at Geneva<note n="3" xml:id="d161fn3">For <persName corresp="#p_SBK1">Smith</persName>'s declaration, see <ref target="frus1952-54v16">

                        <p>“In connection with the statement in the declaration concerning free
                            elections in Viet-Nam my Government wishes to make clear its position
                            which it has expressed in a declaration made in Washington on June 29,
                            1954 as follows:</p>
                        <p>“'In the case of nations, now divided against their will, we shall
                            continue to seek to achieve unity through free elections, supervised by
                            the United Nations to insure that they are conducted fairly.'”</p>
                        <pb n="333" xml:id="pg_333" facs="0353"/>
                        <p>I have seen no new policy pronouncements on this subject.<note n="4" xml:id="d161fn4">Next to this sentence were written the words: “I
                                believe this is correct.”</note> Therefore, I assume that
                            reunification of Viet-Nam by peaceful means continues to be our
                            objective. I also assume, however, that reunification of Viet-Nam by
                            military means would not be an aim of any military operations which
                            might develop against North Viet-Nam short of a general war situation. I
                            should be interested in any information you may have as to whether or
                            not these assumptions are correct.</p>

                        <p>Recent assessments of the situation in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> stress that future success depends on the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> ability to correlate diverse
                            administrative requirements to implement the pacification strategy.</p>
                        <p>Doubts are expressed that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> can
                            achieve this task. <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> has
                            created a number of committees and councils in the past 3-4 months
                            ostensibly designed to decentralize administrative control. No observer
                            feels confident that these actions will be, or are, effective; the same
                            deficiencies noted during the period of your mission prevail.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> continues
                            to resist basic improvements recommended by the US. <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> has met a similar response
                            when he engages in discussion of details. The Ambassador, General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>, and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName>, from contact on
                            the ground, caution slowness in pressing <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> along these lines.</p>
                        <p>The US, however, has executed in full measure its commitments to
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>, which stemmed from your
                            mission, and assumed thereby a degree of responsibility for success. A
                            vital part of the US-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> contract was
                            recognition that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> should seek
                            improvement in administration and public image. Few think the victory
                            can be won if <pb n="334" xml:id="pg_334" facs="0354"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> does not take steps toward
                            limited liberalization of his regime. To assist him, the US offered, on
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> concurrence, to provide selected
                            advisers on a mutually acceptable basis; <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> has not chosen to take up this proposal.</p>
                        <p>The question now is whether the US should continue to exert such
                            influence it can on <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> and hope
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> can do the job, or should it
                            insist on certain minimum actions which will increase the odds that the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will do the job.</p>
                        <p>This issue was a difficult one last November and a source of US-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> disagreement. Nevertheless, it is
                            important we develop some sort of rationale on the problem. I suggest
                            that this is the time for State to study the prospects in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. Recommendations should be made as to
                            whether we should expect Diem to respond more positively in accordance
                            with our jointly undertaken agreement or, alternatively, if a projection
                            of present levels of progress represents a risk of future increased US
                            involvement.</p>

                        <p>a. State is in receipt of a telegram from Saigon (we do not yet have)
                            requesting authority to allow Viet-Nam to use US chemicals to spray Viet
                            Cong crops.<note n="2" xml:id="d163fn2">
                                <ref target="#d160">Document 160</ref>.</note> Saigon suggests the
                            US join with the Vietnamese in identifying targets and recommends that
                            the Ambassador be given authority to approve such Vietnamese operations
                            on a case by case basis. This telegram formalizes the oral request made

                            Honolulu 22 March, which has not been acted on by State. In <persName corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName>'s absence, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCB1">Wood</persName> gave the usual State discourse on
                            the adverse effects of using defoliants regardless of selective
                            targetting.</p>

                        <p>b. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCB1">Wood</persName> suggested to <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> that action should be taken to obtain
                            foreign doctors for use in Viet-Nam without waiting further for answers
                            to outstanding telegrams on this subject which have been sent to Saigon.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCB1">Wood</persName> mentioned the
                            Presidential interest in creating an atmosphere of international support
                            for the <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> Government. There were some
                            differences of opinion on whether this should be acted on immediately or
                            whether Saigon should be pushed for an answer. The issue was left
                            dangling.</p>
                        <p>c. There was a very interesting and concise briefing by an <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> Communications Specialist, Dr.
                            Winfield, who had just resumed from a short survey trip to South
                            Viet-Nam. He indicated progress was being made in the installation of
                            community listening equipment in the villages; the recently commenced
                            rural newspaper was off to an excellent start; and bids had been
                            received from US and Japanese sources for transistor radio receivers for
                            distribution throughout South Viet-Nam. The tentative decision on the
                            receivers is to use US sources entirely, some of which will be delivered
                            as assembled sets while others will be shipped in units for assembly in
                            Saigon. The estimate is 4 to 6 months before the first of these
                            receivers is ready for distribution by sale or, as an alternative, by
                            buying through the US economic assistance program and distributing
                            without cost to the populace. In the meantime, Dr. Winfield felt the
                            normal sales of transistor receivers in Saigon was resulting in some of
                            the distribution that we desired.</p>
                        <p>d. He also reported on the status of transmitters which the US is
                            installing in South Viet-Nam. The 5 main transmitters should be on the
                            air by June (2 or 3 of these are operating now). Tests indicate coverage
                            of all South Viet-Nam except an area in the Kontum-Pleiku Plateau;
                            possible installation of a 1 KW transmitter at Pleiku to cover this
                            section is under study. A directional antenna for the HVE transmitter is
                            being installed and, when operational, will permit radio coverage of all
                            of North Viet-Nam, except the northern and western border areas.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Winfield emphasized that we are rapidly approaching the point when
                            South Viet-Nam will have a very modem and extensive system to promulgate
                            information throughout the country. The content of such information, as
                            now produced by South Viet-Nam, is ineffective. There is an urgent need
                            that US advice and experience in this field be utilized by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. So far all such approaches have been
                            unsuccessful. Dr. Winfield recommends a firm approach at a high
                            level.</p>

                            desire to extend my range of concern I continue think that South Vietnam

                            reference telegram. While respecting your judgment as to the timing of
                            any conference, the latter could be extremely useful in moving this from
                            a military to a diplomatic solution and search for diplomatic solutions
                            is after all the business of diplomacy.<note n="3" xml:id="d164fn3">Next

                            conference to consider ways of getting full observance<note n="4" xml:id="d164fn4">Next to this sentence were written the words

                            effect of course would be to focus world public opinion on the issue and
                            as the Laos cease-fire has shown this can have a restraining
                            influence.</p>
                        <p>I also take strong exception to the cliché which is so persistently
                            damaging in our diplomacy that we must subordinate our policy to
                            whatever will maintain the confidence of the regime to which we are
                            accredited. This leads us to the absurdity that any action, however
                            sensible, may undermine confidence if it doesn't fit the particular
                            preferences of the government we are supporting. <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> suggests that confidence of
                            Vietnam people and war with Viet Cong may begin to waver if we show
                            disposition to diplomatic discussion. In fact they should never be in
                            any doubt about our preference for diplomatic settlement.</p>
                        <p>Finally I confess to some concern over the attitudes exemplified in the
                            first paragraph of reference telegram. If we must fear losing our
                            position vis-à-vis a government as utterly dependent on our military and
                            charitable support as that of <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> our diplomacy is in a sorry condition. And if we
                            can only inspire confidence by emphasizing willingness to fight war we
                            are in even worse shape and ought to get Dulles back to take charge. I
                            would also note typical tendency in telegram to identify the people with
                            Diem and vice versa, an identification which no close observer of the
                            South Vietnam scene can take seriously.</p>

                        <p rend="center">5-20 APRIL 1962</p>
                        <p>The following summarizes principal impressions of my recent trip to the
                            Far East. I am aware of the dangers of reaching conclusions on the basis
                            of hit-and-run visits, but since I had had fifteen months of daily
                            concern with one aspect or another of our problems in the Far East, and
                            my sources of information were themselves very much attuned to the
                            situations in their own countries, I was able to get quickly to the
                            point in most cases. And, because it was known that I served in Asia
                            with Asian troops two years in World War II, I was received with genuine
                            trust.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Comments</hi>—I found the President bright and serious
                            and talkative. As is well known, he is unwilling to delegate authority
                            sufficiently and appears adamant about maintaining a dual chain of
                            command for military operations, but he still seems to be far and away
                            the best man for us to rely upon. In this regard I found the feeling
                            among the U.S. <pb n="338" xml:id="pg_338" facs="0358"/>on Saigon that
                            those South Vietnamese intellectuals who oppose and criticize Diem seem
                            unable to convert their criticism into any form of constructive
                            assistance. He himself appears to have a very clear grasp of his
                            military problem. He has studied in great detail the causes of the
                            failures of the French and is determined not to repeat them.</p>
                        <p>My own eyes convinced me that the difficulty of terrain of which I had
                            heard so much for so long is not a myth but very real. It seems to me
                            important that key U.S. decision makers find the time to look for
                            themselves at this country.</p>
                        <p>The Vietnamese are greatly encouraged by our policy toward them and by
                            our strong support. Slowly but surely they are working out the
                            techniques of counter-insurgency and of civic action. They seem fully
                            aware of the importance of associating the ideas of military and civic
                            actions in the minds of the villagers. They also realize the importance
                            of training villagers to perform civil guard and self-defense roles and
                            are facing up to the tough problem of having to keep the villages
                            protected while simultaneously conducting the training for the civil
                            guard and self-defense units. Gradually they are learning to use the new
                            techniques which we are making possible, such as the use of helicopters
                            and direction finding equipment. In this regard our buildup in their
                            country is very fast by their standards; we must be a little patient as
                            they try to assimilate the new resources and absorb the related
                            operational techniques.</p>
                        <p>The Armed Forces of South Vietnam are committed to a larger degree than I
                            had realized to the village defense and counter-insurgency roles. They
                            are so spread-eagled by these deployments that a conventional attack by
                            major units of the North Vietnam Armed Forces would present them with a
                            hard choice between concentrating to meet the conventional threat
                            (knowing full well that the rear areas would immediately erupt with
                            increased Vietcong activities), or alternatively, pitting small regular
                            Army forces against greatly superior conventional forces of North
                            Vietnam. As I see it, this clearly adds up to a requirement for us to
                            prepare to come quickly to their assistance if they are jumped by
                            conventional forces from North Vietnam. Ground combat troops could be
                            supplied by, e.g., the GRC and ROK, but our Naval and Air Forces could
                            play very important roles.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Laos, their “open back door,” they were too polite to
                            complain openly about our policy but referred over and over to the
                            extreme difficulty of cleaning up their country while the Vietcong have
                            such an opportune means of access. One of the South Vietnamese pointed
                            out the analogy of Greece, making the point that only when Tito closed
                            his border and denied the guerrillas both access and sanctuary were the
                            Greeks able to eradicate them from their country.</p>
                        <pb n="339" xml:id="pg_339" facs="0359"/>
                        <p>The Army of South Vietnam impressed me as one which, though certainly not
                            up to the standards of the Korean much less the Chinese Nationalist, is
                            nonetheless very promising. It has some good young officers and mostly
                            needs continued good training and experienced leadership. Within the
                            Army there is a recognition that the struggle will be long and
                            difficult, but, possibly for the first time, they believe there is
                            reason to be quietly optimistic about the long pull. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> has taken hold well. He
                            spends much time in the field and is at once firm and friendly in his
                            dealings with the Vietnamese. He and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> work well together.</p>
                        <p>There were a few random impressions worth noting. The feeling was
                            expressed by Minister <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> that
                            the mainland Chinese (and other Asians) have not been so brainwashed as
                            to have lost a basic good will toward the United States. They are
                            practical people who have duly noted our according independence to the
                            Philippines and who remember such things. He further expressed the
                            opinion that now is the time for the ChiNats to hit the ChiComs, a
                            feeling which he says he distinctly did not have at the time of Quemoy
                            and Matsu. He bases this estimate on his assessment of the bad
                            conditions in China and also North Vietnam. He added that the ChiComs
                            are putting the squeeze on North Vietnam in the same way the Russians
                            are squeezing the ChiComs. He said that the full impact of our decision
                            to keep South Vietnam free is greater than we may realize. He believes
                            it has actually recreated an opportunity to free Southeast Asia from
                            communism. He indicated quite spontaneously that his country is very
                            happy with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>
                            and that the Thais like Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName>.</p>
                        <p>A high-ranking and apparently able and astute Vietnamese officer
                            expressed his concern that we seem content to remain strategically,
                            strictly on the defensive in the field of guerrilla warfare. He pointed
                            out that there is always a great disparity in numbers between those who
                            fight as guerrillas and those who play the role of counter-guerrillas
                            (ratios of counter-guerrillas to guerrillas normally range from 10 to 1
                            to 20 or more to 1). He reasoned from this basic fact that we must
                            necessarily ourselves become the guerrillas and place the onus on the
                            communists to provide the much larger numbers of counter-guerrillas.</p>

                            of Geneva accords was to “freeze” balance of military power in Viet Nam.
                            From technical point of view justifying presence US military personnel
                            under wording article 16, would not appear necessary relate US military

                            Viet Nam in 1954. Article 16 prohibits introduction of “any troop

                            of units and groups of personnel, etc. without making distinction as to

                            Head of <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> in Saigon, gave a
                            debriefing on 19 April.</p>
                        <p>He covered a wide range of subjects, but in his own field of information
                            he made the following points of interest:</p>
                        <p>a. There are only 2 or 3 Vietnamese who are professionally qualified to
                            administer the information service, but they are not utilized. <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> continues to provide guidance
                            personally and it is ineffective.</p>
                        <p>b. US advice is given, but not followed except in technical areas. At the
                            same time, the US is providing most of the physical and technical means
                            for the <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> information program.</p>
                        <p>c. There are 25 <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> newspapers m Saigon;
                            none elsewhere. Deliveries to the provinces are infrequent and in small
                            quantity.</p>
                        <p>d. Sometime in the next 6-18 months the US will be faced with the
                            decision as to whether to use our resources unilaterally to project the
                            required <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> public image or to insist
                            on <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> (and
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>) accepting our counsel.</p>
                        <p>e. If the impact of the psychological assets are not altered to appeal to
                            the people, the growing <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> military
                            superiority will be of no avail.</p>

                            text. Following statements have come out of Hanoi past two days on
                            international consultations or conference on Vietnam:</p>
                        <p>1) On April 18 at close long report to current session <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> National Assembly on US “Colonial War”
                            in South Vietnam and the “just fight” of the South Vietnamese people,
                            Deputy Nguyen Van Vinh stated:</p>
                        <p>“Of late world opinion has paid attention to seeking measures to check
                            war and maintain peace in Indo-China—the proposal for reconvening the
                            Geneva conference, for instance. US have had to talk of international
                            conference on <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> question. But they
                            want to take advantage of this conference to slander Vietnamese people
                            and give fig leaf to their acts of aggression in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>“Since Geneva agreements have been sabotaged more and more seriously by
                            US and <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName>, it is very
                            necessary to reconvene Geneva conference to discuss Vietnamese question.
                            But this must aim at checking US intervention and fully achieving
                            sovereignty, unity, independence and territorial integrity of Vietnamese
                            people in keeping with spirit of 1954 Geneva agreements on
                            Indo-China”.</p>
                        <p> Vinh report also welcomes initiatives of bloc, <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> and “certain political circles
                            in Britain, India, France and elsewhere, aiming to maintain peace in
                            Vietnam and Indo-China”.</p>
                        <p> Vinh is also chairman of National Reunification Commission, post of

                            question. While he apparently spoke in capacity as Deputy, executive

                        <p>The main points made were:</p>
                        <p>a. There is confusion on both the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and
                            US side in Saigon, apparently due to organizational uncertainties. The
                            Ambassador and <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> have had long recent
                            conversations with <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> and are hopeful of some progress
                            in clearing lines of command. <persName corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName> is mulling over the idea of using lower
                            administrative levels as the point of contact for advice… . Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TWC2">Trueheart</persName> (<gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss>) thought this would be difficult to do
                            in other ministries.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> implied concern with past
                            experiences with advisors from Michigan State, and preferred to continue
                            profitable contacts with institutions such as Brookings, who were giving
                            them useful studies. The obvious impression was that there were enough
                            US advisors in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> without formalizing
                            specific positions.</p>
                        <p>(There is a renewed State interest in the whole matter of US advice; the
                            extent to which it is needed and the probable results if it is not
                            accepted by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.)</p>
                        <p>b. <persName corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName> is impressed with the
                            execution of air support in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, both US
                            and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. (This is a complete switch
                            based on his look on the ground and talks with Gen. LeMay.)</p>
                        <p>c. <persName corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName> backs selective
                            defoliation, including against <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> crops,
                            and thinks the chemicals will do the job against food crops. (This is
                            also a 180 degree turn resulting from talks with <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TWC2">Trueheart</persName>; the reason for his confidence in the
                            chemicals is not clear.) He recognizes some political hazards, but
                            considers them acceptable for the gains involved.</p>
                        <p>d. He talked with Mr. Walton, the <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>
                            police advisor. You will recall Walton was very critical last fall of
                            the situation in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. He now thinks
                            there is real improvement; the police link with the Surete is good, and
                            equipment and training facilities are improved.</p>
                        <p>e. US advisors to Province Chiefs are in place in 11 provinces. <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> is pushing for helos and vehicles
                            for provinces so the chiefs can get around; some have not visited the
                            greater majority of their villages because of the security
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>f. Implementation of Staley reforms has produced <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> budget shortages. <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
                            and State are studying this matter to see what can be done. A prime
                            factor is a general let-down in business activity.</p>
                        <p>g. In a talk with Gen. LeMay, <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>
                            produced a long shopping list of items desired. Included were jet T-33
                            aircraft, radars, ULA helicopters for province use, photo processing
                            facility, air photo capability.<note n="4" xml:id="d169fn4">A summary

                            used. He noted there is significant unused air capacity. He complained
                            that his people could not get by the Chief of Staff (Marine Gen. Weede)
                            to talk this over with Gen. <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>. (Gen. LeMay talked with Gen. <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> in Saigon so presumably
                            this matter is resolved.) Reportedly, Gen. <persName corresp="#p_SGDM1">Shoup</persName> said if the senior <pb n="345" xml:id="pg_345" facs="0365"/>Air Force officers in Saigon were not man enough to

                        </list>
                        <p>1. I talked with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FLMV1">Forrestal</persName> on
                            the several factors involved in the question of employing chemicals for
                            crop destruction.</p>
                        <p>2. The essential element in his view is a desire for assurances that the
                            potential gain will be worth the possible adverse propaganda and
                            political results. He sees particular sensitivity in US association with
                            action that decreases food supply in a generally food-short continent
                            such as Asia. He is not convinced the intelligence that is available
                            will provide more than a few clear-cut cases in which crop destruction
                            might serve its purpose. He feels these limited gains would not offset
                            the other disadvantages. On the other hand, if the target survey
                            indicated a significant potential gain against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> he would tend to give the political
                            disadvantages less weight. He distinguishes between Communist propaganda
                            on recent defoliation and that which would follow crop destruction.</p>
                        <p>3. On this basis, I sense he would not object to telling Saigon to go
                            ahead with a joint study of possible targets, but will resist any
                            suggestion that the Embassy be authorized to give a go ahead for crop
                            destruction on the basis of such a survey without Washington once again
                            considering the issue.</p>
                        <p>4. Since writing the above, I understand the new State/Defense draft
                            calls for a review in Saigon of crop destruction tests previously
                            conducted in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>;<note n="2" xml:id="d170fn2">See <ref target="#d174">Document 174</ref>.</note>
                            if on review, the <gloss target="#t_Amb1">Amb</gloss> and Gen <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> are <pb n="346" xml:id="pg_346" facs="0366"/>convinced these tests indicate
                            effectiveness, a combined target survey with <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> is authorized; on completion of the survey, Washington
                            will then consider any recommendations for crop destruction operations
                            and advise Saigon accordingly. This looks like the best action we can
                            get and, in my mind, is sound if undertaken expeditiously.</p>

                        <p>1. I discussed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AJM4">Anspacher</persName>
                            his detailed views on the situation in South Viet-Nam and the role the
                            US should play at an advisory level to control future events.</p>
                        <p>2. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AJM4">Anspacher</persName> has prepared an
                            informal paper,<note n="2" xml:id="d171fn2">Not found.</note> predicated
                            on the premise that the US is committed to success in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, which cites the primary need as a
                            projection of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> influence into the
                            provinces and villages to motivate the people and develop a viable
                            national entity. In developing his thesis, he understandably lays
                            particular stress on the requirements for better public information,
                            public relations, and general identification of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> with the populace. He carefully notes,
                            however, the related economic, political, and security measures which
                            must go hand in hand. This is of course a generally accepted idea; I
                            attempted, first, to draw out the details which he foresaw for
                            implementation and; second, to determine the role the US should assume
                            to make the effort successful.</p>
                        <p>3. In the first instance, he has developed general conceptual support
                            which involves “citizens committees,” Army civic action, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> reforms, and discreet propaganda. He
                            has not prepared a detailed plan and indicates that sort of approach,
                            with specific objectives, is not yet being followed by our Embassy in
                            Saigon. As I understand it, the Embassy is concentrating on “plugging
                            holes in the dike” rather than trying to build an administrative
                            framework to do a clearly defined job. In summary, <persName corresp="#p_AJM4">Anspacher</persName> feels there is a need for
                            such a plan of action on the US side which can then be translated into
                            an acceptable form for discussion with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. (Two recent examples of minimum response from Saigon
                            involved a civic action plan and a proposal for rural medical teams. In
                            the former, the Saigon reply to Washington <pb n="348" xml:id="pg_348" facs="0368"/>said no plan could be formulated because the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> had not decided on the relative
                            priority of areas; if the Embassy had their own concept and plan a
                            little push, this sort of problem could be solved quickly. In the case
                            of the medical teams, no reply has been received. Both actions were
                            suggested from Washington over 4 weeks ago.)</p>
                        <p>4. On the second point, <persName corresp="#p_AJM4">Anspacher</persName>
                            is convinced the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will not gain
                            requisite identity with the rural populace unless there is an
                            enlightenment which cannot now be foreseen. He feels, without specifying
                            a time limit, that we will have to present to <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> certain minimum actions which must
                            be taken to win the war. He stresses that the growing military
                            capability will, in the last analysis, be unable to do the job
                            regardless of the numbers of Viet Cong who are killed. He is not wholly
                            pessimistic on the results of an approach to Diem, but recognizes that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s concern with his power
                            position and <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>'s negative influence offer little
                            encouragement unless our proposals are made in a concise, clear, and
                            forceful way. Because of the possibility that <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> could not be swayed to the extent
                            required, <persName corresp="#p_AJM4">Anspacher</persName> advocates
                            preparation now for the alternative of a unilateral US effort to gain
                            rural loyalty for the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. (The province
                            surveys which, aside from the information value, put the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in the villages, is [sic] dormant
                            because the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is not making personnel
                            available and desire to phase the surveys with the pacification
                            strategy. The Embassy concurs with this approach and sees no advantage
                            in pushing the issue. Again, without a plan of action of their own, the
                            Embassy sees no value in getting into a maximum number of provinces
                            quickly so that follow-up measures can be formulated and a campaign to
                            reach the people can be pursued vigorously.)</p>
                        <p>5. He has not developed this alternative in any detail. He foresees
                            exploitation of American influence and presence in the countryside
                            through US provincial military advisors, US military advisors in <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> down to battalion level, proposed
                                <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> substations in the
                            countryside, the capability of the United States to build up a specially
                            configured group of aircraft to improve <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> official contact in the countryside, … .He thinks that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> would be powerless to
                            stop, and perhaps would not desire to stop, such a program. (<persName corresp="#p_AJM4">Anspacher</persName> strongly supports the idea of
                            an airlift for civil purposes; he concurs that it would be very useful.
                            The Embassy has not requested such action; and the suggestion made in
                            the Special Group (<gloss target="#t_CI1">CI</gloss>) weeks ago on this
                            subject has produced no State reaction.)</p>
                        <p>6. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AJM4">Anspacher</persName>'s recommendations
                            suggest that a judgment must be made soon as to whether there is a need
                            for greater <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> responsiveness to US
                            advice and whether such receptivity will be achieved if the present
                            situation and relations continue. There is increasing attention to this
                            matter, but on the whole, we continue to be hopeful that the wide range
                            of supporting actions being taken on our <pb n="349" xml:id="pg_349" facs="0369"/>side will ultimately have some effect. While the two
                            situations are not exactly parallel, this is the same mode of thinking
                            which characterized the French effort in the early 1950's.</p>
                        <p>7. It seems to me there continues to be a need for harder thinking on the
                            various actions we would like to see taken in South Viet-Nam including
                            those designed to gain the loyalty of the people. It is not sufficient
                            to point to the <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName>
                            Pacification Strategy as the solution of all ills, particularly since
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> has not yet defined the
                            strategy as he sees it in terms of detailed implementing action. As we
                            reach a consensus here (or in Saigon) as to what is required in detail,
                            we can then assess the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> position and
                            capabilities relative to it. Until such a plan is developed, it will be
                            impossible to gauge progress until very late in the game.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy has just forwarded an outline plan for counterinsurgency
                                operations<note n="3" xml:id="d171fn3">
                                <ref target="#d11">Document 11</ref>.</note> which is used as a
                            guide on the US side in Saigon. It is a sound paper stressing concept,
                            but falls short of providing a means by which action required can be
                            determined and pursued. The plan is attached and two sections (concept
                            and Political/Economic/Psychological Operations) are marked; if you scan
                            these parts you will have a sense of what is contained in the overall
                            plan.</p>
                        <p>8. You may desire to suggest to the Special Group (<gloss target="#t_CI1">CI</gloss>) that the TF be asked to use this Plan as a take-off
                            point in developing specific courses of action required to support it
                            and any enlargement of the concept that looks desirable here. The
                            results could ultimately be sent to Saigon for comment leading to a
                            paper that could be used for discussion with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in whole or detail.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>1. On April 3 you requested me to “take a new hard look and come up with
                            recommendations” on how we might obtain military assistance to Viet-Nam
                            from other governments.<note n="2" xml:id="d172fn2">See <ref target="#d138">Document 138</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Since April 3 I have submitted this problem to the Task Force/
                            Viet-Nam, visited Viet-Nam with General LeMay, consulted with Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName>, Chargé d'Affaires
                                <persName corresp="#p_TWC2">Trueheart</persName>, and Secretary of
                            State <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>. I have also
                            discussed the problem in very general terms with <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">R.G.K. Thompson</persName> and First Secretary
                            Denson of the British Embassy. Following is my report:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">General Considerations</p>
                        <p>1. As Dr. Rostow has said, psychologically it would be of benefit in our
                            international relations if other nations in the area were cooperating
                            with us militarily in Viet-Nam as a visible demonstration of solidarity
                            against Communist attack.</p>
                        <p>2. Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said
                            he favored the idea if it were worked out on a “token” basis (<persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s approval would be needed at some
                            point).</p>
                        <p>3. It should be anticipated that:</p>
                        <p>a) The <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> would probably be most
                            unhappy. The Canadians and Indians would probably complain to us. The
                                <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> would probably cite</p>
                        <p>b) Those nations favoring a “Geneva type” conference or UN cognizance of
                            the problem would be likely to clamor that the war was broadening,
                            getting out of hand, and should be settled immediately by
                            conference.</p>
                        <p>c) As an initial reaction, the British would very likely disapprove
                            broadening the participation. They would require a “hard sell”. They
                            believe Viet-Nam should fight its war with the minimum necessary outside
                            help supplied as unobtrusively as possible to avoid “foreign flavor”.
                            This eases their problem as Co-Chairman of the Geneva Accords.)</p>
                        <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0371"/>
                        <p>d) Certain problems would be created for <gloss target="#t_USMACV1">USMACV</gloss> in integrating foreign training units or specialists
                            into the present military effort.</p>
                        <p>e) There is an outside chance that this “token” concept might later be
                            broadened to involve larger third country military contributions but
                            probably not to the extent of any substantial substitution of U.S.
                            personnel support.</p>
                        <p>f) There is no present planning that I am aware of to reduce the number
                            of U.S. military personnel in Viet-Nam. The course of the fight will
                            probably be the determining factor.</p>
                        <p>g) The disadvantages of having “foreigners” scattered through the
                            Viet-Nam forces at all fevers, plus the attendant risks of direct
                            confrontation with the Viet Cong are balanced by the demonstrated
                            military advantages of producing strikingly more efficient and effective
                            results from the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> in all
                            branches.</p>

                        <p>If it is determined, despite the anticipated disadvantages, to go forward
                            and seek a broad third country military participation, I recommend we do
                            it in the following sequence:</p>
                        <p>1. Consult the British, and possibly the French. A “hard sell” is likely
                            to be needed at a high level.</p>
                        <p>2. Have Ambassador Nolting discuss the concept with President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> and obtain concurrence.</p>
                        <p>3. After a meeting of the minds with the British and French, or a
                            determination to go forward anyway, then DOD/JCS could be directed to
                            ascertain (through <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> and
                            COMACV to dovetail the outside participation with the least
                            inconvenience) what local indigenous military units or military
                            specialists from each prospective country could best be employed. A half
                            dozen should be the minimum.</p>
                        <p>4. After receipt of the JCS survey, the Department of State could then
                            instruct each Embassy to make the appropriate exploration, seeking not
                            only a military contingent but also a strong political statement as
                            well.</p>
                        <p>5. After informal agreement, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            would make a formal request of each government for indicated support.
                            The replies could be widely advertised to the world, as in the case of
                            the <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> letters.<note n="4" xml:id="d172fn4">Next to this sentence were written the words: “They

                        </p>
                        <p>6. The above recommendations in no way detract from the present extensive
                            efforts now in progress to obtain third country economic, and social

                        </list>
                        <p>I recently spent two days in Dinh Tuong Province, three days in Kien
                            Tuong Province, and one day each in Long An, Kien Hoa and Binh Duong
                            Provinces. Most of the time was spent in the Province capitals talking
                            with officials and assorted folk, but I was also able to visit five
                            strategic hamlets and travel by road across the Plaine des Joncs from My
                            Tho to Moc Hoa (Kien Tuong).</p>
                        <p>Based on these visits, my estimate is that the war effort in the
                            provinces is often confused, but that the energy now being applied by
                            ourselves and the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> can result in
                            substantial improvement in the security situation within a year or two.
                            Success will depend in large measure on continued emphasis on the
                            strategic hamlet concept. If the steam goes out of this effort after a
                            few months, much momentum will be lost and I doubt that a better concept
                            can be developed in any event.</p>
                        <p>Success also depends on the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>'s
                            reaction. If they step up infiltration sharply to meet the strategic
                            hamlet program, progress may be much slower. Fortunately there is a
                            limit to which they can reinforce the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            without opening themselves up to conventional attacks. Their great
                            advantage now is the guerrilla character of the war, and this would
                            likely be changed by an infusion of large numbers of infiltrators</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Vietnamese-American Relations</p>
                        <p>American advisors have not been accepted with open arms by all provincial
                            officials by any means. In particular the sector advisors (advisors to
                            the Chiefs of Province) have been met with considerable reserve. In only
                            one of the provinces visited did the sector advisor have his office
                            physically located in the same building with the Chief of Province. The
                            Chief of Dinh Tuong Province refused such an arrangement by telling his
                            advisor that the President would not want him to have an American
                            physically in his office building.</p>
                        <pb n="354" xml:id="pg_354" facs="0374"/>
                        <p>This reserve, which in some cases seems to amount to pretty deep
                            suspicion, is not unnatural. Rather large groups of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> officers—usually at least two or
                            three and often nine or ten—have suddenly appeared in all the province
                            capitals. According to the Chief of Kien Hoa Province, many if not most
                            provincial officials feel insecure in their jobs and cannot help fearing
                            that the American advisor will in some fashion or other cause them to be
                            replaced. Judging from some reporting I am aware of (which is also known
                            to the Vietnamese authorities), this is not always an unreasonable
                            fear.</p>
                        <p>This problem was expressed most frankly by Nguyen Thien Ke, the Surete
                            Chief in Dinh Tuong Province. Ke told me that suspicion of our motives
                            extends from the top down. According to Ke, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> at all levels believes we may decide at any time to
                            unseat <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>, and many Province
                            Chiefs are afraid of removal as a result of American pressures.</p>
                        <p>… … .</p>
                        <p> Ke went on to say that suspicion is not limited to the Americans. He
                            painted a rather grim picture of the in-fighting which he alleged goes
                            on within the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> bureaucracy. He summed
                            it up by two gestures, the traditional kowtow with palms pressed
                            together and head bent, and a motion as if firing a submachine gun at
                            the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. “I spend more time doing this”,
                            he said, making the kowtow gesture, “than this”,—he fired the invisible
                            gun—“and so do all officials who want to keep their jobs”.</p>
                        <p> Ke also noted that the Director of Economics for Dinh Tuong had called
                            him to tell him I was coming, and he had of course then felt obliged to
                            call the Chief of Province for advice on how to handle me. The Chief of
                            Province told him to be polite but reticent.</p>
                        <p> Colonel Thao expressed the same problem rather differently. According to
                            Thao, it is impossible for the United States to help Viet-Nam without
                            interfering in Vietnamese internal affairs. He insisted that our policy
                            must necessarily be one of support for the Free World and the Vietnamese
                            people, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> support for any individual leader.
                            Thao said coolly that if the time should come when it is clear that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> is not the best leader
                            available, then of course the U.S. will act to remove him, as we did in
                            Korea. The result is natural and unavoidable suspicion of us by the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>I replied simply that the U.S. is convinced <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> is the only leader who can save Viet-Nam, and that
                            I could not conceive of the situation being altered so radically that we
                            would feel another leader necessary. I added that we must remember who
                            we are; if we adopt a policy of authoritarian interference that amounts
                            to colonialism, we are little better than the Communists—in which case
                            why fight them? Our true interest is always the genuine independence of
                            our allies, not only vis-à-vis <pb n="355" xml:id="pg_355" facs="0375"/>the Communists but vis-à-vis the U.S. itself. We cannot use puppet
                            regimes to defend freedom. If the leadership of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is changed, it must be changed by the
                            Vietnamese people themselves.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question as to whether it would be useful to have a
                                <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> advisor-contact in the
                            province to expedite U.S. aid for the strategic hamlet program, the
                            Assistant Chief of Kien Hoa Province was enthusiastically affirmative.
                            But Thao said simply that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would
                            not permit it. It would be too direct an interference in Vietnamese
                            affairs to be tolerated at this time, according to Thao. He added that
                            the situation is not sufficiently desperate for such measures.</p>
                        <p>I believe time and patience will dissipate much of this suspicion. As the
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>s settle in, they will find
                            ways of approaching Vietnamese officials and gaining their confidence.
                            And the Vietnamese will get used to them. I would recommend the
                            following to minimize suspicion now and in the future:</p>
                        <p>(a) Issue a general directive that all officers and men and all civilian
                            personnel are to be informed regularly that they are not to criticize
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            <hi rend="italic">in front of Vietnamese at any time</hi>, particularly
                            in terms of the familiar charges of dictatorship and family rule. I am
                            convinced that many people are talking too loosely on these topics—other
                            officers in the Embassy have also heard this—and this feeds <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> suspicions. All of our people must know
                            that our effort here is weakened by such talk, that it is in short <hi rend="italic">subversive</hi>.</p>
                        <p>(b) Make a greater effort to brief Americans headed for the Provinces on
                            the importance of our stake here and on Vietnamese history and
                            character. Ignorance of these things can and has hurt our effort. Our
                            people must be motivated by the understanding that we are here to defend
                            the U.S. They must be equipped to deal with the Vietnamese with at least
                            a little knowledge of this strange land.</p>
                        <p>(c) Choose sector advisors with great care. I have met some very good
                            ones who have the necessary diplomatic virtues as well as military
                            competence. But their excellence is not universal.</p>
                        <p>(d) In the future make every effort to train people destined for duty in
                            the Provinces in the Vietnamese language. (In the Provinces, French is
                            of very little value, hardly better than English.) Real competence in
                            Vietnamese comes only after a year of full-time study and some months of
                            practice in the country, but some level of usefulness can be achieved in
                            less time. If there is any doubt of the importance of this
                            qualification, I suggest that the field be queried. I am sure that the
                            response will be unanimously and forcefully in favor of language
                            training. Time and again both Vietnamese and <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> officers expressed frustration to me because they
                            often could not communicate adequately with one another.</p>

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> is in many respects the key to
                            the whole problem because the defense of the strategic hamlets and most
                            of the posts in the countryside is in their hands. In the past they have
                            been ill equipped, <pb n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0376"/>ill trained
                            and ill paid. The <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>s in each
                            Province are rapidly doing something about the first two ills, and I
                            think we may look for a good return on this investment.</p>
                        <p>Virtually all provincial officials and most <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> officers seem to agree on the crucial importance and
                            the needs of the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>. Working together
                            on this program is therefore perhaps a little easier than is the case in
                            other areas. The chief complaint on the Vietnamese side seems to be that
                            the program is not moving fast enough. While this may have been the case
                            at one time, the program now seems very much on the rails. Large classes
                            are now in training (up to several hundred in some Provinces). While
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> officers on the spot are not
                            always entirely happy with the quality of the training, there seems to
                            be no doubt that this program will greatly improve the performance of
                            the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">(a) <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> Pay</p>
                        <p>The matter of <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> pay continues to worry
                            Provincial officials. The Assistant Chief of Kien Hoa Province went so
                            far as to point out that one of the reasons the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> are not more successful against the Communists is that
                            their low pay leads them to engage in petty theft—a chicken here, a pig
                            there—and the population is thus estranged from their defenders.</p>
                        <p>This view was expressed differently but with equal force by the Chief of
                            the Civil Guard for the 32nd Tactical Zone, a Captain Quan. Quan
                            observed that the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> get 30 piasters a
                            day while a day laborer can make 60. Quan went on to say that although
                            the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> are theoretically only part-time
                            soldiers and can thus supplement their income, the fact is that in a
                            wartime, indeed a siege situation, the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> is perforce a full-time occupation. Thus it isn't
                            surprising according to Quan that it is not always possible to recruit
                            good men for the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>A missionary in My Tho with nineteen churches in a half-dozen provinces
                            which he visits regularly by road in spite of the security situation
                            remarked that the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> is beginning to
                            behave itself pretty well vis-à-vis the local population (this was not
                            always true), and that the big problem now will be to keep the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> in hand. He agreed that an increase in
                            pay might help. Officials in other provinces expressed similar
                            views.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> fringe benefits are even less
                            attractive than the pay. I was told that there are no survivor benefits,
                            no disability benefits, and no retirement provisions. Perhaps more
                            serious is the almost total lack of medical care for the wounded. One
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> advisor told of visiting an
                            isolated <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> post where he found a man
                            who had been shot in a fire fight six months earlier. The wound had
                            healed, but the slug was still in the man and was causing him
                            considerable pain. The post had not been supplied for more than a month
                            when the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> advisor visited it and no
                            attempt had ever been made to treat the injured man.</p>
                        <pb n="357" xml:id="pg_357" facs="0377"/>
                        <p>I understand that <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> medical
                            facilities are open to the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> only on a
                            pay basis. Civilian facilities obviously cannot reach these isolated
                            posts—at least as they are now organized—and the upshot is that the
                                <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> are not getting much medical
                            care. (These isolated posts are not rare. <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> advisors tell me there are a great many small posts
                            which are supplied by armed convoy once every month or so. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> keep them in a constant state of sedge,
                            usually making no attempt to storm the post, but simply seeking to wear
                            down the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> inside by steady
                            harassment. Sometimes, but not often, all things considered, the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> surrender their weapons and run
                            away.)</p>
                        <p>Perhaps there is not much we can do about <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> pay, given the piaster shortage. But I think a hard
                            look at priorities may be in order on the question. The <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> are pretty important by all accounts in
                            the Provinces.</p>
                        <p>As for medical care, it looks as though something could be done to
                            alleviate if not solve the problem. A “fire brigade” medical team or two
                            might be organized from <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> or
                            civilian resources to fly to the scene of <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> actions, and <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>
                            medical facilities are probably not so overworked that they cannot
                            handle some of the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> casualties. And
                            our own military might be able to run in some medical units for the
                            purpose if all else fails.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">(c) [sic] Use of <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>
                        </p>
                        <p>There seems to be general agreement that the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> should garrison the strategic hamlets, where they will
                            serve as the backbone of the defense forces. Perhaps because of the rush
                            to get on with the strategic hamlet program, the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> seems often to be spread dangerously thin. The Civil
                            Guard Chief for the 32nd Tactical Zone told me plans call for only six
                            to twenty <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> in most of the strategic
                            hamlets planned for the five provinces in his jurisdiction. Some of the
                            so-called strategic hamlets I visited had only six to ten <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> to cover very large perimeters and
                            populations ranging up to 3,000. These <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> were generally not yet supported by youth groups, and
                            in any case I was told the youth groups are not going to be armed. If
                            adequate Civil Guard or <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> forces are
                            within call, perhaps such small garrisons would be adequate, but this is
                            not always the case by any means.</p>
                        <p>In the other direction, I understand that the famous Colonel Thao (who
                            has and wants no <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> in his
                            Province—but does sometimes call for <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> assistance) is in the habit of forming <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> into large units for province-wide
                            operations. And in Long An, as a matter of policy, the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> are often used in areas other than
                            those in which they were recruited. (According to the Chief of Province,
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> often volunteer for <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> duty. By shifting them to other areas
                            the authorities prevent these <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            volunteers from using their established contacts and <pb n="358" xml:id="pg_358" facs="0378"/>so they are “neutralized”. The loyal
                                <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> are of course also deprived of
                                <hi rend="italic">their</hi> local contacts, and their special
                            knowledge of their home area and its people is lost.)</p>
                        <p>No doubt it is good to be flexible, but perhaps that is expecting too
                            much for the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> when the other, more
                            elite fighting forces, are having some difficulty in adjusting to both
                            conventional and guerrilla styles. If the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>'s role were defined very narrowly in terms of defense
                            of the strategic hamlets from within, it might simplify training and
                            improve performance. This would mean leaving ambushes, sweeps, night
                            patrols outside the perimeter, population control and other more
                            sophisticated actions to forces such as the Civil Guard, the Surete and
                            the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>. And some rule-of-thumb for
                            the number of <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> required to defend a
                            given size perimeter against anticipated numbers of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> might also be useful to provincial
                            officials.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Strategic Hamlet Program</p>
                        <p>This effort occupies the center of the provincial stage, and if it
                            continues to be pursued energetically by both the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and us for a long period, I am
                            convinced it will pay off. At the moment, there are a great many
                            problems and misconceptions, and the short-range picture is not too
                            rosy. But we are moving in the right direction.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">(a) Chronic Shortages</p>
                        <p>The program suffers from shortages of all kinds. There are not enough
                                <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>, not enough barbed wire, not
                            enough cement, not enough weapons, not enough administrators, not enough
                            cadre, not enough piasters. Some of these shortfalls we can and should
                            remedy. I can think of no good reason why we cannot provide barbed wire,
                            cement, water pumps, simple medicaments, generators, bulldozers and the
                            like in adequate quantities if we decide that this program really must
                            have top priority in our aid effort. (I think it should. Long-range
                            economic development will be useless if our short-range effort
                            fails.)</p>
                        <p>Of the strategic hamlets I visited, only one—Ben Tuong in Binh Duong
                            Province—seemed to have plenty of material resources. Ben Tuong is
                            dearly intended to be a model strategic hamlet, and resources there have
                            been used lavishly. The perimeter was constructed by bulldozers, there
                            is a good double barbed wire fence with metal posts, there are two Civil
                            Guard companies inside the perimeter and two <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> companies outside plus a Psy War company. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has provided 18 tons of rice, 33 cadres
                            from Saigon and the Binh Duong province seat, a medical team including a
                            doctor, supplies of clothing and cloth, and reams of propaganda
                            materials.</p>
                        <pb n="359" xml:id="pg_359" facs="0379"/>
                        <p>More typical perhaps is Binh Hoa, a village of some 60 families a few
                            kilometers downstream from the Dinh Tuong provincial capital on the
                            Vaico River. Unlike the folk in Ben Tuong, most of whom were moved from
                            their old homes, the Binh Hoa villagers are staying right where they
                            have always been. Behind their homes facing the desolate plains country,
                            they are building a perimeter by hand labor. There will be no barrier on
                            the river side; evidently the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are not
                            expected from that direction. They are short of barbed wire and they
                            have only six <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>. All the labor and
                            virtually all of the resources used are coming from the village itself.
                            Binh Hoa is not going to be a model strategic hamlet.</p>
                        <p>The burden on the local populations is heavy. Every family in one area of
                            Dinh Tuong is required to make two kilos—about two hundred—spike traps
                            for their perimeter. This involves buying the nails required. In Kien
                            Hoa, the Surete Chief informed me that the new plastic identity cards
                            cost each citizen 50 piasters-ten piasters for the card and forty for
                            the strategic hamlet program (this in spite of the fact that Colonel
                            Thao is going slow, perhaps even dragging his feet on the program). I
                            believe the villages are generally buying their own barbed wire. (I was
                            told that in the 32nd Tactical Zone, all perimeter building is
                            accomplished by Community Development, which judging from my previous
                            experience I take to mean that all labor and all resources are provided
                            by the villages involved.) In all the villages I visited, local taxes
                            support local officials. The new hamlet administrators will be paid by
                            hamlet taxes.</p>
                        <p>Even in model Ben Tuong, the economic problem is serious for the people.
                            Several cadre working there told me that the most serious obstacle to
                            the success of the hamlet is the shortage of rice land that can be
                            cultivated with reasonable safety. So much of the arable land is subject
                            to <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> harassment that they fear the
                            village cannot support itself. This was echoed by a peasant who had come
                            to Ben Tuong voluntarily (a considerable number did not), who said he
                            was afraid his family would be hungry after the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> subsidy stopped. (It is only fair to add that the Chief

                            for cultivation, and that in any event the people can support themselves
                            by working on the nearby rubber plantation. These assurances have
                            evidently not been conveyed to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">(b) Sector Economic Advisors</p>
                        <p>One of the keys to the success of the refugee resettlement program in
                            this country was the use of American representatives of COMIGAL at
                            province and even village level. These men knew the situation first
                            hand, worked closely with local officials, and had authority <pb n="360" xml:id="pg_360" facs="0380"/>to call for and dispense aid items such
                            as cloth, roofing and rice (I have read some of their old records which
                            the Consulate at Hue inherited at my request).</p>
                        <p>Later we got into the position of being able to dispense aid only through
                            appropriate ministries, and <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> pulled
                            all of its “field representatives” out of the provinces. Vietnamese
                            officials at the province level have been complaining of the
                            slowness—and sometimes the inappropriateness—of U.S. aid ever since.
                            They mentioned it frequently to me on this trip when I asked what we
                            could do to help.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that if we mean business on the strategic hamlets, we
                            should reestablish the old system of direct contact and direct aid as
                            much as possible. If the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will not
                            formally accept Sector Economic Advisors—and I think it is certainly
                            worth a pitch in spite of what Thao says—perhaps we could somehow put an
                            economic advisor on the provincial <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
                            staffs. (One of the very best <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
                            senior advisors complained because there is no such person on his staff
                            or in his area.)</p>
                        <p>To be useful, a Sector Economic Advisor would have to have considerable
                            discretion in the use of funds and American supplied equipment. He would
                            have to be able to make sure that the strategic hamlets get the barbed
                            wire, water pumps, generators, etc., that they need <hi rend="italic">in

                            vigorously to the program (the Long An Province Chief told me he has
                            “lost” three strategic hamlets already, Ben Tuong is being harassed
                            continually according to officials there, and in Dinh Tuong the VC
                            reportedly went so far as to dig a three kilometer long tunnel in an
                            attempt to get through the perimeter defenses of a strategic hamlet
                            there). I think there is real danger that too many strategic hamlets
                            will be knocked over by the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and the
                            whole concept discredited in the eyes of the people and the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> administrators because of a failure to
                            provide adequate resources rapidly.</p>

                            Provinces</p>
                        <p>As I noted in my previous memo, the <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> concept of the strategic hamlet is often not
                            completely understood in the provinces. The provincial effort now puts
                            less stress on patrols outside the perimeter and communications with
                            reserve forces than I would hope for. The provincial concept in fact
                            often is really only an extension of the static defense approach which
                            has dotted the countryside with Beau Geste towers. I think <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> can do a lot to set this straight as
                            time goes on.</p>
                        <p>In talks with provincial officials I stressed what I conceive to be the
                            four major requirements for a strategic hamlet: (1) a perimeter and an
                                <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> force adequate to meet the usual
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> threat in that area; (2)
                            communications with provincial and <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>
                            reserve forces in case of <pb n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0381"/>attack; (3) constant Civil Guard or <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> patrols, particularly at night, outside the
                            perimeters; (4) an adequate economic and social base for the village in
                            terms of safe rice growing areas, social services such as schools and
                            medicines, and better administration.</p>
                        <p>A rather notable heretic is Colonel Thao. He talks in terms of bases
                            among the people, insists that perimeters are not only unnecessary but
                            make the people feel they are in prison. He observed that Saigon has
                            accused him of not implementing the program, but he claims this is not
                            true; he is only going slow and sure. Judging from what he said and what
                            his people showed me, he is mostly going Thao. In spite of his great
                            abilities and his theory that the basic solution is <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> respect for the people, I think he is
                            out in left field on this one. And it is a pretty crucial issue.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">(d) Salaries</p>
                        <p>One of the thornier problems facing us is how to pay strategic hamlet
                            officials and youth defenders. I noted above the problem with regard to
                            the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>. It applies with equal force to
                            the new strategic hamlet administrations.</p>
                        <p>According to the Chief of Dinh Tuong Province, pay for hamlet chiefs will
                            be the same as that for the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>—900
                            piasters a month. His Civic Action Chief said, however, that most of the
                            hamlets have no money to pay their officials, and consequently they have
                            gone unpaid to date. He was more modest in his estimate of what they
                            should get, feeling that 500 or 600 piasters per month would suffice.
                            (According to this source, strategic hamlet administration will consist
                            of a hamlet chief and a four-man council, including council members
                            specifically charged with responsibility for youth, Surete, and finance.
                            In Long An, the Civic Action Chief stated that the pattern now is to set
                            up a temporary “building committee” composed of elders and other
                            prestigeful types to lend their authority to the actual construction of
                            the strategic hamlet. After the hamlet is set up, the people will select
                            a hamlet chief and a hamlet council.)</p>
                        <p>The problem does not even stop with <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>
                            and hamlet officials. Asked about his problems, the Chief of Binh Hiep
                            village in Kien Tuong Province observed that it is difficult to motivate
                            youth defenders for the strategic hamlets (not to be confused with the
                                <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>, which is expected to lead the
                            hamlet youth in case of attack). He suggested that pay of 400 or 500
                            piasters per month would create a much better situation. (He himself
                            gets 1,500 piasters per month from the village budget.) His thought, of
                            course, was that U.S. aid might provide this money. I did what I could
                            to explain the complexities of piaster generation, but I don't have much
                            confidence that he understood why it is so difficult for us to meet
                            piaster costs.</p>
                        <pb n="362" xml:id="pg_362" facs="0382"/>
                        <p>One of the more difficult salary problems is that of village health
                            workers. The head of the Dinh Tuong health service observed that he had
                            trained 138 village health workers for six months in his hospital, but
                            very few of them went to the villages when they finished their training.
                            They went to work for private physicians, set up “practices” of their
                            own or found unrelated work in the towns and cities because the villages
                            could not offer them a decent living.</p>
                        <p>He believes these workers should get 1,500 piasters a month, but they are
                            very lucky to get 900. He is now training health workers for the
                            strategic hamlets; in order to commit them to serve in the villages, he
                            will not give them a certificate until they set up shop in a strategic
                            hamlet or a village in the countryside. (In Long An, the health service
                            is training strategic hamlet health workers for fifteen days in the
                            local hospital. I doubt that they are very useful.)</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">(e) Cadre to Set Up the Hamlets</p>
                        <p>One of the brighter aspects of the program at the moment appears to be
                            the remarkable effort to send good cadre into the hamlets to get the
                            program into motion. In Ben Tuong strategic hamlet there were 33 men,
                            many of them from Saigon, all wearing black peasant garb, all evidently
                            quite intelligent and well motivated, and all committed to living a
                            peasant existence for an indefinite period. The fact that they had
                            received no pay from Saigon for some time did not seem to dampen their
                            enthusiasm. Even making allowances for the fact that Ben Tuong is
                            frequently visited by Americans and is obviously a model strategic
                            hamlet, this is pretty wonderful.</p>
                        <p>In Kien Tuong province, I attended the graduation ceremony for eighty
                            cadre who took a six week course to prepare them for working in the
                            strategic hamlets. These appeared to be Republican youths. I talked to
                            several of them afterward and was again impressed by the dedication of
                            these people. There is really a great deal of human material to work
                            with in the provinces if these groups are any example. (I might also add
                            in this connection the story of one man in an isolated post, three
                            quarters of which was overrun by the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>,
                            who determined that he would not be taken by the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. He rallied the other men in the post and fought off the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> from midnight to dawn. His wife
                            took over the weapon of one of the dead defenders and fought by his side
                            in best frontier style. They killed 32 <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. He showed me the decoration which the Chief of Province
                            gave him for this exploit.)</p>
                        <p>Virtually all of the Civic Action employees in the provinces are of
                            course up to their ears in the program. All Civic Action Chiefs visited
                            said they had organized courses for setting up strategic hamlets. (With
                            the combined staffs of the youth, information and old civic action
                            services, they command the largest group of cadre in the province, <pb n="363" xml:id="pg_363" facs="0383"/>often more than 100 personnel.)
                            Several of them are also putting out very commendable weekly and even
                            daily provincial newspapers with circulations of several thousand.</p>
                        <p>The picture here is not entirely rosy, of course. In a strategic hamlet
                            in Long An, I ran into a “delegation” of several cadre out of Saigon
                            “inspecting” the hamlet. They were all more or less drunk and
                            patronizing the villagers in a rather unhappy fashion. But I think this
                            behavior is exceptional.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>On this trip as on the last one, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
                            advisors told me that <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> troops
                            sometimes show little enthusiasm for engaging the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. This is often connected with the use of helicopters;
                            the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> forces climb out of the
                            helicopters and instead of immediately moving forward to engage the
                            fleeing <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, wait for all units to arrive
                            so that they can form themselves into battalions. The <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> advisors are doing all they can to
                            overcome these problems and feel they are making some headway, but the
                            going is slow.</p>
                        <p>The Rangers are the bright spot here. They are always ready and more than
                            willing to fight <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. One <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> advisor suggested that Ranger and
                            helicopter companies ought to be “married” so that they could get the
                            helicopters quickly when they need them without the delay of Saigon red
                            tape. (I was told Province Chiefs cannot use helicopters for their
                            operations, so the Rangers do not often get helicopters. This is
                            evidently a Vietnamese decision and reflects the continuing problem of
                            coordination and jealousy between the regular military and the Province
                            Chiefs with their direct lines to <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>.)</p>

                        <p>Here in Saigon, as far as I can make out, morale has definitely improved
                            as a direct result of our efforts. In the provinces, officials at least
                            are bullish, feeling that the people are not only getting fed up with
                            Red terror but see an “out” in the strategic hamlets. An American
                            missionary in My Tho gave considerable support to this reading of
                            popular feelings, added that the improved <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>, our helicopters, and greater delegation of authority
                            to field commanders have pushed the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            out of many areas where they formerly worked openly. He now travels on
                            many roads that were closed in December, and feels we are on the crest
                            of a small wave that could grow rapidly if the strategic hamlet program
                            is pushed hard and consistently for another year or two.</p>

                        <p>1. Primary consideration of any crop destruction program is to be sure it
                            will not result in US and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> absorbing
                            adverse propaganda criticism and adverse local reaction without
                            achieving any commensurate military advantage.</p>
                        <p>2. This suggests first step should be careful evaluation of whether
                            available chemicals and techniques will in fact produce satisfactory
                            destruction of crop targets. Do not desire approve release of chemicals
                            to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> until this is determined. Results
                            of the few crop destruction experiments reported to ARPA not conclusive.
                            Therefore as first step <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss>
                            should review all Combat Test and Development Center results their
                            experiments. Also suggest you obtain opinion of expert group headed by
                            General Delmore which is now in Saigon to evaluate defoliation and crop
                            desiccation. Request you report essence their findings. Task Force
                            Saigon should then discuss and review results, reach decision as to
                            employment, and advise Department.</p>

                        <p>3. If more experimentation is necessary then time should be allowed for
                            this before further steps are taken towards crop destruction program.
                            Appropriate measures should be taken so that unfavorable publicity does

                        <p>Dear Ed: Sorry not to have answered your letter of April 17<note n="2" xml:id="d175fn2">
                                <ref target="#d161">Document 161</ref>.</note> earlier.</p>
                        <p>Your letter raises two questions:</p>
                        <p>1. What is our position on the reunification of Viet-Nam?</p>
                        <p>It remains as stated by Bedell Smith. Under present circumstances,
                            however, with war in the country, our immediate objective is the
                            restoration of peace and of the situation created by the Geneva
                            Agreement of 1954.</p>
                        <p>2. What would be our aims in the event we became engaged in military
                            operations against North Viet-Nam?</p>
                        <p>The political objective of any military plan involving North Viet-Nam
                            would be the restoration of the situation created by the Geneva
                            Agreement of 1954—the division of Viet-Nam at the 17th parallel
                            guaranteed by the powers. There is no thought at present of a
                            re-conquest of North Viet-Nam by military means, to effect a
                            reunification.</p>
                        <p>The only thinking which comes close to your question which I have heard
                            is the proposition (no official sanction yet) that if our present
                            efforts in Viet-Nam fail, we should go to the source of the problem and
                            apply graduated punishment on the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to
                            cease and desist. This does not involve reunification, however.</p>
                        <pb n="366" xml:id="pg_366" facs="0386"/>
                        <p>So, my conclusion is that however meritorious it might be to seek
                            reunification through military force, I know of no such policy.
                            Consequently, if the Admiral wants to make his assumptions match present
                            thinking rather than break new ground, I think he would be safer to use
                            the “graduated punishment” idea.</p>
                        <p>If, however, he postulates overt Chicom intervention, with a scrap
                            between us and the Chinese, then my own idea is that if we had to
                            destroy both the Chinese and <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> war
                            making capability it would be rather silly to return the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to Commie control.</p>
                        <p>This is the best I can do on Monday morning.</p>
                        <p>All the best,</p>
                        <p>Sincerely,</p>

                            <item>2. I was asked to report on how we were doing in South Viet-Nam,
                                and spoke from the <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> talking

                                that purpose. At the end of it, the President raised the question of
                                defoliants saying that he was inclined to think they were not very
                                useful. I said that ambushes are better and more frequently laid
                                under cover of terrain than foliage, but that our problem was going
                                to be with President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> who
                                seemed to be enamored with the idea of using defoliants against
                                crops.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> said that he
                            thought there was a great deal of merit in the idea of using defoliants
                            on crops. I argued that the use of defoliants against crops at the
                            present stage of the war would not be very helpful since the Viet Cong
                            still have access to non-communist villages until the strategic village
                            plan had been implemented.</p>
                        <p>I also argued that there would be a stage in the war when the major rice
                            growing areas were held by the government. At that time, the Viet Cong
                            might have small paddy fields in remote mountain valleys and it might
                            well be desirable to attack these fields. But I thought napalm would be
                            just as efficient as defoliants, since only two or three fields would be
                            involved in any one operation.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> argued that
                            there was no difference between napalm and defoliants. I disputed this,
                            saying that defoliants were open to germ warfare charges, and that the
                            villagers were receptive because of the propaganda campaign during the
                            Korean War. The President agreed with the latter argument.</p>
                        <p>It was then noted that an additional experiment with defoliants on 7

                        <p>I have just read <persName corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName>'s report
                            to Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> on the
                            possibility of obtaining military assistance from other countries in
                                Vietnam.<note n="2" xml:id="d177fn2">
                                <ref target="#d172">Document 172</ref>.</note> I must say that the
                            report is giving me some serious second thoughts about the concept.</p>
                        <p>What is the objective that we seek to achieve? Three can be identified:
                            (a) a reduced need for U.S. forces in Vietnam; (b) a useful political
                            effect in the U.S. through creation of an impression that we are not
                            “fighting the war alone”; and (c) an increased awareness and
                            understanding on the part of other countries in the area of the
                            situation in Vietnam. I have never been sanguine about the possibility
                            that we could really reduce the requirements for American forces. The
                                <persName corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName> report confirms my
                            doubts.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the third objective, the <persName corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName> report makes clear what was probably already
                            evident-that we can expect help only from some of our <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> allies plus Korea and Nationalist
                            China. These countries are already convinced on the subject of Vietnam.
                            Their participation will add little or nothing to their understanding
                            and may even be somewhat discouraging as they come into contact with the
                            defects of <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s method of
                            operation.</p>
                        <p>This leaves us with the second objective. It is possible that third
                            country participation will have some useful political effects in the
                            U.S. and I understand that this may be the principal reason why Governor
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> is interested in
                            pursuing the matter further.</p>
                        <p>This advantage must, however, be weighed against the international
                            political disadvantages of third country participation. If such
                            participation would, as the Cottrell paper suggests, really make the
                                <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> more likely to cite the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> for violation of the Geneva accords or
                            if it significantly increased pressures for a Geneva-type conference on
                            Vietnam, it would seem to me that the disadvantages would outweigh the
                            advantage.</p>
                        <p>I have suggested to <persName corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName> that
                            the U.S. political purpose might not be almost as well served and the
                            international political disadvantages reduced if we sought military
                            personnel exclusively for “constructive non-belligerent” functions. For
                            example, we might make a <pb n="369" xml:id="pg_369" facs="0389"/>request for military medical personnel. We also might seek military
                            officers and non-commissioned officers who could assist in the
                            organization of engineering projects and rural public works. <persName corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName> seemed to think well of this
                            idea.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Vietnam</p>
                        <p>So far as I can discover, there is no significant change in the general
                            situation in Vietnam. There is an immediate problem over the border
                            incident with Cambodia,<note n="2" xml:id="d178fn2">Presumably a
                                reference to an incident in which a band of armed Cambodians crossed
                                the border into Vietnam and killed several civilians, reported in
                                telegram 1336 from Saigon, April 23. (Department of State, Central
                                Files, 651H.51K/4-2362)</note> but the feeling of the State
                            Department seems to be that the situation remains potentially
                            hopeful.</p>
                        <p>There is some concern that Operation Sunrise may be running into
                            difficulties which were anticipated, i.e. since it has been undertaken
                            in one of the more difficult areas, the forced resettlement is causing
                            some defections among the villagers to the Viet Cong. Other programs for
                            strengthening village defenses and pacifying selected areas are,
                            however, proceeding satisfactorily.</p>
                        <p>The dual questions of defoliation and crop destruction have come up
                            again. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s
                            research group has indicated that defoliation is technically feasible if
                            greater quantities of defoliant are sprayed per acre. A roadside
                            experiment of a 7-kilometre stretch is being conducted, not only to
                            prove out technical effectiveness, but also to determine whether
                            defoliation will deter roadside ambushes.<note n="3" xml:id="d178fn3">In
                                the margin next to this and the preceding paragraph the word “no”
                                was written twice. Also in the margin was the statement: “I didn't
                                mention this to Reynolds.” Reynolds has not been identified.</note>

                        <p>On the question of crop destruction, your staff has indicated to the
                            State and Defense Departments that they should not come up with a
                            request for your approval to turn the chemicals over to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> until a thorough discussion of all of
                            the factors can be assembled, including:</p>
                        <p>(1) scientific assurance based upon extensive testing that the herbicides
                            are completely effective:</p>
                        <p>(2) a selection of targets based upon sound intelligence, which would
                            justify the conclusion that crop destruction will produce sufficiently
                            valuable military results to justify the political cost.</p>
                        <p>In connection with (2) above, the question has arisen whether the
                            destruction of crops would not simply cause the Viet Cong to attack
                            loyal villages in order to gain a food supply at the time when these
                            villages were not yet fully capable of defending themselves. There is
                            also the problem of whether adequate arrangements can be made to assist
                            friendly Montagnards who live in the hill country with the Viet Cong and
                            whose crops would be affected.</p>
                        <p>No decision on crop destruction is required from you at this time.<note n="4" xml:id="d178fn4">A memorandum for the record by Forrestal, May
                                2, supplies the only record of the meeting. With regard to Vietnam,
                                three decisions were made:</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>“3. The President asked that an effort be made to screen visitors to
                            South Vietnam in order to limit any unnecessary trips there, especially
                            by high ranking officers.</p>
                        <p>“4. The President directed that the recent authorization for an
                            operational experiment with defoliation on 7 kilometers of road in
                            Vietnam be rescinded. Such an experiment would better be conducted in
                            Thailand.</p>
                        <p>“5. The President agreed that we should await the report of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> in Vietnam before considering indirect
                            approaches to Hanoi on the Vietnam conflict.” (Kennedy Library, National

                            need for introductions. Then he turned the meeting over to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJ10">Mecklin</persName> who said he would like to say a
                            few words he had prepared on the flight to Saigon from Paris.</p>
                        <p>He began by asking each member of the staff to prepare a memo of not over
                            two pages, based on the assumption that he, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJ10">Mecklin</persName>, did not know Vietnam, nor
                                <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> Saigon nor what the staff was
                            doing.</p>
                        <pb n="371" xml:id="pg_371" facs="0391"/>
                        <p>He asked that he be told exactly what each staff member does, what his
                            problems are and what complaints he might have, and ideas of how we
                            might do things differently. When all of the memos are in, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJ10">Mecklin</persName> would have individual talks with
                            the staff to go over specifics.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJ10">Mecklin</persName> said that in his three
                            weeks in Washington he was much impressed with what we are doing here.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AJM4">Anspacher</persName>'s debriefing,
                            significantly, was attended by 85 people. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AJM4">Anspacher</persName>, he said, spoke decisively
                            and fervently of Vietnam and its problems with particular reference to
                                <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>'s role. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AJM4">Anspacher</persName> was a hard man to succeed
                            because of his excellent performance here. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJ10">Mecklin</persName> spoke briefly about his own
                            background, noting that he had spent three years here during and after
                            Dien Bien Phu. He said he had a high regard for President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s performance at that time in an
                            extraordinarily difficult situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJ10">Mecklin</persName> has been with <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> for only eight months and he asked
                            the staff for forbearance and patience. He said the <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> job here is particularly important
                            because half the struggle in Vietnam is psychological and that, of
                            course, is our field. There should be no doubt that the Communists in
                            Vietnam are going to be defeated. What counts is to get done what needs
                            to be done and it isn't important who does it. There must be no
                            back-biting among elements of the U.S. Mission.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJ10">Mecklin</persName> said he would welcome
                            advice and that there is urgent need to generate ideas. He said that one
                            of our most important targets is the illiterate peasant in the bush, for
                            example. We need every available bit of information on whether our
                            product is reaching these people and every available idea on how to
                            improve the effort. We need to be sure somebody is listening.</p>
                        <p>While in Washington, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJ10">Mecklin</persName>
                            met Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Robert Thompson</persName> of the
                            British Mission to Vietnam, who suggested that there should be a new
                            name for the Viet Cong, eliminating the term “Viet”. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJ10">Mecklin</persName> said he would initiate a contest
                            among the <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> local staff, offering a
                            prize of $50.00, to coin a new phrase which would describe the
                            Communists as foreign puppets, or something of that sort, to make them
                            lose face.</p>
                        <p>Re American policy in Vietnam: a Communist victory here is unacceptable.
                            This is the determined, hard thinking of our government. The U.S. will
                            give Vietnam all possible help short of combat troops. Our mission, in
                            cooperation with other U.S. agencies, is to persuade the man who has
                            been given a rifle to stand up and use it. Confidence, both ways, is
                            thus of vital importance.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJ10">Mecklin</persName> then made what he
                            termed a “pronouncement”: in this <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>
                            post, there is complete freedom of speech. Comment and criticism are
                            encouraged. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJ10">Mecklin</persName>'s door is
                            open to any staff member at any time. But this kind of talk must be
                            confined to the family. It <pb n="372" xml:id="pg_372" facs="0392"/>is
                            of paramount importance that Vietnamese confidence in the U.S. and in
                            their own efforts be restored and expanded. “Doom-saying” outside the
                            family is intolerable.</p>
                        <p>As for the foreign press: it is a difficult situation, especially in view
                            of the “official” presence of only 685 Americans in all of Vietnam.
                            Telegram 1006<note n="2" xml:id="d179fn2">
                                <ref target="#d75">Document 75</ref>.</note> is still our guidance
                            and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJ10">Mecklin</persName> thought we could
                            live with it. This post's policy is: (1) what is said to the press is
                            the responsibility of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>; (2) USIS officers are free to talk with the
                            press at any time, but as far as possible, within the framework of the
                            Ambassador's guidance relayed by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJ10">Mecklin</persName>. We must try to avoid stories that attribute
                            undesirable comment or embarrassing fact to “American sources”, since
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is sensitive to this sort of
                            thing, (3) it is equally important to recognize that a free press is a
                            part of the fundamental fabric of the American way of life, and the rule
                            is therefore to level with American newsmen as far as possible, and
                            never engage in deception. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJ10">Mecklin</persName> added that deception doesn't pay, anyway.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJ10">Mecklin</persName> reminded every
                            one that <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> has a supporting role to
                            play. The less said about <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>-Saigon
                            in the press or anywhere else, the better are the chances of
                            success.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName> stated that he has
                            returned from his recent trip to South Viet-Nam with three general
                            impressions:</p>
                        <p>A. In the strategic hamlet concept, together with a quick military
                            reaction, we have found the right formula.</p>
                        <p>B. More confusion exists in the inter-relationship between U.S. advisers
                            and Viet-Nam opposite numbers in military units than he had previously
                            thought. This applies to the reporting of aircraft, as well as the
                            linking of communications.</p>
                        <p>C. The fiscal problem has again become serious. The South Viet-Nam budget
                            exceeds the country's income plus U.S. aid.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName> summed up the
                            situation by stating that in his opinion we have reached bottom in South
                            Viet-Nam, and that he is not sure whether we have made the upturn yet.
                            Evidence as to an upturn will include such things as the number of Viet
                            Cong attacks, the number of Viet Cong personnel killed, and the South
                            Viet-Nam military reaction time.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> expressed the
                            Group's interest in receiving the views of the Secretary of Defense
                            following his return from South Viet-Nam. General <persName corresp="#p_DGH1">Decker</persName> will disseminate to the Group a

                        </list>
                        <p>1. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName> advises me that
                            the question of the desirability and extent of foreign military
                            participation in the fight in South Viet-Nam has been carefully reviewed
                            by State in the last few days. A decision <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0394"/>has been made to pass on each case that comes up rather
                            than attempt to organize any sort of multi-national contribution from
                            the Washington end.</p>
                        <p>2. The first specific case is Korea. As you will see from the attached
                                telegram,<note n="2" xml:id="d181fn2">Reference is to telegram 1135
                                from Seoul, April 28, not found attached. (Department of State,
                                Central Files, 751K.5811/4-2862)</note> received during your
                            absence, the Koreans have advised the United States officially of their
                            plan to despatch a military mission to Saigon. This is the same project
                            of which we had earlier word through intelligence channels.</p>
                        <p>3. State has worked up a draft reply to the Ambassador in Seoul which, in
                            effect, indicates the US has no objection to the Korean mission but
                            expresses the desirability of coordinating the Group's work with General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> on arrival in
                            Saigon.</p>
                        <p>The decision is subject to concurrence of our Ambassadors in Seoul and
                            Saigon and the outgoing telegram is so worded.<note n="3" xml:id="d181fn3">

                        <p>You will note in paragraph 2 of the Seoul telegram that the mission
                            includes experts in intelligence organization and operations; otherwise,
                            the functional composition of the Korean group appears to be useful, can
                            probably be absorbed without military complications, and will achieve
                            the political objectives.</p>
                        <p>4. State is consulting with Defense this afternoon to gain their
                            clearance on the draft telegram. Barring complications, an answer should
                            be sent by Saturday.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_PG1">Parthasarathi</persName> came in at my
                            invitation for long and I think important talk about South Vietnam. He
                            confirmed confidentially what we had heard from Canadians about the
                            report, hopes to have it by first of June.<note n="2" xml:id="d183fn2">See <ref target="#d208">Document 208</ref>.</note> It will condemn

                        <p>I pressed <persName corresp="#p_PG1">Parthasarathi</persName> at length
                            on his discussions in Hanoi. He stressed what we have heard before,
                            to-wit, that there is a difference between moderates who would like to
                            forestall Chinese intervention and a radical pro-Chinese fraction. He
                            doubts that there is any fear of American attack on North Vietnam but
                            there is a widespread conviction that we aim to entrench ourselves
                            militarily in the South. He states also that the Russians have told
                            Hanoi that we are not very comfortable in our situation in the South,
                            that we do not see how we can win with <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> but equally do not see any alternatives.</p>
                        <pb n="376" xml:id="pg_376" facs="0396"/>
                        <p>Turning to the South, Parthasarathi believes <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s political base is continuing to shrink, that the
                            strategic villages plan, however plausible from a military point of
                            view, is politically disastrous and based on false analogy by <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> and others to Malayan
                            situation. He does not, however, see any immediate alternative to
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the prospects for settlement he shares your doubts about a
                            general conference. He does note that it would focus world attention on
                            area which would be a restraining factor. However he strongly hopes that
                            since both moderates in the North and Americans in the South find the
                            situation unsatisfactory, the way will be kept open for negotiation. The
                            right time he thinks is following the initial explosion which will
                            accompany the submission of the report to the co-chairman. When the
                            latter dies down he hopes the Co-chairman will ask for bilateral talks
                            on stabilization, compliance and peace. His suggestions are rather along
                            the line of our recent discussions in Washington, to-wit, if North calls
                            off the dogs for a stated period of months, we proclaim a standstill on
                            military personnel and equipment with further understanding that if
                            after say six months situation is stabilized we begin withdrawal.<note n="3" xml:id="d183fn3">Next to this sentence the word “wrong” is

                        </list>
                        <p>1. Task Force meeting today was mainly devoted to a verbal report from
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWG1">Stoneman</persName>, the <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> representative, on his observations
                            in a three week visit in Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>2. He was impressed with the operation of the intermediate level US
                            country team committee chartered to support, on the US side, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> province pacification operations. This
                            has served to focus US attention to the details of implementing action
                            in South Viet-Nam to an extent not previously attempted. For the first
                            time the country team is evaluating detailed supporting action that in
                            the past has been left to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. As a
                            result, the US is more actively prodding the various ministries in
                            Saigon for information and status of planning.</p>
                        <p>3. The initial results of this new US procedure has been a clearer
                            realization of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> disorganization and
                            ineffectiveness. There is no detailed <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> long-range planning for province pacification to
                            include logistic requirements and personnel needs. The requirements
                            deficiency is important because <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> has
                            only enough in-country resources to support two more province
                            operations. In order to generate necessary activities in the pipeline to
                            avoid future logistic delays, the US committee in Saigon is now trying
                            to work up their own estimates of material requirements based on what is
                            understood to be the proposed schedule for future operations. From this
                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> resources will be tapped.</p>
                        <p>4. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWG1">Stoneman</persName> was amazed at the
                            lack of firm planning in Saigon. Though he characterizes the US side as
                            energetic and willing, he stresses the limits of US influence due to the
                            lack of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> organization and <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s resistance to any suggested
                            streamlining. <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> recently asked
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> for authority to bypass
                            the Saigon ministries and deal directly with the province authorities to
                            support rural operations. <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>
                            said no.</p>
                        <p>5. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName> got the inference
                            from this presentation. He observed it is now obvious we are reaching a
                            crucial point at which it may be necessary to make a firm approach to
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> to insist on
                            administrative <pb n="378" xml:id="pg_378" facs="0398"/>procedures that
                            will get the job done. If action along these lines is not undertaken, it
                            is possible the large US investment will be of no avail.</p>
                        <p>6. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWG1">Stoneman</persName> also had a lengthy
                            discussion with the Minister of Civic Action. You will recall this
                            Ministry is also responsible for propaganda. <persName corresp="#p_SWG1">Stoneman</persName> says it is obvious the Minister considers the
                            civic action part of his task as of the lowest priority. He has no
                            rational conception of how his personnel are to be used or what type of
                            support they may need in the months ahead. He does not understand the
                            objectives of civic action and is approaching it on a very narrow
                            basis.</p>
                        <p>7. The importance of continuing <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            ineffectiveness to the war in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> is now

                        <p>On May 8-9, 1962, the ANZUS Council met in Canberra for the first time
                            since October 1959. United States representative Secretary of State
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> was joined by Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> and several others.
                            The Australian representative was Sir <persName corresp="#p_BSGEJ1">Garfield Barwick</persName>, Minister of External Affairs; New
                            Zealand was represented by Prime Minister and Minister of External
                            Affairs K.J. Holyoake. According to a summary of the conversation,
                            transmitted in airgram A-24 from Canberra, May 10, the Council undertook
                            a discussion of Laos and South Vietnam on the morning of May 9. The
                            discussion consisted of a briefing by Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> and exchanges between
                                <persName corresp="#p_BSGEJ1">Barwick</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> on the viability of the <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> regime, the extent of the United
                            States commitment in Vietnam, and me possibility of aid to South Vietnam
                            from Australia and New Zealand. Regarding the latter Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> offered to smooth the way for
                            aid from Australia and New Zealand when he visited Vietnam after the
                            ANZUS meeting. (Washington National Records Center, RG 84, Saigon

                        <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Averell</persName>: When I was back a
                            few weeks ago,<note n="2" xml:id="d186fn2">See <ref target="#d141fn1">footnote 1, Document 141</ref>.</note> the President asked me
                            if it would be a good idea for me to tell the representative of Hanoi
                            here that if they ever had any communications to you or to him to use me
                            as a channel. I told him I was a bit reluctant. The representative here
                            is a very low-level figure and it isn't at all easy for me to
                            communicate with him. Nor do I know of his reliability. We left the
                            matter at that but since no action was involved I never thought to
                            mention it to you.</p>
                        <p>The President, as you know, is anxious to have lines of communication
                            open against possible need. Yesterday when thinking about <persName corresp="#p_PG1">Parthasarathi</persName>'s forthcoming visit, it
                            occurred to me that he would be a good channel of communication.
                            Accordingly, without making much of a point of it, I told him that if he
                            ever felt Hanoi had anything to communicate to you or the President they
                            should feel free to do so and could do it through me. I doubt that
                            anything ever comes of this, but I thought you should know.</p>

                        <p rend="center">III. South Vietnam</p>
                        <p>1. As in Thailand, the period in South Vietnam was spent largely in
                            visits to military activities in the field. It included visits to the
                            Corps headquarters, to the scene of Operation Sunrise, to three
                            strategic hamlets, to the <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> training
                            center for Civil Guard units, as well as interviews with US unit
                            advisors in their areas of operations, and with all three of the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> Corps commanders. The field visits
                            covered generally the length of South Vietnam, from the 17th parallel to
                            the Delta, and measured some 1400 miles. Included also was a conference
                            with Chief, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Laos, a meeting with
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>, and a final
                            meeting with Commander, US Military Assistance Command, Commander in
                            Chief, Pacific and their staffs. The detailed itinerary is shown in
                            Appendix 5 and a map representation of the area covered is shown in
                            Appendix 6.</p>
                        <p>2. Impressions gained during the visit included the following:</p>
                        <p>a. <hi rend="italic">Strategic villages (townships) and strategic hamlets
                                (communities).</hi>—The program, in reality, is just beginning to
                            gain momentum, and unqualified conclusions as to its efficiency cannot
                            properly be drawn at this fume. It is plain, even at this early point,
                            that in the resettlement process often involved in the strategic hamlet
                            program, and in the attendant regimentation, the South Vietnamese
                            authorities are obliged to use some of the same arbitrary techniques as
                            the Communists themselves. It is to be hoped that the very real
                            motivations of ultimate freedom from terror, a sense of national or
                            local pride, and the prospect of a life of individual opportunity will
                            be enough to make the regimented system work. There is good reason to
                            believe that it will.</p>
                        <p>There are about 14,000 hamlets (small communities) in South Vietnam. As
                            of this fume, 1579 have been organized as strategic hamlets, with an
                            additional 1230 planned for this calendar year. Most of these actions
                            did not involve resettlement and were created on the original site of
                            the hamlets, in areas where the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            already exercised a strong measure of control. They are thus serving
                            mainly to solidify or to enhance the degree of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> control. A few, such as Ben Tuong, which was visited in
                            the Sunrise Project, and one seen near Ca Mao in Delta, were actually
                            created in areas which were liberated from <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> control. The Sunrise undertaking—a most ambitious effort
                            to clear the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> from an area 40 miles
                            northwest of Saigon—has proceeded satisfactorily to date, with a great
                            reduction of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> influence in the area and
                                <pb n="381" xml:id="pg_381" facs="0401"/>the creation of a
                            completely new strategic hamlet, into which families from the area have
                            been concentrated. The project is portrayed and described in detail in
                            Appendix 7.</p>
                        <p>The Strategic hamlet program undertaken near Ca Mao on the Delta
                            presented an equally impressive picture but from an entirely different
                            viewpoint. Here, the commander of the 31st Infantry Regiment had gone
                            into an area 95% controlled by the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>,
                            declared martial law, and resettled 11,000 people (some under duress) in
                            9 strategic hamlets, while fighting the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> wherever he found them. It is a bootstrap program,
                            essentially without material aid from outside. Since inception of the
                            program, none of his villages have been attacked, and the freedom from
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> taxation (extortion) is proving
                            most appealing to the people. It is the commander's hope (doubtless
                            optimistic) that he will be able to turn the whole area over to the
                            Civil Guard and Self Defense Corps within 6 months.</p>
                        <p>It would appear, at this early moment, that the strategic hamlet program
                            promises solid benefits, and may well be the vital key to success of the
                            pacification program. Plainly, it:</p>
                        <p>(1) Provides physical security for the villagers from the Communists.</p>
                        <p>(2) Precludes extortion of the people's limited means.</p>
                        <p>(3) Offers promise of a tranquil existence, and a substantially improved
                            economic condition.</p>
                        <p>(4) Provides for better housing, more education and a higher order of
                            health and sanitation.</p>
                        <p>(5) Impedes greatly the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> capability for
                            surviving off the land, both in terms of food and information.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, the program gives evidence of having weaknesses—all of
                            which are probably susceptible of correction. They include:</p>
                        <p>(1) A lack of adequate orientation for the people who must be resettled,
                            to make plain all the reasons why they should be willing to leave their
                            homes and fields and surrender some of their liberties.</p>
                        <p>(2) A shortage of competent <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            administrators to make the communities operate properly.</p>
                        <p>(3) Inefficient and unstandardized construction methods.</p>
                        <p>(4) A lack of warning communications.</p>
                        <p>(5) Insufficient training and equipment for local defense forces.</p>
                        <p>The first three of the above problems are on the way to solution now,
                            through a National Academy for Strategic Hamlets which opens on 17 May,
                            with an initial class of 500. The last two problems are most serious,
                            and each is deserving of separate treatment here, by virtue of their
                            magnitude and complexity.</p>
                        <p>b. <hi rend="italic">The training of Vietnamese paramilitary
                            forces.</hi>—The subversive technique adopted by the communists fixes
                            the hamlet as the decisive battle ground. The hearts and minds of the
                            villagers are the major <pb n="382" xml:id="pg_382" facs="0402"/>objective of the Viet Cong. Thus the security, prosperity and
                            tranquility of each hamlet needs, at all costs, to be preserved from
                            terror, violence and extortion, and this can be done best by young
                            people who (1) have a blood identity with the area and an interest in
                            its welfare; (2) have adequate arms, equipment and training for the
                            task; and (3) are properly organized and led. The program to accomplish
                            these things is just beginning to gain momentum. It has three
                            elements:</p>
                        <p>(1) Training of the Civil Guard (provincial paramilitary forces).—A visit
                            to the Song Mao Civil Guard Training Center disclosed an active and
                            effective program, capable of handling 15 Civil Guard companies at a
                            fume. During this calendar year it will give 12-week training courses to
                            188 of the existing 449 Civil Guard companies, or about 20,000 men. By
                            the end of next year 372 companies will be trained. These units will be
                            adequately armed and capable of small unit offensive action against the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, in local security tasks. One
                            problem in the program turns on what point in time the Civil Guard units
                            should be given their US weapons. At present the companies are inspected
                            at their home stations and, when found capable of handling them, are
                            issued the weapons at that fume. On this basis, a total of 338 Civil
                            Guard companies now have US weapons.</p>
                        <p>(2) Training of the Village Self Defense Corps.—This is a paramilitary
                            program, formalized and like the Civil Guard, involving paid, full-time
                            participation. It is less sophisticated than the Civil Guards. The
                                <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> is identified with the village
                            (township) in the same sense as the Civil Guard is identified with the
                            province. The program for the Self Defense Corps training is not as far
                            developed as Civil Guard training. It comprises a six-weeks basic course
                            at seven <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> training centers. The
                                <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> man is issued a US weapon on the
                            day his unit reports to the training center, and is held responsible for
                            the weapon thenceforward. Under the present program 65,000 <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> will have received training by 1 April
                            1963.</p>
                        <p>(3) Training of the Youth Corps.—This is an undertaking identified
                            specifically with the hamlet, and completes the paramilitary spectrum
                            from the province downward. The participants are unsaid volunteers, both
                            male and female. Their training is not standard, being accomplished by
                            various <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> units, and their weapons
                            are heterogeneous. Nevertheless, their importance is great, inasmuch as
                            the volunteers are actually a part of the hamlet which they undertake to
                            defend.</p>
                        <p>One Youth Corps group observed at the strategic hamlet of Luong Son near
                            Song Mau in the central part of the country, was obviously highly
                            motivated, but its weapons—ranging from shotguns to 1892 Mausers—gave
                            little cause for confidence. There is no crystalline program for Youth
                            Corps training, no detailed plan for its uniform armament, nor has a
                            plan been prepared to equate the Youth Corps requirement with the number
                            of strategic hamlets which will ultimately be created. <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss> was directed to have such a
                            plan developed, as a matter of urgency.</p>
                        <p>(4) The problem of warning communications.—The transmission of
                            intelligence reports and the processing of urgent reports of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> activity in the hinterland parallels
                            closely the paramilitary security <pb n="383" xml:id="pg_383" facs="0403"/>force problem. Communications are planned, from the
                            metropolitan level to the district, and from the district to the village
                            (township), but the hamlet, where the issue of violent subversion is
                            really joined, has not been firmly linked—even in planning—in the
                            communications system.</p>
                        <p>At the present time, 220 of 242 districts are linked with Saigon by
                            radio</p>
                        <p>At the next lower level, the plan contemplates 2400 village radios, of
                            which 215 had been installed by 2 May, with a forecast of 2019 by
                            October. In this connection, the need for completion of this project,
                            expressed by US personnel interviewed the length of South Vietnam, is
                            urgent.</p>
                        <p>At the lowest level, the hamlet, little has been done. It is acknowledged
                            locally that a communication system from hamlet to village is essential,
                            and a pilot group of 1000 very simple radio sets win be tested.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of Defense, in view of the importance of this project,
                            advised the Ambassador and <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss> that DOD would support the hamlet communication
                            project, and asked for an early and complete plan which relates the
                            communication need to the number of strategic hamlets contemplated.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">c. Visits to the I and II Corps Areas.—</hi>Both Corps
                            Areas are vast, comprising terrain of extreme military difficulty,
                            minimal road communications, a sensitive Laotian border and a wide
                            assortment of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> activity. In this
                            regard, probably the most significant tactical impression gained was
                            that the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> forces—doubtless because
                            of dynamic guidance by US advisers—are pressing aggressively to keep the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> off balance, and to make his
                            existence as unfruitful as possible. There seems little question but
                            that this vigor is paying off.</p>
                        <p>Small unit patrols, ambushes, attacks of company size, sweeps involving a
                            battalion or more, imaginative employment of helicopters, air
                            observation and heavier weapons—all must be having some effect on
                            denying initiative to the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> Eight such
                            recent operations are described, and critically analyzed, in Appendix
                            8.</p>
                        <p>A point of possible significance, in connection with the increased scale
                            of helicopter-borne operations is the fact that the pilot area of the
                            aircraft is suffering hits with increasing frequency, leading to the
                            possible conclusion that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are
                            learning to concentrate on the pilot. This, in turn, raises once again
                            the matter of whether there should not be some form of suppressive
                            weapon integral with a fraction of the assault helicopters.</p>
                        <p>Specific observations regarding visits to the Corps Areas include:</p>
                        <p>(1) An imaginative utilization of education, civic action and
                            psychological activity has resulted in the voluntary resettlement of
                            11,900 people in the Kontum area. It could well be done elsewhere, but
                            success apparently demands the happy combination of a willing provincial
                            authority, a vigorous <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> commander
                            and a dynamic US advisor.</p>
                        <pb n="384" xml:id="pg_384" facs="0404"/>
                        <p>(2) The primitive country is an ideal setting for exploitation of our
                            superior mobility in the helicopter and our superior radio communication
                            capability. In both Corps Areas a desire was expressed for more of this
                            support, particularly helicopters. At the present fume, there are
                            scarcely enough helicopters for operational purposes, leaving the
                            logistic problems involved in supply and evacuation for remote patrols
                            to be solved by slower and less effective means. It is most likely that
                            more helicopters are needed.</p>
                        <p>(3) There is little infiltration by sea reported, attesting to the
                            effectiveness of the maritime patrol. The same is hue with respect to
                            the 17th parallel. Some increase in infiltration across the Laotian
                            border was reported by the I Corps commander, following the growth of
                            communist activity at Tchepone in Laos.</p>
                        <p>(4) US advisers in both Corps commented upon the great need for more
                            junior officers and <gloss target="#t_NCO1">NCO</gloss>s in both <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> and Civil Guard units. In some
                            organizations the number is as low as 15 to 25% of the authorized
                            strength.</p>
                        <p>(5) Advisers in both Corps were enthusiastic about the value of civic
                            action, and urge acceleration in training of Vietnamese administrators
                            in community development. They express a need for medical supplies for
                            civic action purposes.</p>
                        <p>(6) In contemplating the sum of the operations in I and II Corps, it was
                            not possible to overlook the reality that these activities actually do
                            relatively little to impede movement across the long and rugged Laotian
                            border, a practical fact which assumes even greater importance in light
                            of current developments in Laos.</p>
                        <p>d. <hi rend="italic">Conference With Chief <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, Laos.—</hi>The Chief, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Laos joined the party at Nha Trang during the visit to
                            I and II Corps, and gave a late summary of events in Laos. His recital
                            of the developing situation paralleled closely the official reports
                            available in Washington from other sources. However, he added the
                            following personal views, which are significant:</p>
                        <p>(1) That he had earlier appealed to the Laotian military leadership to
                            readjust their low-ground defenses at Nam Tha, without success.</p>
                        <p>(2) That the Laotian private soldier involved in the Nam Tha fighting
                            gave a reasonably good account of himself, but that the officer and
                                <gloss target="#t_NCO1">NCO</gloss> leadership was gravely
                            deficient, and that the pusillanimous example was set at the very
                            top.</p>
                        <p>(3) That this weakness which, in his views, is widespread, gives rise to
                            the conclusion that what is left of the Laotian Army cannot be expected
                            to fight with any effectiveness.</p>
                        <p>(4) That there are grave doubts, in his mind, as to the real violence of
                            the fighting, following the initial blow at Nam Tha, inasmuch as the
                            field commander took pains to prevent direct US observation of the
                            operation, and inasmuch as few casualties were noted.</p>
                        <p>(5) That there is a substantial logistic build-up along the whole of the
                            former cease-fire line; that logistic activity in the Tchepone area is
                            growing; and that an attack may well be expected in the general area</p>

                            the largest involving about 50 men. Present <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> organized strength is estimated at 16,500. While this is

                            of accurate reporting than of lesser numbers. There are estimated to be
                            at least 100,000 active communist guerrillas. With regard to these
                            facts, it is likely that we shall be getting better information in the

                            multitude of imponderables involved. It has to do with the
                            control—geographic and by population—exercised over the country by the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and by the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. The geographic picture is presented in
                            Appendix 9, with a detailed rationalization. In essence, it says
                            that:</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> controls 14.7% of the
                            country.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is in the ascendancy in 24% of
                            the country.</p>
                        <p>Neither the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> nor <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> controls 18.3% of the country.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> is in the ascendancy in 24.8% of
                            the country.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> controls 17.4% of the country.</p>
                        <p>In terms of population, the picture is brighter, in that:</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> controls 18.1% of the
                            country.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is in the ascendancy in 37.8% of
                            the country.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> is in the ascendancy m 11.4% of the
                            country.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> controls 15.6% of the country. </p>
                        <p>The above population figures, moreover, are developed without considering
                            the 1.7 million people in the cities, essentially, all of whom are under
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> control.</p>
                        <p>Another interesting index to the trend of affairs is portrayed in
                            Appendix 10, which shows, for a 5 month period, the trend of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> combat losses in killed, wounded,
                            deserted and defected, as well as weapons lost, contrasted to the same
                            figures for the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. The trend is plainly
                            a favorable one.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Vietnam Summary</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>a. US military forces in South Vietnam are acquitting themselves well,
                            exhibiting much energy, great initiative and imagination in dealing with
                            their Vietnamese counterparts.</p>
                        <p>b. There are skill some material needs in <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>. Vietnam—helicopters, hamlet communications, and suitable
                            arms for paramilitary forces. <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> is
                            aware of each problem and has been directed to submit specific
                            proposals.</p>
                        <p>c. There remain urgent training and organizational problems related to
                            hamlet security. These too, are recognized by <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb n="387" xml:id="pg_387" facs="0407"/>
                        <p>d. Beyond this, and in a broader sense, there was an atmosphere of
                            restrained optimism evident in every area visited, on the part of both
                            US and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> personnel. All the way from
                            the intensely proud attitude of the administrator of a strategic hamlet
                            to the military and civil leadership at the top, the Vietnamese exhibit
                            confidence and resolution. The US participants in the battle are
                            likewise solid in their determination that the future holds genuine
                            promise. At the same time, there seems to be universal comprehension of
                            the inevitable reality that for fifteen prior years the war in Vietnam
                            was in the process of being lost—progressively and day by day—and that
                            there is no alchemy or magic that can convert that sort of loss into a
                            dramatic victory overnight. Put otherwise, there is evident a general
                            conviction—first, that victory is clearly attainable through the
                            mechanisms that are now in motion and, second, that hopefully, it will
                            not take fifteen years fully to consummate it.</p>

                            <item>The Communists and South Viet Nam</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>In making future assessments of the effect which our military/diplomatic
                            role in Viet Nam has on the Communists I believe we should keep the
                            following elements in mind. The list is not exhaustive. I have discussed
                            the following with Consul General Green and key members of his staff in
                            Hong Kong. They have made sound contributions and agree generally.</p>
                        <p>1. The ChiCom-Russian split. The Russians think Communism can make gains
                            without local wars. They will back wars of “National Liberation”
                            provided the risks are controllable. The ChiComs think local wars are
                            the best way to spread Communism and will accept higher risks. (Moral:
                            if we prove the Russians right, we are lost.)</p>
                        <pb n="388" xml:id="pg_388" facs="0408"/>
                        <p>2. For all their toughness the ChiComs are realists. Given their economic
                            plight and because they will not have an effective way of delivering the
                            bomb in the foreseeable future, they don't want a major war. Proviso: If
                            they thought they were being attacked, they would stop at nothing. (We
                            can communicate our limited intentions to the ChiComs by our acts.)</p>
                        <p>3. If the ChiComs took over all <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>, it
                            would not solve their immediate rice problem. Later they would quadruple
                            the rice production of <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>, but this
                            would not permanently solve their rice problems. They probably know this
                            and we can assume that they will not move into <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> because of their food problem.</p>
                        <p>4. The North Vietnamese have committed their prestige to the conquest of
                            South Vietnam, but they will not voluntarily accept massive ChiCom
                            assistance. They know that to gain South Viet Nam by this method would
                            lead, in turn, to being swallowed by the ChiComs. They have an abiding,
                            neighborly hatred dating back 1500 years.</p>
                        <p>5. The North Vietnamese react badly to internal, covert dangers. As
                            orientals they do not naturally band together to face a common danger.
                            This tendency to look out for themselves is accentuated by Communist
                            training to act as separate cells and cadres and to spy on each other.
                            There are already indications that the North Vietnamese are afraid of
                            sabotage, that there is an atmosphere of distrust which can no longer be
                            papered over by warring revolutionary zeal (these tensions should be
                            discreetly exploited).</p>
                        <p>6. The South Vietnamese peasants fear the Communists more than their own
                            Government. If convinced they have the means to resist the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, they will. If convinced they don't have
                            the means, they will, through fear, give the Viet Cong more than they
                            will the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>7. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> wants to win its own war. It
                            now realizes the importance of Civic Action as a means of helping the
                            peasant. The confusions in this program are not insuperable. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has not yet fully faced the other side
                            of the coin—to really root out the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> it
                            will be necessary for <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> units to
                            stay out in the field longer and with less support than is now the case
                            (experience will help them gain the confidence to do this, but we must
                            also help through joint planning and by supplying the right kind of
                            light equipment. We must not let them become so dependent on daily US
                            provisions that they can't be weaned and hardened off into the
                            jungles).</p>
                        <p>8. International Conference—At present the Communists (Russia, the
                            ChiComs and North Viet Nam) would only come out for a conference if they
                            felt they could gain two objectives: i. a neutralized <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> really ripe for the takeover (they were
                            fooled on this one in 1954 and would want to be satisfied); ii. paint an
                            “aggression” label clearly on the U.S. without any rubbing off on
                            themselves (that is why we must work so hard to get the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> to pin “subversion” on them).</p>
                        <pb n="389" xml:id="pg_389" facs="0409"/>
                        <p>In the future when the war goes badly for the Communists, they will want
                            a conference (this will test our nerve. We should remember the
                            Communists understand our actions. If we agree to a conference, they
                            will assume it to be an act of weakness. We must assume that a
                            conference will not lead to an agreement which will bind them. By the
                            thrust and parry of diplomatic and military action we can reach a de
                            facto understanding, but we should only do so when the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has the ability to exercise sovereign
                            control over South Viet Nam. Finally the publicity of a conference on
                            Viet Nam is apt to make it a poor form of diplomacy, particularly since
                            our friends and allies are apt to get into a greater degree of public
                            disarray than the Communists).</p>

                            in Laos, the Joint Chiefs propose ordering the establishment of the US
                            Military Assistance Command, Thailand (<gloss target="#t_USMACTHAI1">USMACTHAI</gloss>). General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Paul

                                (<gloss target="#t_USMACV1">USMACV</gloss>) will additionally assume
                            command of <gloss target="#t_USMACTHAI1">USMACTHAI</gloss>. As head of
                                <gloss target="#t_USMACTHAI1">USMACTHAI</gloss>, General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> will command Joint Task

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Communist Reactions:</p>
                        <p>The limited purpose of our military buildup in Southeast Asia may have
                            been made abundantly clear publicly and in private approaches to the
                            Soviets. Moscow is, in our view, likely to give credence to the
                            limitations we assert. Peiping and Hanoi, however, are more directly
                            concerned than Moscow, and we think they are apt to view our assertions
                            with a jaundiced eye; they will be quick to draw conclusions from any of
                            our actions which do not, in their view, square with our limited
                            objective. Thus, we believe both Peiping and Hanoi likely at a minimum
                            to regard the establishment of <gloss target="#t_USMACTHAI1">USMACTHAI</gloss> under General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> (with all his other responsibilities) as an
                            indicator of US intent to draw a line in a permanent fashion from
                            Thailand through Laos to South Vietnam. They will believe this not only
                            threatens their position in southern Laos, but their support of the Viet
                            Cong in South Vietnam as well. As long as we are not compelled to move
                            US/Thai troops into Laos itself, this conception on their part is of no
                                <pb n="391" xml:id="pg_391" facs="0411"/>great significance. If we
                            move into Laos, however, it is almost certain to make them more likely
                            to initiate hostile action against US and Thai troops than we have
                            previously estimated. They would have great difficulty, as we crossed
                            the Mekong into southern Laos, in not concluding that this was the
                            beginning of an effort to pinch off the whole southern panhandle.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. In US Policy Terms:</p>
                        <p>In South Vietnam we are assisting a national government in a divided
                            country to check and beat back an insurgency. We are going to great
                            pains to make clear that it is not our war but that of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. With respect to Laos we are mounting a
                            deterrent to further communist territorial encroachment so as to create
                            the conditions in which a new government of national union can be formed
                            and the area neutralized. Only if neutralization proves impossible would
                            we consider armed intercession to effect a de facto partition. US policy
                            is differentiated for the two areas. A central regional military command
                            does not reflect this policy differentiation, and indeed it cuts across
                            the concept. When the new command structure becomes public, the question
                            will be not whether the policy and command problems are different, but
                            whether the policy has changed.</p>

                            clear that the Ambassador is to “oversee and coordinate all the
                            activities of the US Government” in the country to which he is
                            accredited. An exception was made in the case of “US forces operating in
                            the field where such forces are under the command of a US area military
                            commander.” It is not clear whether General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> becomes a “US area military
                            commander” responsible to another US area military commander (Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName>). If so, some
                            confusion arises as to the responsibility of the Ambassadors in Thailand
                            and South Vietnam (and perhaps eventually in Laos); more importantly
                            this could lead to a greater confusion in policy recommendations from
                            the area, with the JCS claiming a direct line to the President. If not,
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> is put in a
                            difficult position of being overseen and coordinated by two (or
                            potentially three) US Ambassadors.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. In Laos:</p>
                        <p>Announcement of the command is likely to make it more difficult to
                            persuade <persName corresp="#p_PN3">Phoumi</persName> that US military
                            moves are directed toward making a political solution possible. Equally
                            important, it would tend to <pb n="392" xml:id="pg_392" facs="0412"/>reinforce his personal position within the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> at a time when the US is preparing to reduce his
                            political stature and even to seek his replacement. To <persName corresp="#p_PN3">Phoumi</persName> and others in the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> the implied linking of US military
                            operations in South Vietnam and Laos would bolster hopes of securing
                            southern Laos. There is recent evidence that <persName corresp="#p_PN3">Phoumi</persName> has this thought the more in mind since the loss
                            of northwestern Laos. It would also strengthen the force of his appeal
                            (“we are fighting the same battle”) for support from South Vietnam and
                            South Korea.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">5. In South Vietnam:</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> is not likely to feel overly
                            sensitive to the broadening of General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>' authority beyond the borders of South Vietnam,
                            and whatever deflation of Saigon's stature may be implied will be
                            compensated by the vision it opens for <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> (as for <persName corresp="#p_PN3">Phoumi</persName>) of pinching off southern Laos.</p>
                        <p>At the popular level, making the senior American military officer in
                            South Vietnam the commander of Southeast Asia plays directly into
                            Communist hands. The war in South Vietnam is a villagers' war. They are
                            nationalistic and sensitive to the possible reimposition of a colonial
                            regime—this time American. The Viet Cong works hard on this theme, and
                            will now have additional rationale.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">6. In Thailand:</p>
                        <p>The Thais have little interest in the South Vietnamese situation but
                            great interest in protecting their entire border with Laos. <persName corresp="#p_PN3">Phoumi</persName> may well seek to enlist their
                            support in interesting the new <gloss target="#t_USMACTHAI1">USMACTHAI</gloss> in pinching off southern Laos, but to the extent
                            that they support this thought it will be without prejudice to their
                            interest in protecting their northern borders. The end result could be
                            an expansion of Thai expectations of US actions in their security
                            interest.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">7. In Cambodia, Burma, Malaya, Japan, India:</p>
                        <p>At a minimum there is likely to be immediate and public questioning of US
                            intentions. The bloc will do its best to manipulate the propaganda
                            effects in these countries as adversely to US interest as possible.
                            Sihanouk in particular is likely to be most upset by what to him will
                            appear a hedging in of his country.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation:</p>
                        <p>In view of the non-military policy disadvantages we see to the present
                            conception of a command structure in Southeast Asia, we suggest that a
                            more appropriate structure (if military considerations are not
                            overriding) might be based on the following principles:</p>
                        <pb n="393" xml:id="pg_393" facs="0413"/>
                        <p>1. There should be no connection apparent directly between <gloss target="#t_USMACV1">USMACV</gloss> and our command in Thailand or
                            Joint Task Force 116.</p>
                        <p>2. The command in Thailand should not be a Military Assistance Command
                            (which obviously parallels our set-up in a totally different situation
                            in South Vietnam).</p>
                        <p>3. The deterrent buildup should be susceptible to ready dismantling once
                            its purpose has been achieved. It will undoubtedly be difficult
                            vis-à-vis the Thai Government, for example, to retrogress (as they will
                            see it) from <gloss target="#t_USMACTHAI1">USMACTHAI</gloss> to <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> once the Southeast Asian buildup has
                            served its hoped-for purpose with respect to Laos. If we really intend
                            to create a long-term <gloss target="#t_USMACTHAI1">USMACTHAI</gloss>,
                            it should not be done by the back door.</p>
                        <p>4. Since there is no <hi rend="italic">immediate</hi> threat to Thailand,
                            the US forces sent to Southeast Asia in connection with Laos (even if
                            introduced into Thailand) should be under command of (for example) JTF
                            116. This will tend to dramatize the temporary and limited purpose of
                            their presence in the area.</p>

                        <p>I believe the time has come to force a confrontation on the role of Hanoi
                            in Southeast Asia and thus bring our Laos and South Vietnam policies
                            clearly into line.</p>
                        <p>The common stand has been, of course, that we are trying to force the
                            return of North Vietnamese forces to their own borders; but this fact
                            has been obscured in our diplomacy, our military posture towards Laos,
                            and in the public consciousness.</p>
                        <p>The fact is that the Nam Tha operation and the whole Communist operation
                            in Laos has depended on North Vietnamese forces which are operating
                            extra-legally.</p>
                        <pb n="394" xml:id="pg_394" facs="0414"/>
                        <p>They evidently hope that we either fail to react now or react in such a
                            way as to permit a de facto split which would have the effect of
                            permitting North Vietnam (and probably Communist China) to take over
                            Northern Laos, continue to chew away at a demoralized Southern Laos, and
                            hold the corridor to South Vietnam. This is a bad and unstable outcome
                            which, I would predict, will force us to put U.S. troops into Southeast
                            Asia at a later and more disadvantageous time to protect vital U.S.
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>I would propose, therefore, that our next moves be designed to put the
                            heat directly on Hanoi—in the context of both Laos and South
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Specifically—</p>
                        <p>1. We should inform Moscow that we are counting on continued Soviet
                            support for the Laos solution agreed between us at the highest level;
                            i.e., a neutral, independent Laos. We have moved the politics of the RLG
                            in this direction and are prepared to move them further. But the role of
                            North Vietnam in Laos, in the context of the Nam Tha engagement, is
                            unacceptable to us, as is the North Vietnam role in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>2. We should inform Hanoi by some reliable route that their role in both
                            Northern Laos and South Vietnam is unacceptable to us; that we are
                            prepared for a neutral and independent Laos and for a return to the
                            Geneva Accords in South Vietnam; but that we shall have to take direct
                            retaliatory action if they continue on their present path.</p>
                        <p>3. We should move carrier forces into the South China Sea south of the
                            17th parallel.</p>
                        <p>4. In addition to the possible movement of the U.S. battalion to the Laos
                            border in Thailand and of naval forces into the Gulf of Siam, we should
                            signal our seriousness of intent by:</p>
                        <p>(i) a Jungle Jim attack on Tchepone:</p>
                        <p>(ii) a small but overt Jungle Jim attack on a North Vietnamese rail line.
                            (They have been systematically harassing the South Vietnamese
                            railroads.)</p>
                        <p>5. We should ask the Australians to inform the Chinese Communists that if
                            the situation in Laos deteriorates they will have to hold up their grain
                            shipments.</p>
                        <p>6. This line of action is not only based on an assessment of vital U.S.
                            interests but also on an estimate of Soviet, Chinese Communist, and
                            North Vietnamese intentions and capabilities.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Moscow</hi>. Soviet behavior suggests that they have
                            agreed to let Hanoi and Peiping experiment with extended aggression in
                            Laos; but there is no indication that they are prepared to let their

                            i.e., a Communist exploitation of our pressure on <persName corresp="#p_PN3">Phoumi</persName>. And this we should not
                            take.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Hanoi</hi>. Ho perceives that it may be possible that
                            the U.S. will not react and thus permit a Communist takeover in Laos;
                            but, in any case, he is clear a split would be better than a unified
                            government involving North Vietnamese withdrawal and loss or degradation
                            of the Tchepone corridor. He is persuaded by our actions thus far that
                            he can pursue this game and the game in South Vietnam without
                            endangering his North Vietnam base, since we have reacted to his
                            extra-legal actions only inside Laos and inside the 17th parallel. But
                            his domestic base is weak-weakened by another bad harvest.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Peiping</hi>. By reason of its abiding ambitions in
                            Southeast Asia and its desire to lead the Asian Communist movements,
                            Peiping is backing Ho. Basically, however, the Chinese Communist
                            domestic situation has never been so weak. By every indicator, popular
                            morale is bad, people are hungry, industrial production is radically
                            down, and they calculate that for the next years their dependence on
                            Western grain will increase. We have, in fact, within the week two
                            separate indications that we shall soon have a direct indication of
                            Chinese Communist desire to buy U.S. wheat. It seems outlandish, but a
                            first-class <hi rend="italic">Christian Science Monitor</hi>
                            correspondent in Hong Kong wrote a piece (which you should read)
                            entitled “Peace for Food.” It suggests that the Chinese Communists have
                            encouraged Nam Tha in order to gain bargaining leverage with the U.S.
                            for a Laos settlement versus a food deal. This is, of course, a long
                            shot; but it is essential to look at the incredible state of the Chinese
                            Communist domestic scene in making our assessment of the proper U.S.
                            course of action.</p>
                        <p>7. The course I propose is based on the defense of vital U.S. interests,
                            not on pious hopes. We should not undertake it unless we are prepared to
                            back our play. But I believe that if we are bold enough, lucid enough in
                            our communications, and make it clear that Hanoi cannot any longer
                            safely be used as a Communist cats-paw without paying a direct price, we
                            have a fair chance that we can foreshorten both the Laos and Vietnam
                            crises. But down the line, quite conceivably, could be a China grain
                            deal.</p>

                        <p>Suggested Response to President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s Letter of March 31</p>
                        <p>On March 31 President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>, at our
                            suggestion, sent a letter to the Pope and to 92 heads of Free World
                            states calling attention to the Communist assault on his country and
                            requesting Free World moral support. This action is intended to
                            reinforce the impact on world opinion of our report and the U.S.-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> Joint Communiqué of January 4. The
                            effect of the letter would be strengthened by a public response from
                            you. It is not intended to prompt a continuing dialogue between you and
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>We think it would be desirable for several replies from other heads of
                            state to be received before yours. The United Kingdom and Cambodia have
                            already replied. The Koreans have issued a formal statement of support.
                            The Filipinos say they intend to reply soon, and we have urged the Thais
                            to reply quickly.</p>
                        <p>A suggested text for your reply to <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> is enclosed as a proposed telegram to Saigon.</p>
                        <p>You may wish to call attention to <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s letter and your response at your next press
                            conference. You might also take this opportunity to observe that the
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> letter is a good
                            statement of the threat not only to Viet-Nam, but to all Free Nations,
                            that the U.S. remains determined to help the brave Vietnamese people
                            defend themselves, and that we hope all Free World nations will
                            contribute what they can to the defense of Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>I recommend that you approve the enclosed telegram to Saigon and that you
                            refer to the exchange of letters at your next press conference along the

                        <p>Your letter of March 31 places before the world the picture of a brave
                            and determined people fighting to maintain their independence. You have
                            again exposed Communist responsibility for the continued bloodshed and
                            destruction in Viet-Nam by pointing to new and blatant <pb n="398" xml:id="pg_398" facs="0418"/>evidence that it is directed from
                            Hanoi. And you have asked that the nations of the Free World raise their
                            voices in condemnation of this brutal attack.</p>
                        <p>Your letter, addressed to chiefs of state and government, will serve the
                            cause of freedom throughout the world by again alerting free men to the
                            menace of Communist aggression. The world must mark well the daily
                            heroism and sacrifices of your people—and the reasons for them.</p>
                        <p>For our own part, we cannot express too strongly the indignation we feel
                            when we consider the nature of the war against your people. Unable to
                            compete in peace with your thriving nation, unable indeed even to feed
                            adequately their own hungry people, yet determined to destroy what they
                            cannot equal, the Communists in Hanoi have employed systematic terror
                            against your whole population. The conscience of the world is deeply
                            troubled by this savage and unnecessary war.</p>
                        <p>The United States condemns in the strongest terms the authors of the
                            violence in Viet-Nam. We hope that our voice, added to that of other
                            Free Nations, may cause the Communists to pause. In the past we have
                            repeatedly urged them to give up their designs for conquest in favor of
                            peaceful plans for the betterment of all mankind. In particular, we have
                            asked that they abandon their effort to conquer the Vietnamese nation.
                            We again call upon them to cease their attacks on your people and on the
                            Free World.</p>
                        <p>But we cannot be content to appeal by words alone to the Communist
                            authorities in Hanoi. Meanwhile, we have already increased our economic
                            and military assistance to your nation, and we will continue that
                            support in order that your courageous people may both build and protect
                            what they are building. The Communists label as aggression the
                            extraordinary efforts we are making to assist you and your own efforts
                            of self-defense. If they want us to cease these extraordinary efforts
                            they need only call off their own attacks upon you.</p>
                        <p>The United States is not alone in its support, both moral and material,
                            of your embattled country. Many other friendly countries are already
                            contributing to your defense. It is our hope that additional Free World
                            nations will also assist you in every way possible, realizing that to
                            help another country preserve its independence is a way of protecting
                            one's own independence—and the best way.</p>
                        <p>We are confident of your ultimate success. The strength and the courage
                            of your nation will prevail. Peace will be restored in Viet-Nam, and
                            your people will again be free to build their own future in peace, in
                            their own way and in their own great traditions.</p>

                        <p>Re Dept's comments on replacement approach we recognize validity colonial
                            point. However, Commies already charge us with colonialism and we
                            inclined to doubt that they can get much propaganda mileage out of our
                            essentially legal argument.<note n="4" xml:id="d194fn4">In the margin

                        </p>
                        <p>Re legal soundness this approach, seems to us that legally it is same
                            approach that we used in 1960 with <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>
                            in increasing <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> from 342 to 685 and
                            would appear just as sound now as then. As for 888 ceiling on US forces
                            we stated in 1960 that this was number of US-French military training
                            personnel in Viet Nam, but we are now shifting to wider category of
                            military personnel for obvious reasons in view change of military
                            situation in South Viet Nam.<note n="5" xml:id="d194fn5">In the margin
                                next to this paragraph was written: “<gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> never really accepted it. Thus—only took

                        <p>We believe this approach would probably take care of most equipment but
                            cannot state this definitely until comparative study now in progress of
                            credits, “justifications of title” and actual equipment introduction has
                            been completed. To extent this approach would not take care of equipment
                            it would be handled either clandestinely or by claim that it covered by
                            outshipments for which <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> has lost

                            believe it is worth trying out on them unless Delhi believes mere
                            broaching of idea would increase Indian suspicions US motives in manner
                            which cannot be dispelled.</p>

                            pressures for international conference on Viet Nam. This would be
                            particularly the case if, as is likely, war activities on both sides in

                            about international conference as Russian position can quickly change
                            when Russians see advantage to be gained from conference. Moreover we

                        </p>
                        <p>1. We consider introduction of additional US military personnel and
                            military equipment into South Viet-Nam over past six <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402" facs="0422"/>months as fully justified by
                            self-defense requirements of Republic of Viet-Nam to meet guerrilla war
                            directed and supported by Communist authorities in Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>2. We believe these additional military measures are also reconcilable
                            with purpose and provisions of Geneva Agreement on Viet-Nam as outlined
                            below.</p>
                        <p>3. A basic purpose of Geneva Agreement on Viet-Nam was to establish
                            balance of military power between two zones of Viet-Nam. In case of
                            military personnel, this is implicit in Article 16 of agreement, which
                            states “with effect from date of entry into force of present agreement,
                            introduction into Viet-Nam of any troop ‘reinforcements’ and
                            ‘additional’ military personnel is prohibited”.</p>
                        <p>4. In this context agreement makes no reference to nationality, or
                            function foreign military personnel. Therefore, Article 16 seems solely
                            concerned with preserving military status quo in terms foreign military
                            personnel, regardless of origin or function those personnel.</p>
                        <p>5. Withdrawal of French Union Forces subsequent to signing of agreement
                            in effect altered the balance between two military forces which
                            prevailed at time agreement put into effect.</p>
                        <p>6. To meet the increasing threat of subversion and aggression directed
                            against it by Hanoi authorities, Government of Republic of Viet-Nam
                            requested introduction of additional American military personnel to
                            assist its forces in training, advisory, and support activities. Since
                            number these American personnel totals only very small proportion of
                            total number personnel in French Union Forces in Viet-Nam at time
                            agreement signed, and since agreement itself establishes no limitations
                            on nationality or function such personnel, it is clear that introduction
                            of present American military personnel into Viet-Nam does not violate
                            the balance of military power established by agreement between two zones
                            of Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>7. In regard to question of war material, basic purpose of agreement
                            similarly implied in article 1 7(A) which states “ … <note n="3" xml:id="d195fn3">Ellipses in this paragraph are in the source
                                text.</note> introduction into Viet-Nam of any ‘reinforcements’ in
                            form of all types of arms, munitions, and other war material…is
                            prohibited”. Article 17(B) further states “it is understood, however,
                            that war material, arms and munitions which have been destroyed,
                            damaged, or worn out or used up after cessation of hostilities may be
                            replaced on basis of piece-for-piece of same type and with similar
                            characteristics”.</p>
                        <p>8. Again, withdrawal of French Union Forces and export from Viet-Nam of
                            most their arms, equipment, and material contributed to altering the
                            prevailing balance of military power between two zones, since this
                            material has also never been replaced entirely.</p>
                        <pb n="403" xml:id="pg_403" facs="0423"/>
                        <p>9. In 1958 the International Control Commission itself recognized that
                            this principle of replacement of French Union Forces' war material was
                            justified under agreement. The Commission thereupon devised system of
                            crediting Government of Republic of Viet-Nam with amounts of material
                            the disposal of which Commission had controlled. However, these amounts
                            have comprised only a part of material which French Union Forces
                            actually possessed at time agreement went into effect and which they
                            subsequently exported. Obviously, any effort to reinstate 1954 military
                            status quo should take into consideration all equipment out-shipped by
                            French Union Forces after 1954.</p>
                        <p>10. Equity also indicates that certain items present in 1954 which have
                            become obsolete or unavailable can be justifiably replaced by items of
                            generally same type and similar characteristics, allowing for changes in
                            supply and warfare methods.</p>
                        <p>11. It is by no means purpose of either Government of Republic of
                            Viet-Nam or American authorities to restore entirely and in every
                            respect capability of French Union Forces at time of signing of Geneva
                            Agreement; on contrary, only aim is to take those minimum additional
                            measures absolutely necessary to meet the growing guerrilla war threat
                            by the Hanoi authorities to security and integrity of Republic of
                            Viet-Nam. These temporary additional measures will be terminated when
                            that threat is eliminated.</p>

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> made the
                            following points in connection with the South Viet-Nam Status Report of
                            16 May:<note n="2" xml:id="d196fn2">Dated May 16, it was one of a series
                                of status reports on progress made under instructions issued to
                                Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> required
                                by <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 111, November 22, 1961.
                                (Kennedy Library, National Security Files, Vietnam Status Reports
                                11)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>a. Neither General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> nor
                            he agrees with the concept of diverting four special battalions to a
                            program of research and experimentation. General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> is going to take this up
                            with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        </p>
                        <p>b. The paragraph in the Status Report on defoliation is not accurate. The
                            facts are that a report is expected momentarily from Viet-Nam giving the
                            results of further tests; based on this, a decision might well be
                            requested to continue with such operations. He pointed out that it has
                            been determined that failures to date were due to incorrect strength of
                            the defoliant and to improper use of the nozzles used in dispensing it.
                            It is believed that these factors can be corrected.</p>
                        <p>c. The matter of crop destruction is being looked at further. (Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> cautioned that care
                            must be taken in embarking on any such program in Montagnard areas.)</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> then gave the
                            Group some highlights of his recent trip to Southeast Asia. Points
                            mentioned were:</p>
                        <p>a. The South Vietnamese have a very good training center for Civil Guard
                            and Self Defense Corps companies.</p>
                        <p>b. The build-up of defended areas is going well. (In answer to the
                            Attorney General's question, General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> said he was unable to reconcile Homer Bigart's
                            article of today<note n="3" xml:id="d196fn3">See <hi rend="italic">The
                                    New York Times</hi>, May 17. 1962.</note> with these
                            observations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>
                            suggested that General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName>
                            might wish to send a note to the President, pointing out Bigart's
                            inaccuracy, if this proves to be the case.)</p>
                        <p>c. The Border Patrol Force is working well.</p>
                        <p>d. Efforts are underway to produce maps which will indicate more dearly
                            than heretofore the areas controlled by each side.</p>
                        <p>e. The village radio system is good. However, there is still a gap to be
                            filled in communications between the central village and its component
                            hamlets.</p>
                        <p>f. Relations between the Embassy and the <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> command are excellent</p>
                        <p>g. It would be useful to arm additional numbers of Montagnards.</p>
                        <pb n="405" xml:id="pg_405" facs="0425"/>
                        <p>Mr. Coffin reported that certain projects, notably those involving the
                            police and radios, are being held up because of a reluctance on the part
                            of the Vietnamese Government to commit local funds. It was agreed that
                            this is a problem that will have to be worked out on the spot.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> pointed to the
                            necessity of finding a strong replacement for the present <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> Chief as soon as possible.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>As you know, I had planned to propose to the Committee at tomorrow's
                            meeting that we react to the coming on stream of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s new radio transmitters with a hard
                            look at the content of counter-insurgency information activities. Since
                            I cannot attend the meeting, perhaps you could propose the idea and see
                            what happens? If there is adequate encouragement, my thought is that
                            perhaps each agency could put together a report within, say, a week
                            which you and I would undertake to wrap up in a sort of working paper
                            for discussion at the next meeting. I realize, of course, that this is
                            something less than a new idea, and that a good many people have already
                            sweated at length over this problem. But I'm told that there has not
                            been an effort to look at it collectively in this fashion.</p>
                        <p>In any case, it seems to me we should try to sort out four questions:</p>
                        <p>1) How effective, vis-à-vis the insurgency problem, is the propaganda now
                            being directed at the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and the
                            Vietnamese people?</p>
                        <p>Replies to my superficial enquiries have been unanimous that the content
                            of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> propaganda is poor. The most
                            common complaint was that it is too negative, with heavy-handed emphasis
                            on what the regime is against, instead of what it's for. At yesterday's
                            ceremonies <pb n="406" xml:id="pg_406" facs="0426"/>opening the new
                            Saigon transmitter, for example, Minister Hieu talked first about the
                            sins of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and then about “the three
                            enemies”: Communism, disunity, and backwardness. The sense of his
                            remarks was that the new radio facilities would be devoted more or less
                            exclusively to the battle against those things. Just about the only
                            positive thought in his speech was a relatively secondary reference to
                            personalism, which he elaborated in only one or two sentences.</p>
                        <p>One of the most helpful errors of Communist propaganda worldwide is that
                            it is monumentally long-winded and boring. Is the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> pitch committing the same mistake?
                            Minister Hieu remarked to me the other night that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> propaganda at the boondocks level was
                            now avoiding all mention of President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> and talking instead about specific boondocks
                            problems. Apart from the controversy about the <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> regime, can you reach the
                            Vietnamese peasant without offering him a leader? Is the suppression of
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s name a surrender to
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> propaganda, or to stateside press
                            criticism, or perhaps inescapable in the present circumstances? Is it
                            true that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> propaganda (as well as our
                            own supporting efforts) uniformly depicts the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> as baby-murdering, arsonist monsters? Is this a true
                            picture of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> as it is known to the
                            majority of the peasants in the red and pink areas whom we are trying to
                            reach? In short is the present pitch credible?</p>
                        <p>Does anyone have a really hard reading on how well <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> propaganda is working in the rural
                            areas? Among town dwellers who probably have not had first-hand contact
                            with the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>? Is adequate consideration
                            being given to the probability that the pitch to town dwellers should be
                            different from the pitch to peasants?</p>
                        <p>(Of course there is also the equally basic question of whether existing
                            propaganda programs are really arriving in the target areas, regardless
                            of the quality of the content. Should the heavy emphasis be on radio, or
                            village newspapers, or airdropped leaflets, or what? But this perhaps
                            should be the subject of a separate study.)</p>
                        <p>2) Is it possible to establish broad guidelines on ways to improve <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> propaganda?</p>
                        <p>Is it possible, for example, to laugh at the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, to make them look ridiculous and thus lose face? For
                            village level consumption, can a more subtle approach be used, with less
                            emphasis on terror and more on Communist techniques for capturing and
                            destroying a man's mind? How should the American presence be treated?
                            Ignored on the theory that the villagers dislike foreigners? Or perhaps
                            brought out in carefully controlled ways to show the presence of
                            American power to help defend the people against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>? How about more emphasis on economic
                            improvements bestowed by the Saigon Government, along lines of <persName corresp="#p_WCB1">Ben Wood</persName>'s paper on <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>'s achievements?<note n="2" xml:id="d197fn2">Not found.</note> In any case, <pb n="407" xml:id="pg_407" facs="0427"/>can policy lines be established to put
                            more emphasis on the positive, in the sense perhaps of a sort of frame
                            of reference for testing new projects?</p>
                        <p>3) To what extent do the various U.S. agencies now influence the content
                            of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> propaganda and in what specific
                            ways is this done?</p>
                        <p>In the case of <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>, there is close to
                            total U.S. control (except for a <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            veto) in such operations as the weekly newsreel, some 50 hours of weekly
                            radio programming, the Operation Sunrise newspaper, plus various other
                            areas which you can elaborate. My idea is that it would be useful for
                            the Committee to collect specifics on what all the U.S. agencies in
                            Vietnam are doing along these lines, and then to try to assess
                            effectiveness and target areas that are not being adequately
                            covered.</p>
                        <p>4) Finally, where and how can the U.S. increase its influence over the
                            content of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> propaganda, assuming this
                            is desirable?</p>
                        <p>As I see it, this would be a study primarily concerned with specific
                            situations and personalities within the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and with specific U.S. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> relationships where there are possibilities for
                            negotiating a greater U.S. voice, e.g. the proposed <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> effort to get the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to accept a stateside task force to
                            advise on a program of rural education (the Winfield fetter),<note n="3" xml:id="d197fn3">Not further identified.</note> or your suggestion
                            for a VOA advisor. My thought is that this kind of a go-round should
                            ultimately produce agreement on which agency should try to promote what
                            specific objectives vis-à-vis improvement of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> propaganda effort.</p>

                            <item>Report on Visit of Defoliant Technical Team to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>
                            </item>
                        </list>
                        <p>1. Colonel Ewell and I attended a briefing on 11 May by members of the
                            inter-departmental technical team of defoliant experts who just returned
                            from <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. The team head, Brigadier
                            General Delmore (<gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss>, <pb n="408" xml:id="pg_408" facs="0428"/>USA Chemical Corps) remained in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. Dr. Shaw of the Department of
                            Agriculture made the presentation, which summarized the group's formal
                            report. Also present were Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FLMV1">Forrestal</persName>, Dr. MacRae from Dr. Wiesner's office, and a
                            representative of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. The key conclusion of the group is that the chemicals will do the job
                            if properly applied. The C-123 aircraft is suitable, but the spraying
                            equipment is not. Better equipment, some alteration of technique,
                            particularly the use of a larger size droplet for better control and
                            spraying during the wet season where possible, is required.</p>
                        <p>3. All 21 areas covered by defoliant in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> were examined. On the basis of five physical and
                            operational criteria, the group report 70 per cent overall effectiveness
                            (ranging from 30-95 per cent) despite technical spraying deficiencies
                            and the fact the vegetation was sprayed during the adverse dormant
                            period. Previous reports of lower effectiveness are due to inspections
                            having been made too soon after spraying.</p>
                        <p>4. There was a lengthy discussion of the differing characteristics of
                            vegetation and the resulting interaction with chemicals. Major points
                            made:</p>
                        <p>a. Plants differ in their tolerance to herbicides and these differences
                            must be taken into account in planning vegetation control and evaluating
                            effects of chemicals. (The team's observation of chemical results was
                            much more optimistic than that received previously from the field. This
                            is due to a later look which, under the weather conditions prevailing at
                            the time of spraying, permitted fairer evaluation.)</p>
                        <p>b. The optimum combination of chemicals, spraying equipment, and
                            vegetation must be proved on the ground; there is need for more research
                            in tropical regions.</p>
                        <p>5. The team did not see or examine areas where food plants had been
                            treated with chemicals. Based on extensive research in the US, however,
                            the feasibility of killing all crops in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> with chemicals now available, at any time during the
                            plant's life cycle prior to the production of edible portions, is well
                            established. Commercial chemicals are available with which crops in
                            selected areas can be killed without damage to crops of the same kind in
                            nearby areas. Operational research to join the chemical to a halo for
                            spraying is necessary, particularly on the basis of experience in the
                            defoliation exercise.</p>
                        <p>6. In mid-April, prior to this briefing, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FLMV1">Forrestal</persName> received an interim evaluation of results from
                            Defense. It indicated a need for further technical evaluation before
                            resuming operational tests. Based on this, he recommended to the
                            President that experiments be conducted outside <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and further operational use should be predicated <pb n="409" xml:id="pg_409" facs="0429"/>on their prior success. The
                            President apparently concurred; the relevant papers are attached.<note n="2" xml:id="d198fn2">Not found attached, but see <ref target="#d160">Documents 160</ref> and <ref target="#d178">178</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>7. The Expert's report (described above) has indicated, since that time,
                            that there are only minor technical improvements required. Defense is
                            proceeding with tests to accomplish this in the US. ARPA estimates
                            completion in the next week to 10 days. The next step will be to obtain
                            target recommendations from Saigon and for Defense and State to come
                            forward to the President with new recommendations. The optimum spraying
                            season will occur during the June-September period.</p>
                        <p>You may wish to determine Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s intentions on this subject. The expert's
                            report suggests this could be a lucrative R&amp;D item, both for
                            defoliation and crop destruction.</p>

                                Cap St. Jacques, May 17, 1962</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The invitation to lunch was issued only 24 hours in advance and
                            presumably was a result of my remark to Minister <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Nguyen Dinh Thuan</persName> a few days earlier
                            that I hoped to renew my 1953-55 acquaintance with <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>. I was taken to Cap St. Jacques in
                            an <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> helicopter, accompanied by
                            Truong Buu Khanh, director of Vietnam Presse, who was the only other
                            person present during the interview and lunch. <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> told me he had come to Cap St.
                            Jacques earlier that morning for an inspection tour. He said it was the
                            third time he had been there in seven years.</p>
                        <pb n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0430"/>
                        <p>Altogether I spent 4-1/2 hours with the President. As compared with my
                            recollection of seven years ago, I found him remarkably unchanged
                            physically, but distinctly more confident (or uninformed?), relaxed and
                            sophisticated. He remembered me well (asked about Henry Luce's health)
                            and immediately promised to make arrangements when I said I hoped to
                            call on Brother <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_NK5">Khanh</persName> told me afterward that he had seldom seen
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> talk to a foreigner so
                            candidly.</p>
                        <p>The conversation (in French) ranged over everything from corn on the cob
                            (“one of the best things they have in America”) to the personality of Ho
                            Chi Minh (“he looks over your head when you're with him and does all the
                            talking; if you try to say something, he doesn't hear you”). The
                            President also talked knowingly for five minutes about Andre Malraux
                            after I presented him with a fancy, two-volume edition of Malraux'
                            “History of the American People” (in French) in the name of the U.S.
                            Mission to Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>My intention at the outset was to let the President guide the
                            conversation, to try to establish a rapport at this meeting, and to
                            leave any pitches until another occasion. <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> soon made it clear, however, that he was in a mood
                            for more give and take than that. The substantive results:</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Diem's personal image</hi>. During a discursive
                            recital by <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> on the importance
                            of the President keeping in touch with the people, I remarked that
                            Vietnam's new radio facilities now made it possible for him to reach
                            millions of his people at once, as against a few hundred at each
                            personal appearance. He said the new transmitters were tremendously
                            important but that a chief of state should not use the radio too often
                            because the people become bored. “Look what happened to Bao Dai,” he
                            said. I said Bao Dai was no leader and, in any case, had nothing to say.
                            I then suggested that he, <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>,
                            was personally a valuable weapon because the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> have no well-known leader and also because he has a
                            strong following among the villagers of Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>: “That's the same thing Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> says.” He went on to
                            complain that on the occasions when he has made radio speeches—citing
                            his recent May Day message specifically—the foreign press has taken no
                            notice. “It's only when people like Sihanouk spit in their faces that
                            they write about it,” he said.</p>
                        <p>I said that what counts is reaching his own people, much more than the
                            foreign press, that this is a time of deep crisis for his country and
                            the people needed reassurance. I told him about President Roosevelt's
                            fireside chats during World War II, how he so successfully appeared to
                            take the people into his confidence at a moment when their sons and
                            husbands were fighting and dying overseas, just as Vietnamese sons and
                            husbands are fighting and dying today. I said Roosevelt was a great
                            politician who understood how badly the people <pb n="411" xml:id="pg_411" facs="0431"/>wanted to know what was happening, what
                            their government was doing, what the problems were, and thus to feel
                            part of the team. I said that in this time of deep crisis in the cold
                            war Presidents <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and now
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> were both using the
                            same technique.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> listened attentively to all
                            this, then half shook his head, as though to be rid of an indigestible
                            thought. I said that <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> had a
                            10minute film of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> making one of his recent TV/radio talks to the
                            people and asked if he would like to see it. Without hesitation,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> said yes. Then he added
                            that the palace projector had broken down. I said we would bring one of
                            our projectors. <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> said
                            fine—and confirmed this again later as I was leaving.</p>
                        <p>(We will, of course, follow through on this as quickly as possible. Would
                            you like to join the act, perhaps by a formal query on when it would be
                            convenient for the President to see the film? Maybe we could combine
                            this with a showing of one or two of the newly completed task force
                            films for village audiences?)</p>
                        <p>My feeling was that <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> agreed to
                            see the film out of curiosity whether there just might be something to
                            this fireside chat business, not because he had been convinced. In any
                            case, he now returned to his apparent preoccupation with the
                            indifference of the foreign press to his speeches. He said he thought
                            this was the fault of his translators. He said he had long been trying
                            unsuccessfully to find competent Vietnamese-to-English and
                            French-to-English translators. (He added rather cryptically that “the
                            British” had found him a good English-to-Vietnamese translator.) I
                            suggested perhaps USIS could help and the President said fine.</p>
                        <p>(We will also, of course, pursue this forthwith. My immediate thought is
                            that perhaps we should try to place somebody who would remain—officially
                            and openly—on the <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> payroll and thus
                            possibly provide a channel for exercising some editorial influence on
                            content.)</p>
                        <p>At this point I felt that <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> was
                            so considerably interested in the problem of communicating that I could
                            risk an adventure. I asked if he had a good speech writer. He said he
                            had none at all, almost as though such a thing had never occurred to
                            him. I expressed surprise and said it was commonplace for chiefs of
                            state and many other top people all over the world to employ
                            professional writers, men who would listen to the boss's ideas and then
                            put them down in eloquent language. <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> said this was a good idea. I said perhaps we could
                            help find somebody. <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> said
                            fine. I said of course it should be a Vietnamese? <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>: “I don't know a man in Vietnam
                            who could do this.” I said: “You mean you would consider an American?”
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>: “Yes.” Then after a
                            moment's thought: “But of course it must be a man we know, with a good
                            background.” I said I would begin a search for the right man
                            immediately, including a query to Washington. He nodded, apparently <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412" facs="0432"/>undisturbed. I asked how to
                            pursue the matter and <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> said
                            that Thaun would handle it. He also reconfirmed all this as I was
                            leaving.</p>
                        <p>At the Colby cocktail party a few hours later, I ran into <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> and said I had discussed a number
                            of projects with the President, who had referred me to him to implement,
                            and that I would like to call on him within the next day or so.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> had already told him about “the
                            good conversation he had with you” and that we could get together next
                            week.</p>
                        <p>(Obviously there's a good possibility that <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s advisors will talk him out of all this, but we do
                            have an asset in the fact that <persName corresp="#p_NK5">Khanh</persName>, a relatively secondary figure, was present.) My
                            feeling is that we should follow through with all possible speed and try
                            to come up with a candidate by the middle of next week. You will know
                            best about the mechanics of the cable to Washington, but I can think of
                            several people who might be invited to make suggestions: <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> Deputy Director <persName corresp="#p_WDM1">Don Wilson</persName>, who worked with me here in
                            1954-55; … Bob Manning, Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs,
                            also a <hi rend="italic">Time-Life</hi> alumnus and my good friend.</p>
                        <p>One candidate who occurs to me immediately is Howie Simpson, presently
                            Assistant Press Attaché in Paris, who served several years (circa
                            1953-55) in Vietnam with <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>, who
                            subsequently wrote a good novel about Dienbienphu, “To a Quiet Valley,”
                            and who happens to be unhappy in his present position. He's an
                            unpolished type but intelligent, a fine writer, adequate in French,
                            thoroughly likeable. I'm sure some of <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s people would remember him and I think favorably.
                            He's an FSR-3 or 4.</p>
                        <p>(Assuming anything ever comes of this, there is the obvious problem of
                            the man's official position once he gets to Saigon. From our viewpoint,
                            I think it would be most effective for him to be attached to <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> or the embassy where he could keep in
                            close touch with policy considerations, with some kind of cover
                            assignment. But I suppose it's at least possible that <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> would resist any kind of direct
                            official tie with the U.S. and perhaps would even insist on our
                            assurance that the man would work wholly independently of officialdom.
                            This, I think, is a question we should consider at some length, and then
                            play by ear.)</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">The foreign press</hi>. Following <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s several unhappy references to
                            the foreign press, I invited him to discuss the problem. I'm sure you
                            have heard most of what he said: Sully is a French spy; displeasure at
                            the frequent reference to “American officials” as the source of
                            unfavorable stories; the correspondents' irresponsible dredging of what
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> calls “Radio Catinat”
                            (meaning the Rue Catinat bars) for information. My impression was that
                            he is no longer angry about his treatment in the foreign press, but
                            resigned to it, perplexed by it, and most reluctant to do anything about
                            it. He volunteered that most of his <pb n="413" xml:id="pg_413" facs="0433"/>ministers had “failed” to deal effectively with the
                            correspondents, and that Mme. <persName corresp="#p_TLX1">Nhu</persName> had shown a
                            “mauvaise charactere” in her bitter vindictiveness toward the
                            correspondents who have attacked her. He said he had tried to persuade
                            her to forget it, but unsuccessfully.</p>
                        <p>I told the President about my talk with <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> earlier this week<note n="2" xml:id="d199fn2">No
                                record of this meeting has been found.</note> and my commitment to
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> to make a study of the
                            correspondents' complaints and then to submit a paper to him about it. I
                            said I had not completed the paper but that it would particularly
                            emphasize one point: that a good many of the correspondents' complaints
                            would vanish if the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would make more
                            of an effort to provide information on military news. I said the
                            correspondents were primarily interested in progress of the war because
                            of the U.S. involvement, and suggested that they would probably pay less
                            attention to political affairs if military news were more easily
                            available. I said I thought the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            should draw a sharp distinction between political and military news and
                            set up new facilities exclusively for the latter, specifically:</p>
                        <p>1) A joint Vietnamese-American center, staffed by an officer from each
                            country, where newsmen could go for assistance on mechanical problems,
                            e.g., promoting transportation to operational areas. I said this would
                            eliminate the present practice of correspondents playing both parties
                            independently for favors, prevent inequities, and hopefully, tend to
                            damp down everything because there would at least be an official place
                            to register gripes. (I didn't say so, but my hope is that if we could
                            just achieve this degree of cooperation, the center might eventually
                            become a source of news as well as mechanical assistance.)</p>
                        <p>2) A daily <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> briefing on military
                            events, and establishment of a permanent PIO office with round-the-clock
                            duty officers in the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> Defense
                            Ministry. I said the present lack of an easily accessible official
                            source, for checking rumors if nothing else, was the main reason why the
                            newsmen listened so attentively to “Radio Catinat”. I said we on the
                            official U.S. side were as much interested in this as the correspondents
                            because it was our policy not to provide briefings and otherwise to
                            refer queries to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, with the
                            result that American newsmen were sore at us, too. I cited the case of
                            last weekend's wildly inaccurate <gloss target="#t_UPI1">UPI</gloss>
                            story about a battle with 300 <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> dead as
                            a horrible example of what happens when there is no easy way to check
                            rumors.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> was negative on both
                            pitches. He said the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> was already
                            doing all it could to provide things like transport to newsmen and
                            complained that he couldn't always be sure of a helicopter for himself
                            because of military demands. He said a daily briefing was impractical
                            because publication of such fresh news would help the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and that he had already appointed Dang
                            Duc Khoi to handle press queries. I said that the newsmen had to write
                            stories every day regardless of whether there was an official briefing
                            and that Khoi was a first-class officer, but <pb n="414" xml:id="pg_414" facs="0434"/>sometimes unavailable. <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> shrugged and clearly didn't want to pursue the
                            subject, so I dropped it. He did agree, however, that my forthcoming
                            paper for <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> might be
                            useful.</p>
                        <p>Altogether my feeling was that <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> realizes that his troubles with the press are
                            partly the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s fault, but that he's
                            profoundly suspicious of newsmen, and burned enough so he can't bring
                            himself to experiment.</p>

                            request), but he had no complaints about our performance at the moment.
                            He spoke highly of you. He ducked comment on U.S. policy in Laos, but
                            praised our reinforcements for Thailand, which he described as badly
                            infiltrated by Communists. He said he saw no need for expansion of the
                            present U.S. effort in Vietnam, except that he would like more
                            helicopter squadrons. I told him that Education Minister Trinh had said
                            Vietnam could use some 40 high school English teachers and asked if that
                            meant he was thinking about a Peace Corps operation. <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s facial expression showed a trace
                            of alarm as he said no, he didn't think the Peace Corps would be
                            suitable.</p>

                            Ledward Colonel Lac now working on “static defense plan.” Delta Plan
                            shelved in favor strategic hamlet program which is to have first
                            priority under direction <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh
                                Nhu</persName>. Hohler asked <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> about these difficulties, was told <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> had raised relation between Delta
                            Plan and strategic hamlet program at National Security Council meeting
                            and decision was taken to incorporate Delta Plan into strategic hamlet
                            program. Hohler also concerned because little contact between <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> mission and Colonel Y of

                        <p>If Delta Plan in fact shelved Department shares British concern. Believe
                            here that success in guerrilla conflict depends on rational plan applied
                            steadily over long haul. Believe you should very strongly encourage
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> stick with Delta Plan if they
                            wavering, second Hohler's efforts keep <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> on track.</p>
                        <p>From here it appears strategic hamlets essential part victory over <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> but concept of doubtful value if
                            abstracted from whole fabric Delta Plan. Particularly concerned that

                        <p>1. Obviously highly desirable find soonest some legal ground from which
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> could argue that introduction
                            military personnel and equipment not in violation Geneva Accords. As
                            Embassy Saigon observes, in absence some means of substantively handling
                            this question notification becomes self-conviction; equally, in absence
                            US legal case, Indian attitude toward US cause-and-effect argument tends
                            be that two wrongs do not add up to right. <persName corresp="#p_GYD1">Gundevia</persName> has already said once or twice that
                            cause-and-effect argument is admission of US violations.</p>
                        <p>2. Re fifth paragraph Saigon's 1471, from standpoint politico-military
                            considerations <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would undoubtedly be
                            seriously alarmed by results that could flow from acceptance replacement
                            argument, i.e., explicit sanction for virtually unlimited inflow of US
                            military personnel and equipment. Even a formal US unilateral
                            declaration of <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            <pb n="416" xml:id="pg_416" facs="0436"/>that if replacement argument
                            accepted we would use great restraint, as far as further build-up
                            concerned, might well not satisfy Indians as it would not impair our
                            legal right; in addition to which Embassy can appreciate need for
                            maintaining our freedom of action against future contingencies requiring
                            heavier build-up. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would undoubtedly
                            consider that its acceptance of replacement argument would radically
                            change balance of political forces in <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> context, with consequent serious results. Embassy
                            Saigon in better position than we to estimate practical dangers
                            involved; <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> officials have in past
                            mentioned risks of expulsion of Commission from <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> or Polish withdrawal. End point of process, as probably
                            viewed by Indians, would be complete breakdown of Geneva Accords and
                            irresistible demand for new international conference.</p>
                        <p>3. Further immediate factor that would weigh on minds <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would be that having just found US and
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in violation of Articles 16 and
                            17, reversal of this finding as result acceptance replacement argument
                            would lay <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> open to Communist charge
                            of capitulation under US pressure, a subject on which <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> more than usually sensitive at present
                            juncture.</p>
                        <p>4. Appears therefore that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would not
                            accept replacement argument if put to them in its present form. We
                            further assume <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would not wish broach
                            replacement argument to <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> unless some

                        <p>1. The Vietnam Task Force has developed an Emergency Medical Program for
                            Vietnam, the successful implementation of which is a matter of great
                            importance to the United States.</p>
                        <p>2. The Program calls for the building and equipping of surgeries, by
                                <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>/Vietnam to be staffed with
                            foreign medical teams. The United States is to supply 4 to 6 teams each
                            composed of 3 to 6 medical personnel. The Agency for International
                            Development will need assistance in the recruitment of from 4 to 12
                            doctors, 4 to 12 nurses, 4 to 6 medical technicians, and 4 to 6
                            anesthetists in the Program.</p>
                        <p>3. In order to discharge its responsibilities in implementing the
                            program, the Agency for International Development will need the
                            assistance of the Public Health Service in recruiting outside personnel
                            and in commissioning or assigning Public Health Service as required by
                            the Program.</p>
                        <p>4. The President directs the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare
                            to assist the Agency for International Development in every way possible
                            to implement the Emergency Medical Program for Vietnam, and specifically
                            to assist in staffing the medical teams required, either by assigning
                            Public Health Service personnel, or by assisting in recruiting the
                            necessary personnel.</p>
                        <p>5. The Public Health Service is requested to commission Public Health
                            Service officers for service in the Program, where necessary.</p>

                            Province (part of Delta Plan area) is already under execution and
                            appears to be progressing satisfactorily. However, operation commenced
                            before approval of Delta Plan and further operations in Delta area may
                            be organized differently. We pressing <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> for prompt decision and action.</p>

                            Yen Province in central Viet Nam under control of regimental commander
                            in area with province chief as his deputy. Military phase began May 8,
                            and seven battalion-sized operations have taken place since then.
                            Strategic hamlet construction (84 hamlets) has been initiated in most
                            secure areas of province, especially around provincial seat of Tuy Hoa.
                            Certain initial difficulties re personnel, piaster and material
                            requirements have been resolved or are on way to solution by US and

                        <p>Latest reports by US observers in area give encouraging picture of
                            progress and high morale those responsible for this operation.</p>
                        <p>3. Strategic hamlets program is in progress in every province and has
                            highest priority. Min Interior reports 1,600 strategic hamlets built to
                            date. Effectiveness and degree of planning and coordination varies
                            widely from province to province. At this juncture perhaps fairest
                            conclusion is that there is considerable momentum behind promising idea.
                            US objective is to encourage increased planning and coordination with
                            eye to defensibility and effectiveness. To this end specific US
                            assistance has been concentrated on operations meeting these objectives
                            and falling within areas of economic or strategic importance.</p>

                            Montagnards from mountain areas seeking <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> protection and support. Some 47,000 have been resettled
                            in Kontum, Pleiku, Darlac, and Quang Duc Provinces. Flow continues,
                            however, and possibly as many more are in great need of assistance. As
                            flight of Montagnards probably deprives <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> of important source of support in highlands, it is most

                            offensive. This in itself has improved public morale. There are,
                            however, many weaknesses in the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            administration: delays in decisions at the top, vying for position and
                            lack of cooperation among officials, some poor planning and more sloppy
                            execution, poor public relations (both at home and abroad). I think
                            these weaknesses <pb n="426" xml:id="pg_426" facs="0446"/>are gradually
                            being improved, but there is still a long way to go. On the whole, I
                            think US counsel and advice are becoming increasingly acceptable and
                            should produce further dividends.</p>

                            Delta. Lac said concept has been presented President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> but has not yet been approved. He
                            said he had been informed by Secretariat in Presidency that concept had
                            been referred to “group” for study but Lac professed ignorance as to who
                            this group is.</p>
                        <p>At Embassy officer's request Lac provided copy organizational chart
                            presented to <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> which will be

                        </p>
                        <p>Embassy officer asked Lac whether concept as presented to <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> included single commander at
                            division tactical zone level for military and civilian operations. Lac
                            said he had recommended to <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>
                            that this authority be given division commander with proviso that
                            central government (i.e. President) determine when military control in
                            given area will shift to civilian control.</p>
                        <p>Embassy officer asked Lac whether any operational plans for Delta area
                            had been developed as yet. He replied that until organizational concept
                            approved by <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> orders cannot be
                            issued for formation committees at various lower levels including
                            division tactical zone and plans cannot be requested from division
                            tactical zone until committees formed. He added that once concept
                            approved orders for formation committees can go out within two or three
                            days and plans should come up rapidly for approval. Embassy officer made
                            it clear that we need specific operational plans in order to determine
                            where we can bring our assistance to bear in counterinsurgency
                            operations.</p>

                            <pb n="427" xml:id="pg_427" facs="0447"/> Lac said that meanwhile he has
                            been made member of Inter-Ministerial Committee on Strategic Hamlets
                            (headed by <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>). Meeting is to be held at My
                                <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName> under
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>'s chairmanship May 24 to deal with Delta
                            provinces.</p>
                        <p> Lac said he plans recommend at this meeting that series of “defended
                            hamlets” be constructed along edge Plaine des Joncs for resettlement
                            inhabitants that area under <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> pressures
                            or control. If recommendation approved he said we would be requested to
                            provide assistance. Embassy officer pointed out this would appear to be
                            contrary to Delta Plan concept of restoring security gradually from more
                            secure to less secure areas and asked particularly whether there would
                            be adequate forces to defend series defended hamlets along edge Plaine
                            des Joncs. Lac understood reasons for this question and indicated it
                            would be raised at meeting in My <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName>.</p>
                        <p> Lac said he would also have to present to this meeting proposals which
                            had been made by province chiefs of Long An, Dinh Tuong and Vinh Long
                            for erection additional small defense posts. Lac indicated however he
                            did not think very much of this idea himself as there are already too
                            many small posts to defend. Embassy officer likewise said that he did
                            not particularly like this idea which had been presented about week ago
                            to Country Team Committee on Province Rehabilitation.</p>
                        <p> Lac also said that he planned urge at My <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName> meeting that province chiefs in area establish
                            specific plan of area priorities for strategic hamlet construction. He
                            said that <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> supports concept of priorities based
                            on Zones A, B and C—i.e. from more secure to less secure areas taking
                            into consideration population and communications routes and centers—but
                            province chiefs thus far building strategic hamlets helterskelter
                            fashion. Embassy officer strongly supported idea of area priorities for
                            strategic hamlets.</p>
                        <p> Lac agreed that there is essential difference between <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> Plan approach to pacification
                            which would give priorities to Delta provinces because security forces
                            not adequate to permit simultaneous pacification efforts all over
                            country and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s current approach
                            involving strategic hamlet construction in every province in
                            country.</p>

                        <p>I opened the conversation by asking <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> whether he could bring me up to date on the status
                            of the Delta Plan. We had heard, I said, that the Plan had been
                            “shelved”.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said he would give me a
                            “complete explanation”. He began by recalling that the Delta Plan had
                            been worked out by the British Advisory Mission in coordination with the
                            U.S. Mission. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> had
                            approved the Plan and issued a decree appointing Colonel Hoang Van Lac
                            as Commissioner for the Plan.<note n="2" xml:id="d205fn2">March 16 and
                                23, respectively.</note> At about the same time, the
                            Interministerial Committee on Strategic Hamlets was formed.<note n="3" xml:id="d205fn3">February 3.</note> It thus became necessary to
                            ascertain the relationship between the two programs (Strategic Hamlets
                            and Delta Plan) and those administering them. Therefore, <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said, after the appointment of
                            Lac, he asked the President, at a meeting (of the <gloss target="#t_NISC1">NISC</gloss>?) at which <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>
                            was present, (a) to define precisely Colonel Lac's authority and (b) to
                            make clear whether the Delta Plan would have first priority (presumably
                            within the Strategic Hamlets scheme). In the discussion of these points
                            with the President, it developed that, on the military side, Lac would
                            not be able to give orders to Division Commanders or to General
                            officers. (The implication was that this was because of his rank.)
                            Moreover, he would not be able to give orders to Province Chiefs.</p>
                        <p>As to whether the Delta Plan would have first priority, <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said that the President's
                            decision was in effect that it would not. The Strategic Hamlet Program
                            would go forward throughout the country. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> remarked wryly that the Program was to be
                            completed in six months.</p>
                        <p>In this situation, <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said, it
                            was decided that Lac should be made a member of the Strategic Hamlets
                            Committee and given responsibility for the construction of strategic
                            hamlets and defended hamlets in the Delta area. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said that this was logical
                            because the Delta Plan was a plan to establish such hamlets in the Delta
                            area. In fact, he could see nothing inconsistent between the Delta Plan
                            and the <pb n="429" xml:id="pg_429" facs="0449"/>Strategic Hamlets
                            Program. I remarked that strategic hamlets were a key feature of the
                            Delta Plan but an equally or more important feature of the Plan was the
                            closest coordination between civil and military authorities at every
                            echelon. The latter did not appear to me to be spelled out in the
                            Strategic Hamlets Program. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>
                            did not dispute this. In this connection, I asked whether Lac was likely
                            to get his organizational scheme (which provides for civil-military
                            coordination) approved. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> was
                            vague on this. He said that Lac had shown the President his chart but
                            had not given him a “full briefing” on it. I asked whether the Strategic
                            Hamlets Committee might be considering Lac's organizational plan.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> was vague on this also,
                            but I gathered that this might be the case.</p>
                        <p>Turning next to Lac's “plan” for constructing defended hamlets in Long
                            An, Binh Duong, and Vinh Long Provinces, roughly along the edge of the
                            Plaine des Joncs, <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said that
                            Ambassador Hohler had complained that this was a Maginot Line concept
                            tying down the regular forces. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said he had put this to Colonel Lac, whose reply
                            was that it was proposed to defend the defended hamlets with Civil Guard
                            and Self Defense Corps, not regulars. Regular forces would operate into
                            the Plaine des Joncs.</p>
                        <p>I remarked that this scheme for a defense line along the Plaine des Joncs
                            had been described to the U.S. Committee on Province Rehabilitation, but
                            not as a plan of operation, rather as the views of individual Province
                            Chiefs. I pressed <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> as to
                            whether the idea had been coordinated with the military authorities.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said eventually that
                            Lac had “discussed” it with the Commander of the 21st Division (who
                            liked it) and the Commander of the 7th Division (who did not like it).
                            In response to my question as to the views of III Corps, <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said that this was “just a
                            headquarters.”</p>
                        <p>I thanked <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> for the
                            information he had given me, but said it disturbed me. In the first
                            place, the absence of geographical priorities made it almost impossible
                            for the U.S. to plan its support for counterinsurgency operations.
                            Secondly, I was perhaps even more concerned at the apparent absence of
                            close coordination between civil and military. To leave the military out
                            of planning meant effectively to lose their support in execution. This,
                            I said, was to fight with one hand tied behind your back. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said that the military were
                            represented on the Strategic Hamlets Committee, but made no attempt
                            seriously to refute what I had said. (The Strategic Hamlets Committee,
                            according to Minister Luong, does not review the plans of the Province
                            Chief unless he makes a request for help from Saigon.)</p>
                        <p>After some further discussion of Operation Sunrise and Hai Yen II,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> asked if I did not
                            think “things were going well.” I said I did, that there was real
                            momentum behind the Strategic Hamlet Program which seemed to me a sound
                            concept. I thought, however, that planning <pb n="430" xml:id="pg_430" facs="0450"/>and coordination had to be imposed on the program for
                            constructing strategic hamlets. Otherwise, I feared that many hamlets in
                            exposed areas were going to be overrun. I was afraid that if this
                            happened the Program might be discredited in Viet-Nam and in the U.S.A.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> did not comment. When I
                            left, however, after discussing several other matters, <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> reverted to the earlier
                            discussion and said that he recognized the importance of priorities and
                            coordination. He asked me not to despair. I said that I never
                            despaired.</p>

                        <p>I have talked to <persName corresp="#p_CSJ3">Sterling Cottrell</persName>
                            in the State Department about the Bigart article in this morning's <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Essentially the article discloses nothing new other than the fact that
                            Bigart has discovered the dimensions of American effort with President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> which has been going on
                            for some time. For several months now we have been trying to persuade
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> to permit Americans
                                (<gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>) to dispense economic and military assistance directly
                            in certain of the most pressed provinces on an emergency basis.</p>
                        <p>Although <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> has refused to
                            sanction this sort of operation generally because he feels it would
                            undermine his political control, he has permitted some direct allocation
                            of resources by Americans on a project-by-project basis in connection
                            with Operation Sunrise and counter-insurgency activities in one of the
                            provinces.</p>
                        <p>This is, however, only one of a number of programs suggested by us with
                            which <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> has been slow to
                            cooperate. He has not dug in his heels but is putting on the brakes. He
                            has, for example, reluctantly permitted the assignment of American
                            advisers to the province chiefs but has not in every case allowed them
                            to occupy the same buildings. <pb n="431" xml:id="pg_431" facs="0451"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName> feels that, at this
                            point, <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s resistance to most
                            of our proposals is not so great as to require more forceful pressures
                            from us; but he, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> are watching the situation closely.</p>
                        <p>There is, however, one problem which may come up soon where we may have
                            to take a tougher attitude toward <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>. This is the problem of generating sufficient local
                            currency (piasters) to finance increased local cost of maintaining the
                            para-military forces and other counter-insurgency operations.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has argued that it needs more
                            gold or hard currency to back up any increase in piaster circulation. We
                            have taken the position that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            should borrow from the central bank and to the extent that inflation
                            became a problem, we would undertake an increased commodity import
                            program.</p>
                        <p>Apparently last year we caved in on a similar request and provided the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> with gold or dollar reserve.
                            Both State and the Aid Agency do not favor a repetition of this
                            approach.</p>
                        <p>My own very strong feeling is that cash grants to support the
                            international convertibility of local currency is idiotic and dangerous.
                            This is precisely what we have been doing in Laos with the painful
                            results we know so well. I see absolutely no justification for
                            subsidizing the convertibility of piasters, since without strict and
                            effective exchange control, all this does is to increase the importation
                            of nonessentials and does nothing to help get on with the problem of
                            defeating the Viet Cong. If the money supply in Vietnam exceeds the
                            supply of essential commodities, then we should provide the commodities
                            to match the money supply, not free dollars. I sense from a few
                            conversations with the President that he is inclined to agree with this
                            position.</p>

                            <item>Laos and North Viet-Nam</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The possibility of putting US combat forces into Laos raises this
                            question: Is our objective (a) a split Laos; or (b) a unified Laos from
                            which the North Vietnamese are made to withdraw and from which the
                            Chinese Communists are barred? The issue has been obscured because (a)
                            has been regarded as a “tough” policy; (b), as a “soft” policy. I
                            believe the opposite is the case.</p>
                        <p>If our objective is (a), it probably can be attained if we move
                            sufficient US forces into the area and if we are prepared to have them
                            stay there indefinitely. Our movement would face the Communists with a
                            choice. They could either accept the split, de facto or de jure;
                            consolidate on their side of the line, probably introducing Chinese
                            Communists as well as North Vietnamese forces; and then look forward to
                            a gradual extension of their power in Laos by indirect aggression which
                            the long lines of demarcation and the nature of the terrain would make
                            thoroughly possible. From their point of view the split would be a great
                            advance over the situation in 1954 when the Communists were merely
                            granted two Lao provinces in the north. Moreover, it would be very
                            difficult for us under the new de facto situation to argue that it was
                            inappropriate for the Vietminh and the Chinese Communists to come into
                            the north if we remained in the south.</p>
                        <p>On the whole I believe this is the outcome Ho, Mao, and Souphanouvong
                            want.</p>
                        <p>My hunch is that the Soviet Union has, on the whole, opposed a split
                            because it raised the possibility of escalation in which their prestige
                            would be involved and because it would push North Viet-Nam closer to
                            Peiping. On the other hand, the attractive situation on the ground and
                            the low costs we have imposed on the North Vietnamese for their
                            aggression in northern Laos, have made it difficult for Moscow to
                            persuade Ho and Souphanouvong honestly to back a neutral, independent
                            Laos.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, if we set as our objective a Laos from which both
                            North Vietnamese and Chinese Communist troops are excluded, I suspect we
                            shall have to raise the costs to the Communists beyond the point of
                            present defensive planning. We should have to take the view that our
                            policy in Southeast Asia is to get the North Vietnamese <pb n="433" xml:id="pg_433" facs="0453"/>forces back to North Viet-Nam; and to
                            keep the Chinese Communists from using the road into Laos they are now
                            building; and we would have to be prepared to impose on North Viet-Nam
                            sufficient costs to make a neutral, independent Laos the most attractive
                            realistic alternative open to the Communists.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, therefore, if aggression is resumed in Laos by the
                            Communists, I urge that we consider the following track:</p>
                        <p>1. We restate our objectives in both South Viet-Nam and Laos as,
                            essentially, a return to the Geneva Accords of 1954 (including
                            explicitly a neutral, independent Laos).</p>
                        <p>2. We surface the crucial role of the North Vietnamese forces in Laos, as
                            well as in South Viet-Nam, stating publicly for the first time what is
                            true; namely, that the aggression in Laos is essentially Ho's rather
                            than Souphanouvong's.</p>
                        <p>3. We propose to inflict selective damage on North Viet-Nam for its
                            aggression beyond its borders until that aggression ceases. I do not
                            have in mind here massive bombing of Hanoi. I do have in mind highly
                            selective attack on transport and power facilities, by precision
                            methods, which are now within our capability, plus some mining of
                            Haiphong harbor.</p>
                        <p>4. In this setting we would move vigorously into Laos and immediately
                            take measures to close off the infiltration through Laos into South
                            Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>It is my assessment that, unless we are prepared to raise the ante in
                            this way, the Communists will judge—and judge correctly—that their
                            present salami tactics in Southeast Asia will succeed. If, however, we
                            are prepared to take the risks of this wholly legitimate act against
                            North Viet-Nam—which has no right to have its soldiers south of the 1
                            7th parallel or in Laos—we have a fair chance of giving <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> a legitimate argument for
                            going forward on the track which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> and Mr. Pushkin discussed in Geneva.</p>
                        <p>There are, of course, risks in this as in any other action designed to
                            stop aggression; and we should be prepared for any level of escalation
                            that the Communists may choose in response. On the other hand, the
                            internal situation in both North Viet-Nam and Communist China, plus the
                            relatively favorable balance of nuclear strength between the US and the
                            Soviet Union, and the Sino-Soviet split, make this as good a time to
                            face this risk as any we are likely to confront in this decade.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I believe our relatively passive policy in both Viet-Nam and
                            Laos has weakened the hand of those in Moscow—including Mr. Pushkin—who
                            wish to see the situation in Southeast Asia defused.</p>
                        <p>In short, I believe a bolder policy than that now envisaged has a chance
                            of fending off an outcome we have long sought to avoid; that is, an
                            indefinitely prolonged US commitment to hold with US troops the Mekong
                            Valley and southern Laos.</p>

                        <p>Summary Evaluation. In terms revival strength <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> versus Viet Cong during week since last report, I see
                            no significant internal factors indicating any substantial change.
                            International recognition of importance Vietnam's struggle against
                            Communist subversion continues to increase (Australian ForMin's
                            forthright support and upcoming <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>
                            action), and has beneficial effect on morale here. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> planning, organization and execution of
                            plans continues to be spotty. Despite some delays and setbacks, I think
                            improvement can be noted. It goes without saying that outcome in Laos
                            will have very great effect on chances of ultimate success here.</p>

                            support of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> memorandum. In brief, it
                            predicts a deficit in central government budget for CY 1962 of 4.8
                            billion piasters which attributed as follows: 1.7 billion to military
                            budget; 3.17 billion to civil and paramilitary forces budget. Argument
                            is made that deficit arises primarily because of failure to dispose of
                            US economic aid and difficulties of importers to use such aid because of
                            price factors resulting from limited world wide procurement requirements
                            under USAID. Memorandum suggests a $25 million cash grant (presumption
                            is that such a cash grant would have no limited procurement strings
                            attached to it). Of this $25 million (to be disposed of within this
                            calendar year) 5 million dollars would be spent for freight payments on
                            foreign flag vessels, 12 million dollars for industrial machinery
                            imports, and 8 million dollars for a variety of raw materials of which
                            major item is fertilizer.</p>
                        <p>Two <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> written communications, plus
                            several informal discussions, point to another serious negotiation with
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> on financial matters. We have
                            given much thought to position we should take. Before describing effect
                            of present economic and financial situation <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> on counter insurgency effort and making recommendations
                            thereon, several factual errors in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            memorandum of May 9 need correction:</p>
                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s balance of gold and dollar
                            reserves as of March 31, 1962 was 164,450,000 dollars (figures given in
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s memorandum failed to include
                            about 20 million dollars in gold).</p>
                        <p>2. Average yield on US-financed imports is approximately 74 piasters per
                            dollar rather than 82.</p>
                        <p>3. The contention that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has carried
                            out all financial measures recommended in <persName corresp="#p_SEA2">Staley</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_VQT1">Thuc</persName>
                                Report<note n="5" xml:id="d210fn5">See the letter transmitting the

                                    Document 93</ref>.</note> is exaggerated. While the 5/7 tax on
                            foreign exchange (25 piasters per dollar) and revised scale of customs
                            duties have been beneficial steps, there still remains much that can and
                            should be done by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to increase its
                            revenues. Revenues from taxes on real estate and income, for example,
                            are up 16 per cent over last year, but should be considerably higher.
                            (While rate of 60 piasters per dollar, plus customs duties, is not as
                            high as it should be: we do not think time is right to press for another
                            increase in foreign exchange taxes. While this should be long range
                            objective, present business, political, and psychological conditions
                            here make it inadvisable to press for it now.) <pb n="439" xml:id="pg_439" facs="0459"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has this year, for first time, been
                            confronted with necessity of major deficit financing. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> estimates a deficit of approximately
                            4.8 billion piasters (on a total budget of 23.7) for this year. (Only
                            earlier estimate was in the order of 3.5 billion piasters.)</p>
                        <p>Two issues are presented: (1) concerning the level of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> foreign exchange holdings, and (2) the
                            necessity to finance the piaster budget to wage a successful campaign on
                            all fronts.</p>
                        <p>With regard to question of maintaining about $200 million level of
                            foreign exchange reserves, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s
                            position is that, in adopting <persName corresp="#p_SEA2">Staley</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_VQT1">Thuc</persName>
                            Report, US and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> both agreed that such
                            level should be maintained by mutual measures. We have already explained
                            to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> that such factors as increase in
                            list of US-financed imports (petroleum, sugar, cotton yarn—23 million
                            dollars), dollar expenditures by US forces for military construction
                            (15-20 million dollars), probable revival of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> rice exports during second half of 1962 (5 million
                            dollars) will reverse recent trend and probably restore <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s reserves to region of 200 million
                            dollars by mid-1963. This assumes that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will not repeat its unusually high drawings on foreign
                            exchange reserves as during last half of 1961. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> foreign exchange position is not, then, an acute
                            economic or financial problem.</p>
                        <p>It is, however, a real psychological and political factor on <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> side.</p>
                        <p>With respect to piaster shortage, there will doubtless be a requirement
                            for major deficit financing this year. Our original US-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> calculations were that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> budget of 23.4 billion piasters could
                            be financed by: <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s own revenues of 11
                            billion piasters; US imports amounting to 165 million dollars, including
                            PL 480 (11 billion piasters); bank borrowing of 1.5 billion piasters.
                            However, failure <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> economy to absorb
                            more than approximately 135 million dollars US imports has resulted in
                            shortfall govt income. Several factors are responsible for this
                            situation, chief of which are sharp rise in prices resulting from
                            monetary reform, on top of price increases resulting from limited world
                            wide procurement policy, and insecurity in countryside.</p>
                        <p>We are not certain whether <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s
                            conclusions that removal of limited world wide procurement restrictions
                            on aid dollars would in fact result in sales of an additional 25 million
                            dollars of foreign exchange. It would be helpful if Washington could
                            give exemptions on certain selected commodities this year to test <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> assumption. This, we think, could be
                            done without creating a precedent for other countries, in light of
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>'s emergency situation.</p>
                        <p>We recognize that in purely economic and financial terms, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> can and probably should proceed to
                            solve their piaster shortage through central bank financing of the
                            budget deficit, which could <pb n="440" xml:id="pg_440" facs="0460"/>probably be done without major price dislocations because of current
                            slow-down in business activity and reduction in velocity of currency in
                            circulation.</p>
                        <p>We not unaware of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> proclivity to pass
                            the buck to Uncle Sam, but we do not believe that standing pat in
                            present situation will be conducive to winning the struggle here,
                            despite the lack of an airtight economic rationale on <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> side. The US has made a very large
                            investment of resources, manpower and prestige in this struggle. We need
                            now a negotiating position from which to gain the largest possible
                            contribution by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> from its own
                            resources which will be both sound and timely and will keep up the
                            momentum. If we do not come up with such a proposal, believe result will
                            be either a slowdown or an effort to “sweat it out of the peasants”
                            (e.g., failure to pay for labor, supplies, care for Montagnard
                            population, civic action, etc.).</p>
                        <p>In addition to regularly budgeted items, there constantly arise in this
                            fluid situation special requirements and special opportunities,
                            requiring program changes or additional funds. For example, unforeseen
                            requirements for strategic hamlets, “clear and hold” operations, relief
                            and resettlement of many thousands of Montagnards who have flocked to
                            government for protection, military civic action programs, etc., all
                            present additional piaster requirements. They are tremendously important
                            in counter-insurgency effort. US policy aims at speed-up in getting
                            necessary supplies and incentives to Vietnamese peasants in order to
                            enable them to defend themselves. We have sought a method to apply
                            counterpart funds directly to rural rehabilitation projects. In the
                            overall shortage of piasters for budgeted requirements, however, this
                            has been difficult to achieve as it involves robbing Peter to pay Paul,
                            although we have succeeded in getting one such agreement
                            implemented.</p>
                        <p>Our considered recommendations for meeting current problem are as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>1. A waiver of limited worldwide procurement for industrial machinery.
                            This is a category in which <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> claims
                            that imports have fallen because of price factors stemming from limited
                            worldwide procurement, particularly for small orders which are typical
                            here. It is a fact that licensing activity for industrial machinery has
                            dropped from an average annual rate of about 20 million dollars a year
                            to an annual rate of 6 million during 1962. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> estimates that an additional 12 million dollars of
                            industrial machinery would be imported this year under conditions of
                            unlimited worldwide US-financed procurement. While we are not certain
                            that this would in fact result, we believe it desirable to test the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s assumption, and we believe
                            this could be done without setting a precedent in view of the situation
                            of active insurgency prevailing here.</p>
                        <p>2. Purchase from Viet Nam's National Bank approximately 730 million
                            piasters for US direct use (as agreed with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>) for counterinsurgency operations where timely action
                            is vital. This would produce a <pb n="441" xml:id="pg_441" facs="0461"/>piaster fund enabling US to take direct action, where necessary, in
                            order to apply prompt aid measures in US interests, and would, of
                            course, additionally contribute 10 million dollars to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s foreign exchange reserves. These
                            funds would be from allotments currently available to <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> in Saigon—i.e., this would not be
                            additional aid to that already made availa61e by Washington. We consider
                            this a justified extraordinary action for this year. En the first
                            instance, when we formulated the current year's budget, the full measure
                            of the cost of the counterinsurgency effort was not foreseen; thus
                            adequate provision was not made for screening out other items of
                            expense. Secondly, the fall-off in demand for imports has served to
                            blunt the anticipated increase in revenues deriving from import duties.
                            If this proposal is approved, we will make a strong point of the fact
                            that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> cannot count on this kind
                            of action being repeated in future years.</p>
                        <p>3. In return, we would require an understanding from the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to finance from their own resources the
                            remainder of the central government budgetary funds. We would urge
                            measures to increase internal taxes, both assessments and collections,
                            particularly on real estate and income. (The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> record in this respect is improving—by increase of 16
                            per cent during this year—and we have reason to believe that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> intends to press forward in this
                            field.) Deficit financing would obviously be the way to make up the
                            difference, and we would require a firm undertaking from <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to do so.</p>

                                <ref target="#d210">Document 210</ref>.</note> gives our considered
                            recommendations for breaking local currency bottleneck which is
                            beginning to impede total counter-insurgency effort in Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>In summary, position is as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. Original <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> budget for CY 1962 has
                            been increased and will probably go higher if <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is to do the things “we and they” think necessary to
                            win counter-insurgency.</p>
                        <pb n="442" xml:id="pg_442" facs="0462"/>
                        <p>2. A shortfall in estimated absorptive capacity of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> economy has developed, to extent of
                            approximately $30 from original estimate of $165 million of US-financed
                            imports for CY 1962.</p>
                        <p>3. As result of these and other factors, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is faced with budget deficit substantially greater than
                            that anticipated at time adoption <persName corresp="#p_SEA2">Staley</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_VQT1">Thuc</persName>
                            report. There is developing a shortage of piasters despite available US
                            commercial aid.</p>
                        <p>4. In this situation, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is reluctant
                            and slow to finance special counter-insurgency measures, including
                            targets of opportunity, which are tremendously important (e.g. care and
                            feeding of Montagnards who are coming over in increasing numbers,
                            adequate provision for resettled people, pay for work on strategic
                            hamlets, pay for newly elected village officials).</p>
                        <p>5. While a good economic argument can, and has, been made that deficit
                            financing by GVN (borrowing from National Bank) is way to meet problem,
                            plain fact is that this will probably not be done in sufficient
                            amount—or done soon enough—to keep momentum in civic-social-economic
                            actions in “clear and hold” operations, rural rehabilitation, and
                            Strategic Hamlet Programs.</p>
                        <p>6. We propose to meet the problem by a combination of orthodox and
                            unorthodox means—as set forth in last paragraphs <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1564.</p>
                        <p>7. Proposals do not require an increase in the total amount of US
                            economic aid already approved for Viet-Nam for FY 1962.</p>
                        <p>8. Would greatly appreciate your personal consideration of our
                            proposals.</p>

                        <p>b. Does urgency situation require FY 62 funds in June (which would

                            probably not precisely known for several months, could final

                            effect?</p>
                        <p>c. Could a reduction in rate of counterpart deposit on limited number key
                            U.S. source commodities effectively substitute for waiver of limited
                            worldwide procurement by putting cost of U.S. source items to VN
                            consumer on parity with procurement from presently excluded sources such
                            as Japan? Reduction counterpart deposit is corollary measure envisaged
                            for certain cases in U.S. policy on limited worldwide procurement. Would

                            finance from own resources? Would closer joint budgetary review on
                            continuing basis be necessary to assure <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> not deferring expenditures which we regard as
                            important?</p>
                        <p>4. While we sure you keenly aware factors in following paras, your

                        <p>5. We hopeful that reftel concessions, if made, would lead to increased
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> assumption its own financial
                            responsibility. There is Washington concern lest extraordinary U.S. aid
                            measures create substantial disincentives for <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to pursue the social, economic and fiscal measures
                            sought by the U.S. which also very much a part of counter-insurgency,
                            the lack of which in longer run might create pressures or disorder
                            counter to our counter-insurgency efforts. Illustrative concerns
                            are:</p>
                        <p>a. Understand war burden already falls most heavily on rural populace
                            while richer urban groups contributing relatively little. Better tax
                            administration could help shift burden.</p>
                        <p>b. Understand current piaster shortage not only result of shortfall of
                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>-financed imports below $165
                            million (which U.S. expected when that figure set as target), but also
                            results from shortfall tax collection which appears be actually
                            declining despite <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> pronouncements
                            increased tax rates. Request comment on measures <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> might be induced undertake.</p>
                        <p>c. Feel budget gap probably even larger next year due limited absorptive
                            capacity imports and counterpart generation which expanding domestic
                            industry may reduce further. At same time, counterinsurgency budget
                            costs likely increase sharply. What is outlook for more specific <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> action help fill gap?</p>
                        <p>6. As US making strong play get more aid to VN from other countries (see
                            Circular Aidto X-552<note n="4" xml:id="d212fn4">Dated June 5, not

                            worldwide procurement undercut these efforts. Realistically, impact of
                            any such other aid arrangements probably not realizable until next year.

                            These courses of action were provided by the Departments of State and
                            Defense.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Estimate</p>
                        <p>A. <hi rend="italic"> US air attacks against Communist supply bases in
                                Laos and against the Laotian parts of the main overland supply
                                routes from North Vietnam.</hi> This course of action might be taken
                            in connection with or subsequent to occupation of the major Mekong River
                            areas of Laos by 8,000-10,000 US troops supported by Thai forces.</p>
                        <p>1. The Communists would almost certainly conclude that the US was
                            preparing for extensive military operations in Laos, particularly if
                            reinforcements and supplies were being built up in Thailand. They <pb n="446" xml:id="pg_446" facs="0466"/>would attempt to cope with the
                            US air attacks by both passive and active means and would maintain their
                            forces in the areas of Laos they now control. Therefore, it seems likely
                            that North Vietnamese antiaircraft units in Laos would be reinforced. In
                            addition, small numbers of fighter aircraft, flown by Chinese Communist
                            and possibly Soviet pilots, perhaps in the guise of North Vietnamese,
                            probably would be introduced into North Vietnamese airfields. The Soviet
                            airlift would almost certainly continue as feasible. To the extent of
                            their limited capabilities, Communist aircraft would probably attempt
                            some retaliatory action against US positions in Laos. However, as long
                            as the US air attacks were confined to Laos, the Communists would almost
                            certainly not extend their own air operations beyond the Laotian
                            borders.</p>
                        <p>2. We believe that the Communist ground forces would probably intensify
                            the actions we have already estimated they would take in response to the
                            US occupation of the Mekong River valley areas: they would probably
                            deploy to confine the areas under US control and harass US outposts,
                            patrols, and lines of communications. North Vietnamese reinforcements
                            would almost certainly be introduced. The Chinese Communists would
                            reinforce their border garrisons and some forces might enter northern
                            Laos. Moscow and Peiping would almost certainly increase their logistics
                            support to North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>3. At the same time the Communists would be concerned to keep the
                            conflict from spreading beyond Laos, and would take vigorous political
                            action, including intensified propaganda efforts, to obtain a cessation
                            of hostilities and the resumption of negotiations.</p>
                        <p>B. <hi rend="italic"> US air attacks against North Vietnam.</hi> The US
                            air attacks would be extended to include the North Vietnamese ends of
                            the main supply routes into Laos, but not the principal population
                            centers such as Hanoi. This course of action might be taken as part of a
                            US offensive involving 45,000 US troops to occupy the panhandle area of
                            Laos or might be undertaken in connection with the lesser action
                            involving the occupation of the Mekong River valley only.</p>
                        <p>4. Attacks on North Vietnam territory would, in the Communist view, mark
                            a major turning point in the situation. The Soviets and Chinese would
                            declare their full support for Hanoi. In an immediate effort to obtain a
                            cessation of the US attacks, they would orchestrate their political,
                            diplomatic, and propaganda moves in the UN and elsewhere against what
                            they would proclaim was an act of outright aggression.</p>
                        <p>5. Peiping and Moscow would almost certainly introduce air support to
                            protect North Vietnamese territory. The chances of the introduction of
                            Chinese Communist troops into Laos would increase significantly, but we
                            do not believe that they would consider it necessary to introduce them
                            into North Vietnam at this stage. The Communists would be concerned to
                            keep hostilities from spreading and, initially, <pb n="447" xml:id="pg_447" facs="0467"/>they would confine their action to the
                            defense of North Vietnam. However, if the US attacks were intense and
                            sustained, and particularly if they were associated with a US investment
                            of the Laotian panhandle, the Communists would be likely to regard them
                            as a forerunner of a general military offensive against North Vietnam.
                            Under these circumstances, they would almost certainly attempt to extend
                            their air attacks to include bases in Thailand and possibly in South
                            Vietnam and US carriers. We do not believe that there would be
                            significant differences between Moscow and Peiping insofar as the
                            question of coming to the aid of Hanoi is concerned.</p>
                        <p>C. <hi rend="italic">Amphibious Operations Against North Vietnam.</hi>
                            This situation assumes a division-strength landing in the Vinh area
                            followed by a drive west to the Laos border to link up with US forces in
                            Laos. This course of action would be undertaken in connection with a US
                            offensive involving 45,000 US troops to occupy the panhandle area of
                            Laos.</p>
                        <p>6. Open invasion of North Vietnam would be considered by the Communist
                            Bloc as a direct challenge to the integrity of the North Vietnamese
                            regime and as a threat to the security of Communist China. Hanoi would
                            take speedy and vigorous action to repel the invasion.<note n="4" xml:id="d213fn4">The North Vietnamese Army consists of 280,000
                                regular troops supported by 100,000 militia. [Footnote in the source
                                text.]</note> Communist China would almost certainly provide
                            additional ground forces if they were needed. The Bloc would launch a
                            violent propaganda campaign, warning of the danger of nuclear war, in an
                            effort to obtain US withdrawal under international pressure and
                            condemnation. If the US was undeterred and the invasion made headway, US
                            ground and naval units in the immediate area would almost certainly be
                            attacked by Communist air elements, perhaps under the guise of a North
                            Vietnamese air force. In addition, it is possible that Communist
                            submarines would be brought to bear. Supply and operational bases in
                            Laos, South Vietnam, and Thailand would probably be attacked by
                            Communist air forces. The Communists would be highly unlikely to take
                            the initiative to resort to nuclear weapons at this level of US
                            action.</p>

                            focused public and Congressional attention on our ultimate aims in
                            Southeast Asia. The second is the apparent Laos settlement which now
                            offers us an excellent opportunity for a positive clarification of our
                            over-all political objectives.</p>
                        <p>The military decisions we have made thus far in Vietnam and Thailand and
                            our contingency planning for Laos have been forced on us by events.
                            Although the necessity for these decisions is to be regretted, the
                            arguments for them at each juncture have been compelling.</p>
                        <p>However, our step-by-step military response has not been accompanied by a
                            comparable effort to think through our ultimate political aims for
                            Southeast Asia as a whole. As long as we lack a political “grand design”
                            for Southeast Asia, the initiative will continue to rest with our
                            adversaries and with our allies and camp followers, whose parochial
                            views often ignore the global forces with which American policy must
                            contend.</p>
                        <p>As matters now stand, we may find ourselves forced to choose between an
                            escalating war or a humiliating retreat in an area where the strategic
                            conditions are disadvantageous to us and where direct U.S. military
                            participation would be roundly denounced by domestic critics as “another
                            Democratic war.”</p>
                        <p>If in the meantime we have failed to go beyond Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>'s famous “falling dominoes”
                            analogy to explain our political objectives in Southeast Asia, we may
                            find ourselves increasingly the captive of events with unpredictable
                            results both at home and abroad.</p>

                        <p>The historical parallels are impressive and disturbing. Leaders of great
                            nations have often found themselves pressed by a succession of events,
                            each non-decisive in itself, into a position which they would not
                            conceivably have chosen and from which there was no honorable avenue of
                            retreat.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">The Guns of August</hi> overflows with pertinent
                            examples from World War I. In World War II, caught among the differing
                            theories of Henry Morgenthau, Robert Taft, Henry Wallace, Stalin and
                            Churchill, we found it impossible to agree on the kind of post-war
                            Europe for which we were fighting. One by-product is the present ugly
                            dilemma of Berlin.</p>
                        <p>In his discussion of the Korean War, Dick Neustadt has analyzed the
                            process of “non-decision” which resulted in our crossing of the 38th
                            Parallel, our march to the Yalu, and our catastrophic rout by the
                            Chinese.</p>
                        <p>As Neustadt and others have pointed out, our inability to agree on our
                                <hi rend="italic">political</hi> objectives for Korea as a whole
                            resulted in an unsatisfactory truce at the 38th Parallel two and
                            one-half years—and many thousands of lives—after the Inchon landings
                            when precisely the same settlement could have been achieved on our terms
                            in an atmosphere of dignity and success.</p>
                        <p>During this period the French in Southeast Asia were also in the midst of
                            a war with no clear definition of the broad political and economic aims
                            which the fighting was designed to achieve.</p>
                        <p>For domestic political reasons, the French Government refused to spell
                            out their willingness to grant freedom to the three nations of
                            Indo-China once the struggle against the Communists had been won.</p>
                        <p>As a result, with nearly the entire population against them, the French
                            Army suffered casualties that totaled more than 90,000, with money costs
                            that exceeded all the aid we gave France under the Marshall Plan, to
                            which we added $3 billion in U.S. equipment. Ten years later we are
                            still paying for this debacle.</p>
                        <p>I believe that we may now stand at a comparable threshold of decision. In
                            Southeast Asia U.S. forces are involved in operations of uncertain
                            dimensions. This involvement is taking place in a political framework
                            which is unclear to our allies, our adversaries, the people of Southeast
                            Asia, the American public, and the Congress.</p>
                        <p>The greatest danger may lie in the profound confusion that exists among
                            the 200 million Southeast Asians who are most directly concerned. Most
                            young anti-Communist Vietnamese, Cambodians, Laos [<hi rend="italic">Laotians</hi>], Burmese, Malayans and Indonesians now tend to think
                            of the U.S. in terms of the massive military supplies which we sent the
                            French “colonialists” in the early 1950's, … and of our support for
                            Sarit, <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_PN3">Phoumi</persName> and Chiang Kai-shek, none of
                            whom can be said to reflect the “New Frontier” in Asia.</p>
                        <pb n="450" xml:id="pg_450" facs="0470"/>
                        <p>It is essential that we present ourselves in a fresh and affirmative
                            role. This requires <hi rend="italic">a governmental decision, followed
                                by a public statement understandable both at home and abroad, in
                                which we spell out our objectives for Southeast Asia as a
                            whole</hi>.</p>
                        <p>In June 1947 General Marshall dramatically outlined our economic and
                            political aims for Europe. In 1961 you described through the Alliance
                            for Progress what we are seeking to achieve in Latin America. In my
                            opinion, the time is at hand for a similar statement in regard to
                            Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>Here, as elsewhere in the world, what we want for the people of the
                            region is almost precisely what the people want for themselves: <hi rend="italic">guaranteed national independence, more rapid economic
                                development, and maximum freedom of choice within their own cultures
                                and religions</hi>.</p>
                        <p>These objectives not only coincide with our own interests; they are
                            wholly compatible with our present undertakings. By spelling them out as
                                <hi rend="italic">American</hi> objectives in Southeast Asia, we can
                            provide a compelling rationale for whatever future action—military,
                            political or economic—we may be required to take in the region.</p>
                        <p>Such a clarification by you would be immediately reassuring to the
                            politically sophisticated people in both neutral and aligned states of
                            the region.</p>
                        <p>It would firmly identify the United States Government and people with
                            peace, development, and the increasing regional unity which offers the
                            most compelling alternative to Communist divisiveness and
                            fragmentation.</p>
                        <p>It would give American military, political and economic operations in
                            Southeast Asia the affirmative, understandable, appealing purpose which
                            has been largely lacking since the days of Roosevelt.</p>
                        <p>It would also give us a clear initiative in dealing with our Communist
                            adversaries, while encouraging whatever elements within the USSR may
                            desire stabilization and neutralization of the region, and removing any
                            valid excuse for Chinese Communist aggression based on a
                            misunderstanding of our objectives.</p>
                        <p>I have outlined the kind of proposal that I have in mind in a rough draft
                            of a speech, to be made by you, which I am attaching to this
                                memorandum.<note n="5" xml:id="d214fn5">Not printed; 15 pages in
                                length, it outlined a proposal for economic development of the

                        </p>
                        <p>In it I have sought to identify the United States with the forces of
                            peaceful, democratic change throughout Southeast Asia, to picture the
                            kind of future that the people there may achieve once the fighting has
                            been ended, and to offer our assistance and support in this great
                            effort</p>
                        <pb n="451" xml:id="pg_451" facs="0471"/>
                        <p>It is important, of course, that the language of such a statement be
                            sufficiently balanced to allow us room for maneuver while providing a
                            firm commitment of U.S. support for a new start in this war-torn region,
                            if the Communists will permit the establishment of peace.</p>
                        <p>As far as American public and Congressional opinion is concerned, I
                            believe that such a declaration of American political objectives in
                            Southeast Asia would be generally welcomed and applauded by members of
                            both political parties.</p>
                        <p>I also believe that at the very least such a statement will restore
                            confidence in the United States throughout Southeast Asia.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>1. In talking with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName>
                            yesterday afternoon, I gathered <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alexis
                                Johnson</persName> is moving ahead with plans to form a Southeast
                            Asia Task Force. <persName corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName>
                            indicated present thinking is to chair the Task Force with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHLT1">Koren</persName>, Director of Southeast Asian
                            Affairs at State, maintaining the Viet-Nam Task Force as a separate
                            entity. <persName corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHLT1">Koren</persName> will then effect necessary
                            liaison and coordination between the two groups.</p>
                        <p>I sense State may be running with this ball too quickly and that there is
                            a need to stop and look at the concept of Task Forces.</p>
                        <p>2. Based on past discussions within this office, on task force
                            organization, the important issues can be isolated as follows:</p>
                        <p>a. The scope and definition of responsibilities of the task force
                            director.</p>
                        <p>b. The Department from which the director is selected.</p>
                        <p>c. The character of the task force membership.</p>
                        <p>And, as a separate issue, related to the regional approach,</p>
                        <p>d. The organization in the field which can best respond to Washington
                            task force direction.</p>
                        <pb n="452" xml:id="pg_452" facs="0472"/>
                        <p>3. The Task Force Director should be formally chartered and accorded
                            specific responsibilities. He requires the tools to undertake an active
                            role in implementing an agreed Program; if his authority is not spelled
                            out, experience suggests the Task Force will become a passive forum.
                            Since the Special Group (<gloss target="#t_CI1">CI</gloss>) has specific
                            functions in Southeast Asia in accordance with <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 124,<note n="2" xml:id="d215fn2">
                                <ref target="#d26">Document 26</ref>.</note> and is to rely on
                            performing such functions upon country or regional interdepartmental
                            task forces, the relationship of the Task Force to the Special Group
                                (<gloss target="#t_CI1">CI</gloss>) should be dearly delineated. As
                            an example, I have attached a rough list of task force director
                            responsibilities which seem to me to meet the several needs without
                            intruding radically on sensitive departmental prerogatives.</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 124 indicates a task force is
                            normally to be chaired by a State Department Assistant Secretary. That
                            level of rank is desirable if any degree of authority is to be
                            plausible. In addition, Task Force operation would be smoother if the
                            Director came from the Department of dominant interest. In the situation
                            at hand, we are discussing South Viet-Nam with an active insurgency;
                            Laos with a dormant, but advanced state of insurgency; Cambodia, whose
                            internal security must depend in the immediate future on the Army rather
                            than on the police; and Thailand, which has US armed forces present but
                            whose immediate need is a build-up of non-military counter-insurgency
                            assets. A good argument can be made that Defense should chair this task
                            force but, at a minimum, the problem should be examined.</p>
                        <p>5. The character of the task force membership should be defined in the
                            formal charter referred to in paragraph 3 above. The membership
                            subordinate to the Director preferably should be at the regional level
                            within each department or agency. Membership would then be held down
                            numerically and, if the desk-level Viet-Nam Task Force continues
                            separately, many of the same individuals will not attend two meetings.
                            At the regional rank level, it will be easier to effect the broad
                            coordination implicit in the establishment of a <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> Task Force.</p>
                        <p>6. There has been previous discussion as to the desirability of some sort
                            of regional US administrator on-the-ground in Southeast Asia. You will
                            recall Mr. Godel's recommendations of last fall on this point. Since the
                            military currently has this arrangement, it is perhaps more desirable
                            now that non-military functions be so organized. If we are to effect
                            coordination in Washington through a regional Task Force, a parallel
                            organization in the field would help to gain compatible approaches to
                            priorities of effort, allocation and interchangeability of resources,
                            coordination across country boundaries, and centralized <pb n="453" xml:id="pg_453" facs="0473"/>capability to respond. It is largely a
                            political problem, however, and in the past State has objected on the
                            grounds that it is not diplomatically realistic among the diverse and
                            contentious states of <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>7. While the State desire to keep the Viet-Nam Task Force separate from a
                                <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> Task Force is understandable,
                            for many of the reasons listed above this proposition should be reviewed
                            before a new Task Force is formed. If separated, it means individual
                            attendance to some extent at two Task Force meetings, the possible
                            generation of requirements in South Viet-Nam not coordinated with those
                            of the rest of Southeast Asia, and a split responsibility in Washington
                            administration of programs in the region. In addition, since <persName corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName> does not have specific

                            Viet-Nam Task Force would not properly complement a Southeast Asia Task

                        <p>8. These observations are not intended to provide answers. They do,
                            however, point up some of the considerations which we have been unable
                            to attack directly in the past. Current formulation of a Southeast Asia
                            Task Force affords an excellent opportunity to look at these matters
                            now. I suggest that this sort of an examination would be appropriate
                            within the responsibilities of the Special Group (<gloss target="#t_CI1">CI</gloss>) and you may desire to consider an approach on that
                            basis.</p>

                            problem correct. Objective our proposals is to invigorate and accelerate
                            counterinsurgency programs to maximum extent. Obstacles to this are
                            varied. On one hand there is essentially psychological problem on
                            Vietnamese side represented by prospective budget deficit and drop in
                            foreign exchange holdings. On other hand there is practical problem of
                            getting in hands US Mission sufficient dollar and piaster resources for
                            application to counterinsurgency program in countryside. Our premise is
                            that by bringing in “new money” and by making concessions on limited
                            worldwide procurement to meet second problem we will obtain leverage to
                            overcome psychological obstacles represented by former and, secondarily,
                            to relieve to some degree the budgetary and foreign exchange problems
                            themselves. It is important, however, to keep the two problems
                            conceptually distinct, even though we must work on them together.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> (and <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> especially) is overwhelmed by size projected budget
                            deficit this CY. As a result, it has been focusing most of its fiscal
                            attention on ways of trimming ministerial budgets; rather than finding
                            excess funds in those budgets for application to counterinsurgency. Of
                            course, neither we nor <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> knows exactly
                            what budget deficit will be at end CY. They now claim 4.8 billion
                            piasters—it will probably be materially smaller. In any event important
                            point in our proposal to buy piasters is not related to budget deficit
                            except to extent <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> unable or unwilling
                            fund counterinsurgency in face of potential deficit. Whether deficit is
                            entirely manageable in financial terms without extraordinary aid is thus
                            beside point; point is <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> doesn't
                            believe it manageable.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_PA1">PA</gloss> procedure proposed in other telegrams
                            should be viewed in similar light. We not addressing ourselves to
                            balance of payments problem or <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            exchange reserve position. Rather, we are trying to develop system
                            through which US can inject itself into counterinsurgency operations
                            through procurement, stockpiling, distribution, etc. In the process, it
                            is essential that we develop procedures which will sharply reduce <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> bureaucratic entanglements and
                            procedural bottlenecks. We are not, however, going to bypass the Saigon
                            Ministerial machine completely. This is simply not acceptable to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, and <pb n="455" xml:id="pg_455" facs="0475"/>there should be no illusions that this is what we
                            expect to obtain. We do believe that we can develop procedures for
                            prompt and effective use of piaster and dollar resources made available
                            to US.</p>
                        <p>To summarize, our basic argument for extraordinary actions at this time
                            is not need for dollars to correct fall in reserves nor need for
                            piasters to correct deficit problem as such. Our objectives are (a) to
                            cope with Counterinsurgency Program, (b) to provide psychological carrot
                            which will relieve <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> preoccupation
                            with deficit and exchange position, and (c) to avoid situation in which
                            US-generated local currency is bound into existing counterpart system
                            which is not satisfactory for needs war situation. US strategic
                            interests in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> demand, in my opinion,
                            that we find a way to achieve these objectives on an urgent basis.</p>
                        <p>As for amount needed initially to meet these objectives, our proposals
                            call for $10 million on dollar side and $10 million for piaster
                            generation. Basis for these figures is set out in next following
                                telegram<note n="3" xml:id="d216fn3">Not printed. (Department of
                                State, Central Files, 811.005K/6-1462)</note> (together with answers
                            other questions raised <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>). We
                            would like authority to commit ourselves to expend full amount both
                            categories in CY 1962. If fund availabilities do not permit these
                            amounts in FY 62, it will be satisfactory to commit during this month
                            whatever funds are available, if we can give firm assurances that
                            balance can be committed July from FY 63 funds.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HF5">Fowler</persName> has not seen this message,
                            although he and we have discussed the problem thoroughly. He agrees that
                            extraordinary approach is justified on political/psychological grounds
                            as experimental measure to break present impasse counterinsurgency
                            program. He also agrees that type of extraordinary approach we have
                            proposed is sound one. Believe, however, that he would prefer see
                            smaller amounts committed initially, with expectation they could be
                            augmented if device proved successful. While this approach is certainly
                            understandable, in my judgment to go below the figures proposed would
                            jeopardize chances of achieving psychological breakthrough on <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> side and hence would risk our chances
                            of success.</p>

                            violations of a continuing nature and for <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> to inform Co-Chairman periodically e.g. annually under
                            Article 43 of the Agreement that parties failing put into effect <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> recommendations, and that violations
                            previously reported continue. In this regard point out that there
                            nothing in the Agreement that requires <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> to make citations re each separate incident that
                            occurs. Thus under Agreement <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> is free

                        </list>
                        <p>I met with the Vietnamese Ambassador, <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Tran
                                Van Chuong</persName>, from 9:00 p.m. until 12:30 a.m. on June 14,
                            1962. The conversation covered a great range of matters; much of it was
                            confused and disjointed. However, there emerged from it several
                            principal ideas which he apparently wanted to communicate to Senator
                            Mansfield without doing so directly himself.</p>
                        <p>(1) That the <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> government is in
                            very deep trouble and has little prospects for survival. The principal
                            faults, as he saw it, are those which have been indicated in the press
                            from time to time, such as the family control, <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s obliviousness to the realities
                            around him, his mandarin tendencies which discourage any but relatives
                            and “secretaries” from working for him. He made no criticism of
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> as a man, of his
                            patriotism and his dedication, but it was clear that he felt these were
                            insufficient attributes to deal with the present situation. He did not
                            say so in so many words, but there was implicit in his remarks, a belief
                            that a coup was imminent.</p>
                        <p>(2) He was trying, I believe, to find out through me what Senator
                            Mansfield's position would be in the event of such a coup. He had a very
                            clear recollection of what he believed to be a decisive statement at the
                            time <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> first came to power. He
                            made reference to the fact that Senator Mansfield had said at that time
                            that it was either <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> or no
                            foreign aid and he knew that this was what had persuaded both Bao Dai
                            and the French to bow out. He was exploring to see what would happen at
                            this time in the event that <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>
                            was threatened with imminent <pb n="458" xml:id="pg_458" facs="0478"/>overthrow. Would it mean that Senator Mansfield again would say, in
                            effect, <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> or no foreign aid? I
                            told him that I did not know what Senator Mansfield would say but that
                            he would very likely support President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> who had to make the critical decisions.</p>
                        <p>(3) As regards the speech,<note n="2" xml:id="d218fn2">Reference is
                                presumably to the commencement speech that Mansfield presented at
                                Michigan State University, June 10. See <ref target="#d214fn4">Document 214, footnote 4</ref>.</note> he understood the
                            factors which had given rise to it, both those at home and those in Viet
                            Nam and elsewhere in Southeast Asia. But he feared for its effect on
                            foreign aid appropriations. I told him that Senator Mansfield was, as
                            far as I could see, trying to deal only with the realities in the
                            situation, recognizing the difficulties in Southeast Asia as well as our
                            own limitations, but that Senator Mansfield had given and would
                            undoubtedly continue to give full support to whatever the President
                            decided.</p>
                        <p>(4) He apparently expects the coup to come from a combination of the
                            military and the presently dispossessed intellectuals, including those
                            whose political backgrounds, like his own, predate <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>. He does not expect this to be a
                            democratic uprising. On the contrary, he was highly critical of the fact
                            that <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> had established the
                            forms of democracy in Viet Nam, forms which he felt were unsuited to the
                            situation and which led to irresponsibility. In other words, what he
                            anticipates and, I am quite certain that what he is inclined to support,
                            is something on the Korean pattern in the hopes that such a regime can
                            more effectively administer the nation and use aid more pointedly. He
                            was, to some extent, also critical of the past administration of aid in
                            Viet Nam. This he attributed both to the inadequacies of some of our
                            people and to the type of Vietnamese administration which had evolved
                            under <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>. The successor group
                            which he anticipates, presumably, would be far more militant in its
                            military policies than <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>. He
                            spoke even of the possibilities of moving into Laos militarily if not
                            into North Viet Nam by hit-and-run tactics.</p>
                        <p>(5) He is afraid of the Laotian solution for a somewhat ironic reason.
                                <hi rend="italic">He is afraid that the Communists will make it
                                work</hi>. He believes they may do so as a preliminary for what
                            would be a diplomatic offensive to bring about neutralism in South Viet
                            Nam. These steps he believes are part of a plan for the conquest of
                            Southeast Asia by the Communists without force. He expressed fears at
                            the present tendencies in American policy. While understanding the
                            political limitations on actions, he raised questions about where this
                            course would eventually lead, insisting that if we continued in the
                            Laotian pattern we might in time have no alternative but a nuclear war.
                            He dated the development of this approach from the time MacArthur was
                            prevented from bombing behind the Yalu. He obviously would like to see a
                            much more militant policy. He mentioned the possible use of Chiang <pb n="459" xml:id="pg_459" facs="0479"/>Kai-shek against the mainland,
                            the use of Thai forces as well as the previously noted references to
                            Vietnamese forces in Laos. He expressed the hope at the end of the
                            conversation, once again, as he had done several times during the talk,
                            that Senator Mansfield would not despair of the situation in Viet Nam
                            and that he would recognize that there are good and able people and a
                            considerable amount of leadership ability not now being used. This,
                            again, I took to be a reference to the imminent possibilities of a coup
                            against <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>.</p>

                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_AGWJ1">Anderson</persName> indicated that

                            what course of action we would follow if <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> should pass from the scene. Mr.
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> replied that last fall certain general
                            guidance on the subject was passed to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d219fn2">See the enclosure to the letter from <persName corresp="#p_MCWPJ1">McConaughy</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> in <ref target="frus1961-63v01#d181">

                                    Document 181</ref>.</note> The thrust of this guidance is the
                            provision of a high degree of flexibility and authority to the
                            Ambassador as the man on the spot. He has a wide measure of discretion
                            in determining who the most likely successor will and should be. His
                            guidance, which has just been reviewed with him indicates that the most
                            likely candidates for the present are <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>. We
                            recognize that the military would probably constitute the base of power
                            for any successor regime. However, we have indicated that if at all
                            possible a new regime should be given a civilian complexion with
                            emphasis on the constitutional aspects. <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s departure <pb n="460" xml:id="pg_460" facs="0480"/>from the scene would place a great strain on our entire mission in
                            Saigon and one man (the Ambassador) must be free to call the shots as he
                            sees them.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_AGWJ1">Anderson</persName> asked if
                                <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName> would be the
                            constitutional successor in the event of the death of <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>, and Mr.
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> replied in the affirmative indicating
                            that <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName> was acceptable to us.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCB1">Wood</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> were in jail together under the French and are
                            very close personally. We would have a satisfactory situation with
                                <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName> as the civilian head of
                            government supported by big Minh heading the military element. We would
                            like to use people presently in the government and avoid the use of
                            local people who are not now active in the government. We do not wish to
                            have the government taken over by politicians who are presently in exile
                            because they are out of touch with the local situation and would
                            compound the problems involved in a change of leadership. We would have
                            to move rapidly if we are to avoid a Communist takeover, and we do not
                            need a quarterback in Washington. The Ambassador has proper guidance and
                            full authority to carry it out.</p>

                        <p>Dear Fitz: At Cot's suggestion I spoke June 16th to the Counterinsurgency
                            Group on my trip to Viet-Nam.<note n="2" xml:id="d221fn2">No record of
                                the June 16 meeting has been found.</note> The <gloss target="#t_CIG1">CIG</gloss> is chaired by General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> and is usually attended at
                            the Undersecretary level by the Departments concerned.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I stressed:</p>
                        <pb n="462" xml:id="pg_462" facs="0482"/>
                        <p>1. That the question of deciding whether the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> was moving too fast in creating Strategic Hamlets was
                            one which depended on many local variables and that the decisions should
                            be made in Saigon. However, we could help the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> move faster by supplying more piasters for locally
                            obtainable products and services. The members of the Group appeared to
                            agree.</p>
                        <p>2. That we would ask you to consider whether it would be feasible to make
                            more bulldozers and dredges available (from those already in Viet-Nam)
                            to speed the work of'6uilding ditches and walls around Strategic
                            Hamlets.</p>
                        <p>3. I mentioned various items of military equipment which American and
                            Vietnamese officers at the province level had particularly requested,
                            emphasizing that I was not qualified to pass any judgments. The items
                            were more grenade launchers (to lob grenades over the walls of rice
                            paddies), more armalite rifles, more helicopters (requested by the
                            Vietnamese), and more Caribou aircraft. General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> said that he believed more
                            Caribou are available in Thailand and asked that the matter be
                            explored.</p>
                        <p rend="center">… … .</p>
                        <p>Today, Joe Alsop gave a lunch for Colonel Thao which Cot, Mike Forrestal
                            and I attended. Thao stressed the following points to Alsop and so I
                            suppose more will be heard of these suggestions in Washington:</p>
                        <p> Thao is convinced that if the situation in Laos weakens further and the
                            route through Attopeau into Kontum becomes more easily accessible to the
                            Viet Cong, it must be expected that they will bring in increased numbers
                            of mortars and recoilless artillery. Based on his own experiences in the
                            Indochina War, he also felt that it was relatively easy for the Viet
                            Cong to bring in a few hundred technicians to manufacture mortars,
                            recoilless artillery, and projectiles in South Viet-Nam. Thao believes
                            that the United States must therefore face the necessity of promptly
                            making a further major increase in its efforts to assist the Vietnamese.
                            He is convinced that this further effort should be concentrated on (a)
                            artillery for the Vietnamese forces and more artillery training for
                            Vietnamese officers in the United States; (b) a change in the employment
                            of our helicopters, and an increase in their total numbers so that these
                            would be available in larger numbers rather than used in small groups
                            throughout the country; (c) a major increase in the Civil Guard and the
                            Self Defense Corps without a corresponding increase in <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>After the lunch Thao told me that in his private opinion it would be very
                            useful to invite <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> to this country for a
                            relatively quiet two weeks, primarily for informal, high-level
                            consultations in Washington. He is concerned by
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>'s well-known anti-Americanism, by his thought
                            processes which frequently parallel the Communists', and particularly by
                            the fact that, in Thao's opinion, <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> thinks in
                            terms of the type of tactics which the Communists employed a decade ago.
                            He commented that Communist tactics had improved since then, but <pb n="463" xml:id="pg_463" facs="0483"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>'s had not. Thao emphasized frequently how much
                            he, Thao, was impressed by the differences between the American and
                            Vietnamese governments. He believes firmly that such a visit would be
                            most useful in changing <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>'s views.<note n="3" xml:id="d221fn3">In the margin next to this paragraph <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> wrote: “I think

                        <p>For the past month Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>, General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>, and the rest of the country team in South
                            Vietnam have been pressing very hard for a rapid increase in the amount
                            of local currency (piasters) available for counterinsurgency <pb n="464" xml:id="pg_464" facs="0484"/>activities in South Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s people have complained that,
                            owing to a 4.8 billion piaster estimated budget deficit this year (U.S.
                            estimate: 3 to 4 billion), decline in tax revenues, and the failure of
                            the Vietnamese economy to absorb sufficient high cost American imports,
                            there is a shortage of local currency. They also point out that their
                            gold reserves have slipped from $200 million plus to $164 million.</p>
                        <p>Due to this situation the <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>
                            regime asked for a $25-million cash grant and an across-the-board waiver
                            of all “Buy American” restrictions.</p>
                        <p>The Defense Department and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> have argued strongly that local funds for
                            counterinsurgency must be provided quickly, directly to the field and
                            preferably under U.S. control. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> feels that this is of the highest importance,
                            since it affects particularly those military programs which are vital at
                            this time, i.e. aid to the Montagnards who defect from the Viet Cong and
                            the strategic village and related programs.</p>
                        <p>The Aid Agency on purely economic grounds questioned the advisability of
                            providing cash grants to <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> at
                            this time, pointing out that the better way to generate local currency
                            was to have the <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> Government
                            borrow from the central bank, i.e. print money.</p>
                        <p>The State Department, while sympathetic to the Aid Agency position, came
                            to the conclusion that the military urgency was so great and the
                            political resistance of the <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>
                            Government to deficit financing was so strong, that the following
                            compromise on a one-shot basis offered the best solution</p>
                        <p>1. An offer to <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> of a cash
                            grant of $10 million in return for which <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> will deposit piasters at a rate of approximately 73
                            to the dollar in an account which will be available to the United States
                            for counterinsurgency purposes in Vietnam. (This, I gather, would be a
                            direct charge on our balance of payments.)</p>
                        <p>2. The waiver of the “Buy American” restrictions with respect to $8
                            million of funds already obligated but not yet used to finance the
                            importation of items useful in the counterinsurgency campaign (i.e.
                            fertilizers, barbed wire, etc.) which would generate an equivalent
                            amount of local currency, also to be used by the U.S.</p>
                        <p>3. The waiver of “Buy American” restrictions on $12 million of industrial
                            imports to bolster the general economy of South Vietnam. This is new
                            money and together with the funds referred to in (2) above would also
                            constitute a charge against our balance of payments to the extent that
                            imports were made from countries other than the United States. The
                            maximum potential gold drain is thus on the order of $30 million.</p>

                        <p>There has been an exchange of cables with <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> which has resulted in <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>'s having been given authority
                            generally to negotiate within the above three actions. Negotiations are
                            not to start, however, until the State Department has sent further
                            details on certain technical points. I have asked that these
                            negotiations be held up pending your review.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Comment</p>
                        <p>This problem boils down essentially to a political decision. I am told
                            that the <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> regime is adamant
                            in their refusal to finance the local currency requirements of
                            counterinsurgency operation by increasing their budgetary deficit. This
                            appears to be the only other quick way of generating the piasters
                            without the United States simply purchasing them for dollars. If we
                            refuse a cash grant and refuse to waive the “Buy American” restrictions,
                            I am told that <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> would not
                            finance the counterinsurgency programs. This is blackmail, and I am
                            personally convinced that our objective should be to force <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> to increase his economy's
                            contribution to the war effort by increased taxes and deficit financing
                            if that is necessary. Not only are cash grants from us a charge on our
                            balance of payments, but, perhaps even more importantly, they may
                            encourage socially undesirable activities in war time, such as the
                            importation of some luxuries and possibly the flight of capital. Despite
                            feeling this way, I did approve the sending of a telegram to Nolting
                            authorizing him to begin negotiations on the above described
                                program.<note n="2" xml:id="d223fn2">Presumably a reference to <ref target="#d212">Document 212</ref>.</note> I was mainly moved by
                            the need at this time for speed as expressed by the military. It seemed
                            that this was perhaps not the best time to force the political issue.
                            Since no steps have been taken, the decision can be modified or
                            reversed; and even if you approve the currency proposal, you can and, I
                            hope would direct the Departments and the country team to raise the
                            whole issue of deficit financing with <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> in the strongest possible terms, so that the
                            question of cash grants and waivers will not come up again. This should
                            be done simultaneously with the current negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, I would recommend that you first discuss the general
                            political and financial problems of South Vietnam with Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> in order to
                            ascertain how strongly he feels about the necessity of swallowing this
                            bitter pill now. If you are convinced of the military and immediate
                            political necessity to go ahead, then you might approve the program
                            described above with an injunction to the Departments concerned and to
                            the field to tell <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> that we
                            are simply not prepared to continue our support of their war unless he
                            does his <pb n="466" xml:id="pg_466" facs="0486"/>share. The United
                            States has been forced into deficit financing and a drain on its gold
                            reserves in order to meet its commitments throughout the free world. The
                            least we can expect is for those Governments whom we help to take their
                            fair share of the burden.</p>
                        <p>One last point on the balance of payments and the waiver of “Buy
                            American” restrictions. I have asked why it is not possible for the
                            American commodities whose importation to South Vietnam we finance to be
                            sold locally at lower prices, thus avoiding having to buy them from
                            other countries. I have not got a satisfactory explanation of why this
                            isn't possible, and would hope you would approve my telling State that
                            this should be done unless Nolting can give a convincing explanation why
                            not. This would save up to $12 million of the $30 million charge against
                            the balance of payments. It would also be an additional cost to the U.S.
                            internal budget.</p>

                        <p>3. From US standpoint, our immediate objectives would be satisfied if

                            These two elements would take certain measure counterinsurgency funding
                            out of competition other funding requirements and give it special status
                            as to priority and normal procedures. It would also provide more

                            purchase plus US military purchases in VN will result in significant

                        <p>5. Would not object proposals for shifting to commercial import program
                            additional acceptable items. This would permit <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> financing of imports from Europe and Japan with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> foreign exchange.</p>

                            budgetary problem. Food for troops might offer possibility.</p>
                        <pb n="468" xml:id="pg_468" facs="0488"/>
                        <p>7. We are willing to maintain in force at reduced level the waiver
                            granted for counterinsurgency imports on the understanding that the
                            waiver will be utilized only in rare cases where the time factor does
                            not allow timely delivery or when goods not available from an eligible
                            source. Request prompt arrangements be made to plan requirements
                            sufficiently in advance so that utilization this waiver authority will
                            be extremely rare ($3 million maximum suggested).</p>
                        <p>8. If there is a priority requirement for commodities to be financed in
                            commercial import program which cannot be obtained from a limited
                            worldwide source, we would require more details concerning the type of
                            commodities required and the extent to which alternate sources of
                            financing have been explored to allow <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>/W to consider waivers on a case by case basis. Note
                            this connection that we have recently granted waiver for $4-1/2 million
                            for spare parts but only for non-US machinery and for machinery which
                            cannot be obtained in US.</p>

                        <p>1659. Dr Gordon Smith, American medical missionary from Danang, visited
                            me June 22. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SBK1">Smith</persName> has lived
                            and worked in Viet Nam for some thirty years, mainly among the
                            Montagnard population in central Viet Nam. In summary, main points which
                            Dr <persName corresp="#p_SBK1">Smith</persName> made were:</p>
                        <p>1. Military situation and aggressiveness of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> military and paramilitary forces have greatly improved
                            during past six months. He thought that without increased US assistance
                            last winter, Viet Cong would by now have taken over <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. He was especially complimentary of
                            work of Special Forces Units.</p>
                        <p>2. Nevertheless, popular support for <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            continued to decrease alarmingly in central coastal provinces (Quang
                            Nam, Quang Ngai, Binh Dinh, Phu Yen) where Dr <persName corresp="#p_SBK1">Smith</persName> has wide first-hand knowledge of conditions. He
                            attributed this to belief by people of Communist allegations against
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> and his family and
                            government; to lack of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> contact with
                            people; and to lack of efficiency in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s execution of plans for benefit of people. He said that
                            most of his own converts. <pb n="469" xml:id="pg_469" facs="0489"/>both
                            Vietnamese and Montagnards, several now themselves Christian
                            missionaries, were bitterly anti-government and thus inclined to believe
                            promises of Viet Cong that liberation Front would be better than present
                            government.</p>
                        <p>3. He then said that it was his strong impression that American military
                            influence in central Viet Nam was pressing Vietnamese military in
                            direction of a military coup d'etat against the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. I questioned him very closely on this. He said that
                            many US military advisors of his own acquaintance, whose work in
                            military field he greatly admired, had said repeatedly in presence
                            Vietnamese officers that anti-guerrilla war was being waged in the teeth
                            of a predominantly hostile population, made so by the inefficiency and
                            ineffectiveness of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>; and that on
                            this basis military campaigns were bound to be unsuccessful or
                            ineffective. He said that this was almost the universal theme of
                            American military officers in his area. He said that Vietnamese military
                            officers, who generally inclined to this view themselves, took the
                            American officers' remarks to mean US military advocacy of an <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> military coup d'etat. Dr <persName corresp="#p_SBK1">Smith</persName> said that he himself thought that
                            military rule would be more effective and more popular than that of the
                            present regime. I told Dr <persName corresp="#p_SBK1">Smith</persName>,
                            that if his observations were correct, this was a most serious matter. I
                            explained to him US policy of support to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> through the constitutionally elected government, and
                            the reasons therefore. I also mentioned certain plans, agreements,
                            programs, and some progress in improving the performance of the GV on
                            the civil side. (Comment: Dr <persName corresp="#p_SBK1">Smith</persName>'s observations, which were sincerely given and
                            apparently without any ulterior motive, may indeed account for some of
                            the hesitancy and suspicion on part of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, more noticeable in recent weeks.)</p>
                        <p>Dr <persName corresp="#p_SBK1">Smith</persName> also discussed at length
                            the Montagnard problem. He believes that only through generous
                            government measures to feed, house, clothe, and eventually resettle the
                            mountain people who have come into <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            controlled territory, can others be induced to escape from Viet Cong
                            control. He also expressed view that tribes people had very little, if
                            any, political convictions and would go along with the side which seemed
                            the stronger.</p>
                        <p>On the whole, Dr <persName corresp="#p_SBK1">Smith</persName>'s views on
                            the situation in central coastal provinces were discouraging. Since he
                            intends to continue his work in Viet Nam, and is even now seeking a
                            grant of land from GVN to establish a leper hospital near Danang, it is
                            very important that his views as summarized above be closely
                            protected.</p>
                        <p>I have discussed para 3 above with Gen. <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> who is planning a trip to area involved and will
                            take appropriate measures.</p>

                            <item>Conversation with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh
                                    Nhu</persName> on 22 June 1962</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>1. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said that although he had originated the
                            strategic hamlet program, it was only an idea, a “pipe-dream”, to him
                            until the last four months. Since that time he has been making constant
                            trips to the provinces, particularly to the south. During his more
                            recent trips, all ceremonies were eliminated and he insisted on only
                            single course meals. Most of his time was consumed by visits to hamlets
                            and meetings with strategic hamlet teams, hamlet chiefs, province
                            chiefs, district chiefs and committees. These discussions often lasted
                            as long as five hours. He found the trips very tiring but at the same
                            time exhilarating because he had been able to test out his theories
                            about strategic hamlets through actual experience.</p>
                        <p>2. He viewed the strategic hamlets as a means to defeat communism while,
                            at the same fume, overcoming the problems of an underdeveloped country.
                            These problems, in addition to communism, were separatism among various
                            groups of the population and inherited systems of privileges. He said
                            the imposition of democracy at the top in an under-developed country
                            brought anarchy which resulted in dictatorship. Democracy must be
                            instituted at a level where the people can understand it and where it
                            can be a revolution to eliminate the existing system of privileges and
                            the defeatism and separatism which exists in the minds of the
                            people.</p>
                        <p>3. In time of war people think you must suppress democracy to win. To the
                            contrary, he said, we shall use the war against communism as a means to
                            introduce democracy and we shall use democracy to win the war. This is
                            the strategic concept.</p>
                        <p>4. Free elections of the hamlet chief and hamlet council are the key to
                            success of the strategic hamlets. The first thing
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> asks when he visits a hamlet and talks to
                            the hamlet council is how were the elections conducted. He tells the
                            district committees (for strategic hamlets) that hamlet governments
                            elected by a show of hands are only provisional. If they are not sure of
                            a hamlet, they may have an initial provisional electron through a show
                            of hands. However, they must have an electron by secret ballot before
                            the strategic hamlet (civic <pb n="471" xml:id="pg_471" facs="0491"/>action) team goes on to another hamlet and before the hamlet can
                            receive a charter (which <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> describes as a social
                            contract between the province and the hamlet). He tells the cadres
                            working in the hamlet that they must not tell the people who to vote
                            for; otherwise the election defeats its own purpose. If the cadres want
                            a particular person to be elected, that person must prove himself to the
                            people by working harder than the others. If he deserves to be elected,
                            he will be elected.</p>
                        <p>5. In answer to a question whether he did not think the Government should
                            attract the Viet Cong to surrender, he said that this was very
                            necessary. He said he had indications that the strategic hamlets were
                            demoralizing the Viet Cong. He felt that the Government should urge them
                            to surrender and rejoin their families. Special fortified or combat
                            hamlets might be established with these families as volunteers to fight
                            the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>6. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said he was not satisfied with the
                            concept of the defended hamlet as it had been applied so far in Vietnam.
                            He did not believe that uprooting people was the best answer—it resulted
                            in too many problem and was too expensive. He had discussed a new idea
                            with the strategic hamlet committee during its meeting Friday morning.
                            He wants to induce young families to volunteer to establish defended
                            hamlets; then attract people to these hamlets from the Viet Cong areas.
                            These new hamlets would be similar to the Israeli Kibutzes. Each
                            defended hamlet would have several commando groups similar to those in
                            operation now on the high plateau, which would ensure security outside
                            the fortified hamlet.</p>
                        <p>7. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> felt that the two major weapons which
                            could be used to win the war were the strategic hamlets and the
                            commandos. He wanted each hamlet or at least every village to have a
                            commando team which would operate as guerrillas, in similar fashion to
                            Viet Cong tactics. He was very impressed with the Montagnard teams he
                            had seen on the high plateau recently. This, he felt, was the answer to
                            carrying the offensive to the Communists. He believed that harassment by
                            the commandos would force the Viet Cong to group for protection, and
                            when this happened the Army could strike with its mobile forces carried
                            by helicopters.</p>
                        <p>8. He said he had asked some of the men being trained by our Special
                            Forces what they thought of the Americans and got back the reply that
                            they weren't like the French at all but were their friends, ate their
                            food and worked alongside them. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> felt there
                            should be more Americans like this in the countryside.</p>
                        <p>9. Finally, he felt that placing the divisional commanders in charge of
                            the strategic hamlet program in their tactical zones would be very
                            helpful. The Army could thus give the additional support to the program
                            to make it succeed.</p>

                        <p>From experience gained in other countries, particularly in the
                            Philippines, the most urgent need in defeating a Communist guerrilla
                            movement is a firm political base among the people. With most of the
                            Vietnamese village people neutral in the present struggle, such a base
                            does not yet exist in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The strategic hamlet program, as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> conceives
                            of it, presents an excellent chance to build a political base of popular
                            support at the hamlet level. The danger is that the hamlet elections,
                            which are the key to the success of the program, may not be genuine. The
                            central problem is that many Vietnamese lack experience and confidence
                            in democratic procedures. It is easier for them to tell their people
                            what to do. And they are fearful of making a mistake, particularly of
                            ever electing a Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>My superficial observation after inspection trips to Phu Yen and Tay Ninh
                            provinces and considerable talk with local officials is that too many
                            strategic hamlet teams are forcing these elections, even though they
                            told me that all elections were now being held by secret ballot.</p>
                        <p>Without offending the Vietnamese, we can do much to lend them moral as
                            well as material support in the strategic hamlet effort. My impression
                            is that they are in an experimental frame of mind. Most of them know
                            that they must in the final analysis, win the enthusiastic support of
                            the villagers if the Communists are to be defeated. However, they tend
                            to become preoccupied with the control or repressive aspects of the
                            program. We must help them learn how to generate and keep alive the
                            enthusiasm of their own people, knowing that without strong popular
                            support no amount of men or material will win this war.</p>

                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">Note:</hi> During a farewell call on the Chinese
                            Ambassador he decided to engage in a very frank exchange on the
                            situation in Viet-Nam. At the conclusion, he expressed the desire that
                            his views not be repeated to others. Therefore, this memorandum should
                            be regarded as containing very sensitive information and recipients are
                            requested not to give it any further distribution.)</p>
                        <p>In an exchange assessing the strategic hamlets program the Chinese
                            Ambassador expressed serious concern that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> Minister of Interior, Bui Van Luong, in his recent
                            speech on the program before the Lions Club, placed economic and social
                            development of the hamlets in the fourth phase of the program. The
                            Ambassador repeatedly emphasized that economic and social works to
                            improve the lot of the peasants should be in the very first phase
                            because they are essential for winning the people to the support of the
                            Government. He said the Vietnamese are a good people, but they have been
                            buffeted and forced to work for both sides in conflicts for 17 years
                            since 1945. Now that they are being asked once again by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to provide work and make other
                            sacrifices in connection with the strategic hamlets program, they must
                            be given some compensation for what they are being asked to do. If it is
                            not demonstrated to them that they are going to get something in the way
                            of concrete benefits out of this program, the risk is great that the
                            strategic hamlets program will drive them over to the enemy.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then said that it did not actually take much to gain the
                            loyalty of the Vietnamese peasants because they now have so little. He
                            mentioned the usual type of benefit which we have been <pb n="474" xml:id="pg_474" facs="0494"/>urging on the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, such as agricultural credits, schools, dispensaries
                            and agricultural tools, and also mentioned that he thought a little
                            cement to enable the peasants to pave the floors of their huts and thus
                            keep them dry underneath would be an extremely useful means of
                            attracting support.</p>
                        <p>He indicated that it is up to us Americans to find the means of inducing
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to undertake an adequate
                            economic and social program. He suggested the advisability of avoiding
                            any approach based on politics or principles, since either would ruffle
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> feathers, and thought perhaps
                            the best means might be simply to go to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and state that we have the money for such a program and
                            let's get started with one in specific places.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador stated that President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> is a fine man but he thinks only in black and white
                            without any shades or nuances. The Ambassador said he had talked with
                            Vice President <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName> about the
                            reported number of around 25,000 Viet-Cong, and indicated that many of
                            these are Hoa Hao and Cao Dai rather than Viet-Cong. He said the Vice
                            President had agreed with this analysis as well as with the Ambassador's
                            view that it would be desirable to win over by compromise the non-<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> fighting against the Government and thus
                            reduce the proportions of the guerrilla problem to those who are
                            actually Communists. Since President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>, however, sees things only in black and white he
                            refuses to make the compromise necessary for this purpose.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador also indicated the, the President puts too much emphasis
                            on the “moral side.” The President is stressing constantly what he
                            expects the people to do on behalf of the nation, but he should be
                            outlining to the peasants what the Government is going to do to better
                            their condition. The Ambassador concluded sorrowfully, however, that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s nature cannot be
                            changed and therefore effort must be made to find other means to meet
                            these problems. He reverted to his suggestion about the need for U.S.
                            efforts to sponsor economic and social development in the hamlets. He
                            indicated that he himself cannot influence the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> directly because he is obliged to talk very
                            circuitously with most <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> officials.
                            (This may have been an oblique reference by the Ambassador to the
                            pressures which can be placed by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            on the Chinese community in Viet-Nam unless the Chinese Ambassador
                            treads carefully.)</p>
                        <p>The Chinese Ambassador emphasized that the war in Viet-Nam should not be
                            permitted to drag on too long. Already, he said, some Vietnamese are
                            beginning to think in terms of neutralization of Viet-Nam. They ask that
                            if it can be done in Laos, why not in Viet-Nam? When I questioned him
                            more closely on this, the Ambassador said he has heard this view
                            particularly from representatives of the old scholar <pb n="475" xml:id="pg_475" facs="0495"/>class and not thus far from those who
                            are politically active. He indicated that in his view, however, these
                            thoughts of neutralization would spread as people became weary of the
                            continual killing.</p>
                        <p>I asked the Ambassador whether those who are talking about neutralization
                            are thinking just in terms of the South or all of Viet-Nam. He said that
                            most of them are thinking of neutralization initially of the South with
                            the thought that Viet-Nam might eventually be reunified over the longer
                            term. A few are thinking in terms of early neutralization of both parts
                            of Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> I was struck that for the first time
                            during my three years' service in Viet-Nam I had received serious

                            Vietnamese as a solution to the Vietnamese problem. It was even more
                            striking that this indication came in two conversations, one immediately

                            President he promptly suggested we drop our official capacities and
                            frankly discuss the Vietnamese situation as man to man. It is therefore
                            requested that the recipients of this memorandum regard it as containing
                            very sensitive information and make no further distribution of it.)</p>
                        <p>After discussing the morale and the military situation at the Vice
                            President's request, I stated that I thought that the strategic hamlet
                            concept represented a fine idea but I had rather deep reservations over
                            the way in which it is being executed. The Vice President immediately
                            expressed complete agreement and stressed the importance of executing
                            this program in a manner which will not alienate the peasants. He stated
                            several times that it is absolutely necessary that the peasants be paid
                            for the work which they are doing on the strategic hamlets and <pb n="476" xml:id="pg_476" facs="0496"/>took the position that this is
                            indispensable if they are to be won over to the Government. He said they
                            cannot be asked to make further sacrifices without payment. He noted
                            that he is receiving many complaints, both oral and written, from people
                            in the rural areas about the way the strategic hamlet program is being
                            executed. He referred to the recent ambush attack on a military convoy
                            1-1/2 miles from Ben Cat in which two U.S. officer advisors were killed
                            and pointed to this as an instance where the people in the area could
                            have given the Government forces advance warning, but did not because
                            they had not been won over.</p>
                        <p>I said it is important to establish priorities for the construction of
                            strategic hamlets and indicated that we are emphasizing this constantly
                            at the various layers of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. The
                            Vice President agreed stating that there are insufficient military
                            forces, civilian cadres, money, etc., to try to do too many strategic
                            hamlets at once. It is far better to carry out the program slowly but
                            surely than to try to push it to a hasty conclusion. In the end time
                            would have been saved by the former method.</p>
                        <p>I stated that establishing priorities requires a rational organization.
                            on the part of the Government. Again, the Vice President agreed but
                            added with emphasis and repeated it several times, a rational

                            the fact that about a year ago he was offered the post of Coordinating
                            Secretary of State for Security and said that he had refused it
                            precisely because he knew he would not be permitted to do the job
                            without interference by others in the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>We both agreed that we do not really know how to solve this
                            organizational problem of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. I
                            referred to <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>'s effort to provide
                            resources directly to the province chiefs as a means of getting around
                            the organizational problem. The Vice President said that this would
                            work, however, only as long as there is approval in principle by the
                            central government of a particular operation, since otherwise Saigon
                            will frustrate this method of meeting the problem.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President then said, however, that there is one extremely
                            important way in which the United States can use money directly and
                            effectively in the provinces—in the intelligence field. He said that if
                            the proper rapport is established between U.S. advisors in the provinces
                            with the province chiefs, they will find it possible to hand over money
                            directly to the latter for the improvement of intelligence networks
                            through adequate payment to informers. To establish the right kind of
                            rapport the Vice President emphasized the importance of assigning
                            Vietnamese language officers to these advisory positions. Recognizing
                            the practical difficulty in obtaining enough such officers to meet all
                            the requirements, he said it would be sufficient to assign one rotating
                            language officer to three or four provinces for this purpose. <pb n="477" xml:id="pg_477" facs="0497"/>The Vice President strongly
                            stressed that at the present time the intelligence agencies of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> scarcely know the enemy at all.
                            He asserted that information of a reliable kind can be obtained if
                            sufficient funds are available to send agents into the enemy areas to
                            collect it. The Vice President indicated that he could not overstress
                            the importance of this and suggested that, if necessary, we divert to
                            this intelligence purpose part of the funds that we are expanding in
                            Viet-Nam for other things. He indicated he was not thinking of small
                            amounts of money, but in terms of many millions of piasters.</p>
                        <p>Since the Vice President had brought up the influence of money in
                            connection with the success of both the strategic hamlets and the
                            intelligence programs, I felt it was important to determine whether he
                            considered this monetary factor of major importance in both central and
                            southern Viet-Nam. His immediate response was that he was thinking
                            particularly of the people in the southern area since they were the ones
                            he knows from his long experience as a province chief. He added that if
                            the southern area could be held against the Communists it would not be
                            too hard to hold the center, since the south provides the bread basket
                            of the country.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President declared that it is important to act quickly in taking
                            the proper measures to deal with the war. He warned that it should not
                            be allowed to drag on too long because that would discourage the people,
                            and at this point he warned with solemnity that the “Lao solution could
                            be catching.” He also indicated that it is important to bear in mind
                            that during the resumed Geneva Conference on Laos<note n="2" xml:id="d229fn2">The Geneva Conference on Laos resumed on July 2 and
                                concluded on July 23.</note> the Viet-Cong may well try to pull off
                            a sensational coup, such as, for example the capture of Pleiku.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President indicated that he hoped that we do not believe the
                            figures put out by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> on Viet-Cong
                            casualties. He said many of these casualties were not <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> at all but members of the population
                            killed by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces. If all these
                            casualties were <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, he said, the war
                            would be over.</p>
                        <p>(It is of interest that a reliable American source told me about two
                            weeks ago that Vice President <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName>
                            had just said to him in a conversation that, if another coup attempt
                            comes which appears likely to eliminate President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo

                            eliminated through assassination during the attendant confusion. When
                            the Vice President was asked why then he did not take measures to
                            protect himself, he replied stoically that he preferred not to spend all
                            of his time under guard, but to live as normally as possible. The Vice
                            President said he would be prepared to die, but would have preferred to
                            be killed by the Viet-Cong rather than by “one of our own.”)</p>

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is making progress against the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, but it is still too early to
                            predict assured success in the counterinsurgency effort. The strategic
                            hamlet program and the two clear-and-hold operations now under way are
                            moving forward well and seem to promise good results. With US
                            assistance, the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> has
                            significantly reduced its reaction time in recent months and appears to
                            have upset the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> timetable.</p>
                        <p>Government efficiency is slowly improving. By patient pressure, the
                            mission has been able to eliminate or shortcut some of the bureaucratic
                            delays, to speed supplies and funds to the clear-and-hold operations and
                            to the Montagnard refugees. The present mass movement of the Montagnards
                            out of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> controlled areas may represent
                            a major victory for the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> if it can
                            provide prompt relief measures and train the Montagnard irregulars.</p>
                        <p>On the negative side, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> control of the
                            rural areas is probably still being eroded faster than it is being
                            reinforced. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are attacking steadily
                            and frequently and retain the capacity to strike in battalion strength
                            at several points simultaneously. In spite of heavy losses, they seem
                            not to have been seriously hurt. Perhaps most important, the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> apparently retain the aura of
                            invincibility, while the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is making
                            only very slow progress in gaining the sympathy of the rural population
                            in some areas.</p>
                        <p>A major unsolved problem is the generation of piasters for the local
                            costs of the counterinsurgency programs. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, and President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> in particular, are fiscally very conservative and

                            to the point of cutting back on essential war measures to avoid further
                            deficits. If Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>
                            is able to keep the momentum of the counterinsurgency effort going with
                            the emergency measures we authorized last week, we must then engage in
                            serious talks with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> on the long

                        <p>Viet Cong attacks continue to be concentrated in the III Corps area.
                            Principal targets are still outposts, strategic hamlets, communication
                            routes, and agrovilles. During the first five months of the year, armed
                            attacks averaged 124 per week. In the period 5-11 June, armed attacks
                            dropped to 101, 73 less than the previous all-time high of the preceding
                            week. There were 91 armed attacks June 12-18. <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> casualties for the year now stand at 11,925, including
                            8,100 killed. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> losses for the year

                        <p>Operations Hai Yen (in Central Viet Nam) and Binh Minh or Sunrise
                            (northwest of Saigon in Binh Duong province) continue as planned. As of
                            June 15, military operations in the Hai Yen area were 30 days ahead of
                            schedule and 84 of the planned 270 strategic hamlets had been set up.
                            Financial bottlenecks which had hampered the Hai Yen operation in
                            earlier stages appear to be solved. The Province Chief now has Saigon's
                            assurances of funds to carry the operation through June 30 and a local
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>-US committee has been set up on
                            the ground to approve expenditures. Resettlement of 12,000-16,000 people
                            will be underway before the end of the month. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are reacting by increased activities in the area.</p>
                        <p>In Operation Binh Minh, a fourth strategic hamlet will probably be set up
                            this month. The population in the first two hamlets to be established
                            are now receiving simple basic self-defense training but have not been
                            armed. Indemnities for relocation losses have been paid to all eligible
                            families in these hamlets.</p>

                            to purchase 10 million dollars worth of piasters from the Viet Nam

                                <ref target="#d226">Document 226</ref>.</note> concerning
                            conversation between you and Reverend Smith at Danang.</p>
                        <p>On last Tuesday and Wednesday, I visited the Hue area and spoke with the
                            Senior Advisors from the I Corps area. None of the officers to whom I
                            have spoken, including Colonel Patten, were familiar with the fact that
                            any officer has spoken in a derogatory manner concerning the present
                            regime, and each officer expressed amazement and surprise.</p>
                        <p>As you have been previously informed, since August 1961, I have made a
                            particular point of personally orienting all the new personnel assigned
                            to <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>. A major part of this
                            orientation is devoted to explaining the U.S. position concerning our
                            unqualified support of the present government of Vietnam. It is
                            particularly emphasized that President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> and his associates have, since 1954, been faced
                            with both the war against the sects and more recently with the Communist
                            insurgency. It is further explained to the new <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> personnel that, in my opinion, President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> has proved himself to be the
                            greatest anti-Communist fighter in the world today. Also, that no other
                            country is so actively opposing Communism or making an effort of the
                            same magnitude to remain a part of the Free World. I also explain that
                            the reason for my orientation concerning the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is that certain of the critical articles appearing in
                            the various news media fail to take into account the tremendous
                            achievements of the government. Then I again discuss the position of the
                            United States with respect to supporting the legally authorized
                            government and explain that the consequences of failing to support the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> can only result to the profit of
                            the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>As you know, I make frequent visits to the various <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> detachments. On the occasions of each
                            visit, I always assemble the officers and enlisted men for the purpose
                            of discussing <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> operations and on
                            each of these occasions, I further stress the fact that <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> is here only to advise in military
                            matters and is not concerned in any way with local politics. Also, I
                            again point out the position of the U.S. Government and our adherence to
                            this position.</p>

                            of your concern over our Laos policy. It is a concern which I have long
                            shared; the Laos situation is difficult, and the negotiations we are now
                            seeking to complete at Geneva have not been easy. Perhaps it would be
                            useful if I indicated to you in brief the basis of our thinking about
                            Laos and our Southeast Asia policy as a whole.</p>
                        <pb n="498" xml:id="pg_498" facs="0518"/>
                        <p>We have sought to counter the Communist drive in Southeast Asia by
                            programs and tactics which recognize both the regional nature of the
                            Communist threat and the peculiar circumstances of each country in the
                            region. We vary our strategies but at the same time we maintain our
                            overall policy objective, which is to do everything in our power to help
                            the nations of Southeast Asia preserve their independence.</p>
                        <p>In Laos, the United States believes that a neutral government, committed
                            to neither the West nor the East, is most likely to succeed in providing
                            the Lao people with peace and freedom. We are supported in this belief
                            by most Free World Governments.</p>
                        <p>In negotiating with the Communists to achieve a free and neutral Laos, we
                            have not been unmindful of the relationship between Laos and the
                            security of its neighbors. We have sought to build adequate safeguards
                            into the Laos settlement. We are aware of the danger that the Communists
                            will not honor their pledges. But the only alternative to a neutral Laos
                            appears to be making an international battleground of Laos. This would
                            not help the Lao people and it would not contribute to the security of
                            Laos' neighbors.</p>
                        <p>In the case of your own country, the strategy best calculated to preserve
                            Vietnamese independence and enable your brave people to build a better
                            future is clearly very different from the strategy required for Laos. I
                            can assure you without reservation that this administration is not
                            seeking a neutral solution for Viet-Nam. There is no change in the
                            policy towards Viet-Nam which this administration has pursued since it
                            took office. We have helped and shall continue to help the Vietnamese
                            defend themselves. We believe our cooperation has been effective and
                            will continue to improve. We believe the Vietnamese will defeat
                            Communist aggression and subversion</p>
                        <p>In pursuing our efforts to insure peace and freedom for the people of
                            Southeast Asia the United States must, of course depend heavily on its
                            friends. Most of all, we must have the cooperation of the Governments
                            and the peoples of Southeast Asia itself. Your Government has been most
                            closely associated with mine in this effort, and together we have
                            achieved a great deal to defeat the Communist threat to Southeast Asia.
                            It is my earnest hope that you will instruct your representatives at
                            Geneva to continue this fruitful cooperation there by helping us to
                            establish a truly neutral Laos.</p>
                        <p>The Geneva conference cannot fully succeed without your help. I am
                            convinced that failure at Geneva would have grave consequences for all
                            the people of Southeast Asia.”</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Here is a way of getting a sharper picture of how we're doing in Vietnam.
                            The “way” uses the largest U.S. resources in Vietnam. Defense resources
                            under your control.</p>
                        <p>Attached are a list of questions. Most of them concern the “x-factors” of
                            the real war in Vietnam. Some are vital to true measurements, others are
                            significant as collateral. They are in addition to basic needs on enemy
                            order-of-battle, casualties, lost weapons, etc.</p>
                        <p>Inexpert use of these questions in Vietnam can be harmful to our cause.
                            If they become widely known among Vietnamese, as being of real official
                            concern to the U.S. military, the Vietnamese could take this as a U.S.
                            loss of faith in the Vietnamese armed forces, government, or people;
                            they could open a bad, political Pandora's box among Vietnamese or in
                            our relations with them.</p>
                        <p>Thus, it is recommended that the questions be used in the following
                            way:</p>
                        <p>a. The use of the questions should be a staff function of MAC-V; General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> could have a
                            small team (2 or 3 U.S. military) to handle this; they should be good
                            listeners, good writers, who know Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>b. The questions should be asked only of Americans who have been out in
                            the field, who have had first-hand experience, and who are judged to
                            have gotten close to the Vietnamese; out of thousands of Americans, 50
                            or 100 might be selected; this should be repeated periodically.</p>
                        <p>c. The questions should be asked at a time and place where these “field
                            Americans” can reflect upon them amply; if our best Americans in the
                            field are given brief R&amp;R leaves in Saigon, Dalat, Hongkong,
                            Clark, or Baguio, it would be wise to add extra time and then question
                            them there.</p>
                        <pb n="507" xml:id="pg_507" facs="0527"/>
                        <p>d. The questioners should do the work, not those questioned; verbal give
                            and take can get better results than making field men write down what
                            they know.</p>
                        <p>e. Since conditions vary from locality to locality, it is important to
                            get a geographic fix on each locality reported upon; results could be
                            translated on charts or maps, after analysis; every significant locality
                            should be reported on.</p>
                        <p>In Vietnam, we are up against an enemy who uses Mao Tse-tung's tactics.
                            The text-book rule of imposing our will on enemy forces needs further
                            interpretation. The real contest is to win over the people on the land,
                            which includes protecting them. My questions are to this point.</p>

                            arduous struggle for it. Based as it is on these facts, our policy
                            toward Viet-Nam must and will continue as it has since my administration
                            took office. We have helped and shall continue to help your country to
                            defend itself. We believe your efforts have been and will continue to be
                            increasingly effective. We believe the Vietnamese will defeat communist
                            aggression and subversion.</p>
                        <p>In Laos, the circumstances are quite different. Because of that country's
                            location and because of the conditions in which its people find
                            themselves, the United States believes that a neutral government,
                            committed to neither the west nor the east, is most likely to succeed in
                            providing the Lao people with peace and freedom. We are supported in
                            this belief by most of the free world governments.</p>
                        <p>In negotiating with the communists to achieve a free and neutral Laos, we
                            have not been unmindful of the relationship between Laos and the
                            security of its neighbors. We have sought to build adequate safeguards
                            into the Laos settlement, including assurance Lao territory <pb n="512" xml:id="pg_512" facs="0532"/>will not be used for military or
                            subversive interference in the affairs of other countries. We are aware
                            of the danger that the communists will not honor their pledges. But the
                            only alternative to a neutral Laos appears to be making an international
                            battleground of Laos. This would not help the Lao people and it would
                            not contribute to the security of Laos' neighbors.</p>
                        <p>I am informed that the Geneva negotiations have reached the point where
                            the agreements which have been hammered out over the past thirteen
                            months are nearly ready for signature. In considering the position of
                            our government at this juncture I think it is important for us to keep
                            firmly in mind the real political foundation upon which these agreements
                            rest.</p>
                        <p>When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> and I met in
                            Vienna last year,<note n="3" xml:id="d238fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> met at Vienna, June 3-4,
                                1961.</note> we were able to agree on only one of the many issues
                            which divide us. This was our mutual desire to work for a free,
                            independent and neutral Laos. The result has been that the Soviets, as
                            one of the Co-chairmen, have undertaken an international responsibility
                            under the Geneva Accords to assure the compliance of the communist
                            signatories with the terms of those accords. This responsibility will be
                            tested soon as the agreements are signed.</p>
                        <p>In return for these undertakings by the Soviets, both your delegation and
                            mine have made some concessions in the course of the thirteen months of
                            negotiations. These concessions are the result of the almost complete
                            ineffectiveness of the Royal Laotian Army, as demonstrated again in the
                            recent action at Nam Tha. It is only the threat of American intervention
                            that has enabled us to come as far as we have in Laos. But I hope you
                            agree with me that considering this deteriorating situation the
                            safeguards built into the Laos settlement give us the best hope of
                            future improvement against continuing communist military encroachment
                            through that country.</p>
                        <p>It is in this lilt [<hi rend="italic">light</hi>] that I hope you will
                            reconsider the wisdom of insisting upon a solution of the problem of
                            diplomatic recognition by Laos as a condition for your signature of the
                            Geneva Accords. I recognize the importance of the question and
                            particularly the problem it may create in other countries. On the other
                            hand, I believe that when it is compared with the change of achieving a
                            viable settlement of the Laos problem, the question of the type of
                            representation in Vientiane should not be allowed to determine your
                            country's attitude toward our mutual effort at Geneva.</p>
                        <p>I hope you will instruct your delegation not to raise issues on which
                            general agreement had been reached last December, nor to bring up new
                            issues. It is unrealistic to expect that other countries will undertake
                            obligations to your nation unless your government, through <pb n="513" xml:id="pg_513" facs="0533"/>its signature of these accords, assumes
                            reciprocal obligations. That is why I urge you most earnestly to
                            continue your help in making it possible for the Geneva Accords to be
                            signed promptly by all the participants.</p>
                        <p>In working to ensure peace and freedom for the people of Southeast Asia,
                            the United States must, of course, depend heavily on its friends. Most
                            of all, we must have the cooperation of the governments and the peoples
                            of Southeast Asia itself. Your government has been most closely
                            associated with mine in this effort, and together we have achieved a
                            great deal to defeat the communist threat to Southeast Asia. It is my
                            earnest hope that we may continue this fruitful cooperation by working
                            together to establish a truly neutral Laos.”</p>
                        <p>In presenting letter you should stress in strongest terms the importance
                            we attach to Vietnamese help in reaching Laos settlement, safeguards we
                            have in Russian promises and which we building into settlement itself
                            and our determination continue help Viet-Nam defend itself.</p>

                            clearly has impression that we have thus far been less sympathetic on

                        <p>I asked <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> whether this meant
                            that <persName corresp="#p_VVM1">Mau</persName> was “back in business"
                            at Geneva. He would be, <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>
                            said, once clarifications referred to para 2 above had been received.
                            Without saying so in terms, he gave me clear impression that <persName corresp="#p_VVM1">Mau</persName> would be instructed to sign
                            agreements. With regard to “clarification", I think <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will no longer insist on proposing
                            amendments to agreements. They do want reassurance that <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> will have responsibility and authority
                            to supervise and control <pb n="515" xml:id="pg_515" facs="0535"/>exodus
                            of Viet Minh military personnel. It is important, I believe, that
                                <persName corresp="#p_VVM1">Mau</persName> be given all possible
                            help by <gloss target="#t_USDel1">USDel</gloss> Geneva in reassuring his
                            government on this point and other provisions for enforcement of
                            agreement. Re recognition, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is not
                            asking that we obtain <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> commitment not
                            to recognize <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. They do, however, want
                            us to indicate sympathy with their problem and to indicate interest in
                            finding some more palatable solution than full recognition <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. Again, I think it will be most helpful
                            if Mau can report that we are working along these lines with French and
                            British.</p>
                        <p>In sum, I cannot guarantee that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is
                            now back on tracks and prepared to sign up. However, I believe that
                            there is better than even chance that rather bewildering developments
                            today represent an effort to save face. I urge that <gloss target="#t_USDel1">USDel</gloss> Geneva deal with <persName corresp="#p_VVM1">Mau</persName> on this hypothesis.</p>

                                    <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>' conversation with
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> at 11 a.m. on July 11
                                has been found.</note> I have carefully considered the mission to
                            Southeast Asia which you suggested I undertake. My conclusions are as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>1. It is important that something of this kind be undertaken soon.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Averell</persName> could do it well
                            himself if he could be spared. However, if you, the President and
                            Averell want me to make the tap, I will be happy to do so.</p>
                        <p>2. However, if the purpose of the mission is no more than a series of
                            vague discussions with Southeast Asian leaders I doubt that it could be
                            particularly productive. I have already made two taps to the area during
                            the past nine months<note n="3" xml:id="d241fn3">On the first trip,
                                November 7-19, 1961, <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>
                                visited Japan, Malaysia, and Indonesia; on the second, February
                                8-March 19, 1962, he toured the Middle East, Africa, South Asia, and
                                the Far East.</note> and have had extensive conversations with

                        <p>We are well aware of their thinking on most major issues and they are
                            aware of and sympathetic to my personal views. It would be a mistake for
                            me to return so soon unless my visit is given a specific purpose which
                            we and they understand.</p>
                        <p>3. My memorandum of June 13th<note n="4" xml:id="d241fn4">
                                <ref target="#d214">Document 214</ref>.</note> on “The Need for a
                            Definition of U.S. Political Objectives in Southeast Asia" may provide
                            the solid terms of reference which would give the mission both purpose
                            and promise.</p>
                        <p>In this memorandum I sketched the heavy cost, in time of an armed
                            conflict (which can be graphically illustrated from our own history), of
                            failing to develop an appealing and realistic set of <hi rend="italic">political-economic</hi> objectives to define the purpose for which
                            we are fighting.</p>
                        <p>I urged therefore that we publicly clarify our long-range objectives for
                            Southeast Asia in terms that transcend our present military image in
                            that area and which will appeal to the widest possible spectrum of
                            non-Communist people and governments.</p>
                        <pb n="517" xml:id="pg_517" facs="0537"/>
                        <p>If we can reach agreement among ourselves and with the various Southeast
                            Asian leaders on economic and political goals for the area and publicize
                            these goals in every village and community we could expect three <hi rend="italic">minimum</hi> results:</p>
                        <p>a. We would secure the political initiative and therefore strengthen our
                            basic position and influence.</p>
                        <p>b. We would ease much of the criticism of our present alleged support for
                            the status-quo</p>
                        <p>c. We would undercut the Viet Cong-Communist claim that we are seeking to
                            recapture the French colonial position.</p>
                        <p>As a <hi rend="italic">maximum</hi>, we might begin to isolate Communist
                            insurgents from political support in the region and thereby greatly ease
                            our military problem in dealing with them.</p>
                        <p>For the longer haul such an effort could lay the basis for a politically
                            viable, non-Communist Southeast Asia, able and willing to defend itself
                            against internal subversion and protected against overt aggression by
                            great power guarantees.</p>
                        <p>4. If you and the President accept the basic premises of my memorandum I
                            would like to work out with <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> and Policy
                            Planning, on an urgent basis, an outline of an appealing set of
                            political-economic objectives for the region in the form of a proposed
                            “Charter for a Free and Independent Southeast Asia".</p>
                        <p>I suggest that I then discuss the confidential draft outline on an
                            off-the-record basis with the leaders of the seven Southeast Asian
                            states (excluding Laos). On my return the “Charter" could be revamped in
                            line with these discussions and our own views and launched in the form
                            of a public statement by the President.</p>
                        <p>5. I believe that my first stop should be Manila, where I am confident
                            these proposals will encounter a favorable response which will be
                            helpful in some of the other capitals.</p>
                        <p>Going first to Manila on such a mission would also help improve our
                            bilateral relations with the Philippines.</p>
                        <p>My last stop would be Burma. In order to avoid giving undue weight to our
                            current uncertainties about Ne Win, it can be treated as only one of
                            seven stops on the trip. While in Rangoon, I can perhaps also be of some
                            assistance in other matters.</p>
                        <p>6. If you wish me to undertake this project, I would prefer to leave
                            within ten days for two reasons: first, delay in preparations will risk
                            leaks which might undercut the mission; and the second, I have some long
                            standing important personal commitments between August 18 and September
                            8 which I am anxious to meet if it is possible.</p>
                        <p>If <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss> can work with me on the preparations on a crash basis,
                            I could be ready to leave Washington no later than July 20. I would hope
                            to take with me a qualified regional expert from <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> as well as one of my own assistants.</p>
                        <pb n="518" xml:id="pg_518" facs="0538"/>
                        <p>7. Attached is a <hi rend="italic">very rough preliminary draft</hi>
                            outline of the concept which I might discuss with the Southeast Asian
                            leaders. Obviously it requires careful study and refinement before my
                            departure. It would also be improved by new ideas, deletions or
                            additions that would be suggested by the various Southeast Asian
                            leaders.</p>
                        <p>Although many of the points can be hedged so as not to commit us
                            definitely to institutional arrangements, we need not try to foresee
                            every reservation at this juncture. <persName corresp="#p_WDM1">Wilson</persName>'s Fourteen Points, and Marshall's Harvard address
                            were filled with what seemed at the time to be political utopias.
                            However, they raised visions which in each case turned out to have a
                            profound political impact. Here we have an opportunity to do the
                            same.</p>
                        <p>8. May I add that such a mission, in my opinion, will be welcomed by
                                <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mike Mansfield</persName>, Bill
                            Fulbright, Hubert Humphrey and others of our strongest supporters in
                            Congress who are now deeply concerned by what appears to be our present
                            open end commitment without clear indication of our long-range
                            objectives for Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>This mission, in my opinion, could do much to dear the air here in the
                            United States as well as abroad, and to give us the political initiative
                            in an area where we have been on the defensive ever since the war.</p>

                        <p rend="center">DRAFT PRINCIPLES FOR A PROPOSED SOUTHEAST ASIAN CHARTER</p>
                        <p>1. Achievement of peace throughout Southeast Asia so that the people of
                            each nation may realize their full potential within the framework of
                            their own traditions, cultures, and religions.</p>
                        <p>2. To this end, termination of the guerrilla warfare which is now
                            threatening the independence of South Vietnam, and withdrawal of
                            Vietminh troops north of the 17th parallel.</p>
                        <p>3. Withdrawal, in due course, of all foreign troops from Southeast Asian
                            territories, except those provided at the request of governments to
                            train self-defense forces.</p>
                        <p>4. Broad guarantees by the great powers of the sovereignty, independence,
                            and territorial integrity of the Southeast Asian nations.</p>
                        <p>5. Similar guarantees against all forms of internal subversion, with an
                            inspection system to assure full compliance, so that Southeast Asia may
                            cease to be a battlefield in the Cold War.</p>
                        <p>6. Renunciation of force, in accordance with the United Nations Charter,
                            as an instrument for solving disputes among the nations of Southeast
                            Asia.</p>

                        <p>7. Increased international cooperation for the more rapid development of
                            Southeast Asia's natural and human resources.</p>
                        <p>8. Peaceful resolution, through negotiation, of the dispute between
                            Indonesia and the Netherlands over the status of West New Guinea.</p>
                        <p>9. Preservation of the neutrality of all nations that seek to remain
                            unaligned with any of the great powers.</p>
                        <p>10. Development of the Lower Mekong Basin under an International
                            Authority to increase the industrial capacity of the four riparian
                            states (Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia) and to provide a greatly
                            expanded food supply for distribution through peaceful international
                            trade.</p>
                        <p>11. Similar development of the Irrawaddy River Valley for the benefit of
                            Burma.</p>
                        <p>12. Strengthening of such regional associations as <gloss target="#t_ECAFE1">ECAFE</gloss>, the Asian Productivity
                            Organization, the Colombo Plan Organization, and the Association of
                            Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>13. Creation by the Southeast Asian states of regional production and
                            marketing authorities for the principal staple exports of the region:
                            rice, teak, tin, rubber, jute.</p>
                        <p>14. A comprehensive study of the practicability of a Southeast Asian
                            Common Market.</p>
                        <p>15. Under the aegis of regional associates, creation of regional
                            communications systems, educational institutions, shipping lines, air
                            lines, and industrial development plans for the benefit of the nations
                            of the area.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of these principles, a pledge by the United States
                            Government that on the cessation of hostilities a reasonable proportion
                            of the funds now necessarily devoted to military operations in Vietnam,
                            Laos and Thailand will be devoted to the peaceful economic and social
                            development of the entire area.<note n="5" xml:id="d241fn5">On July 18,

                        <p>In accordance with your request we have examined the available
                            intelligence information related to recent reports on increased
                            Communist infiltration into South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Abstract </p>
                        <p>Communist infiltration into South Vietnam appears to have increased since
                            May 1962, but it is not necessarily related to current developments in
                            Laos. Althou,2h the magnitude of this movement is difficult to assess,
                            it is believed to involve largely well-trained armed cadres and key
                            officials rather than armed units. As in the past, moreover, the
                            movement is confined principally to South Vietnamese (Annamites and
                            Cochinchinese), trained in North Vietnam, rather than North Vietnamese
                            (Tonkinese) who constitute the bulk of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> forces now serving in Laos.</p>
                        <p>Communist infiltration will continue to remain a problem in South
                            Vietnam. The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> has the capability of
                            stepping up infiltration over the present level, if circumstances
                            warrant, with no great difficulty and relatively little danger of
                            detection.</p>
                        <p>American press despatches from Saigon continue to report a sharp step-up
                            in Communist infiltration into South Vietnam from southern Laos. The
                            latest such report, on July 14, 1962, quoted a “US civilian observer"
                            (who was allegedly quoting a “US intelligence adviser") as stating that
                            2,500 to 3,000 Communists “have been streaming like water through a
                            sieve across the border from Laos into South Vietnam" during the past
                            five-week period. Earlier this month, American newsmen reported that US
                            sources agreed with South Vietnamese intelligence estimates that as many
                            as 8,000 to 9,000 Communists may have been infiltrated from Laos. US
                            sources were also quoted as speculating that, “with the pro-Communists
                            firmly in control of the Lao infiltration routes under the new coalition
                            government,” North Vietnamese may be moving more of their estimated
                            10,000 troops in Laos into South Vietnam.</p>

                        <p>The US Military Assistance Command in Vietnam (<gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>) has recently concluded that Communist infiltration
                            into South Vietnam has increased significantly since early May 1962. On
                            June 29, <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> reported that probably
                            800-1,000 Communists had been infiltrated during May and another 800
                            during the first three weeks of June.<note n="2" xml:id="d243fn2">Not
                                further identified.</note> (<gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>
                            infiltration assessments for previous periods are 500-1,000 per month
                            from June through November 1961, and 100-200 per month from December
                            1961 through Apri1 1962.) <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> also
                            reported that the formation of a coalition government in Laos might
                            prompt the North Vietnamese regime to step up infiltration further.</p>
                        <p>On July 5, Embassy Saigon reported that the <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> assessment was based largely on unconfirmed
                            information, that forces infiltrated were mostly well-trained cadres and
                            key officials, and that the infiltration pattern was not related to the
                            formation of a coalition government in Laos.<note n="3" xml:id="d243fn3">Transmitted in telegram 15 from Saigon; Department of State,

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recent Increase in Infiltration Evident</p>
                        <p>Despite the paucity of confirmed reports, the <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> assessment of an increase in the infiltration rate
                            appears valid. First, the increase in the number of unconfirmed reports
                            on infiltration during the past two months cannot be ignored. Second,
                            there is at least one confirmed report of the crossing of a 200-man
                            Communist unit into Kontum province from Laos on May 6-7, 1962. Third,
                            Communist control of the border area in southern Laos has improved. And
                            fourth, the increased aggressiveness and mobility of the South
                            Vietnamese Government forces has begun to hurt the Viet Cong, and the
                            North Vietnamese authorities may now feel that they must quickly
                            strengthen the position of the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>It is difficult, however, to accept the reliability of the statistics—and
                            therefore the magnitude of the increase—in <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>'s assessment Virtually all such information comes from
                            Vietnamese intelligence sources which tend to overstate the infiltration
                            factor. Moreover, South Vietnamese patrolling of the Laos frontier,
                            which could constitute an important means of collecting or confirming
                            intelligence on the Viet Cong in that area, has been very limited.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Laos Developments Probably Unrelated</p>
                        <p>It does not necessarily follow, as apparently some American press and
                            even US military (as well as official Vietnamese) sources suggest that
                            the step-up in infiltration is related to recent developments in <pb n="523" xml:id="pg_523" facs="0543"/>Laos which have resulted in the
                            freeing of Vietnamese Communist forces there for use in South Vietnam.
                            The Communist forces infiltrated into South Vietnam are believed to be
                            almost entirely Cochinchinese and Annamites, the same stock as the
                            people who constitute the bulk of the South Vietnamese peasantry; on the
                            other hand, the Vietnamese Communist forces serving in Laos are largely
                            Tonkinese. The deployment of Vietnamese Communist armed forces in Laos
                            to the South Vietnamese theater, therefore, would go counter to a basic
                            Communist tactic which has heretofore proved effective in South Vietnam
                            in building up an apparatus from personnel native to this area, familiar
                            with local conditions and terrain, and closely identified with the local
                            populace.</p>
                        <p>There are other reasons which do not favor the deployment of Vietnamese
                            Communist forces fighting in Laos into South Vietnam. There is a certain
                            amount of mutual distrust among the Annamites, Cochinchinese, and
                            Tonkinese, and some problems in integrating these forces could be
                            expected. Moreover, the capture of Tonkinese personnel would destroy
                            North Vietnam's propaganda claim that the Viet Cong insurgency is
                            entirely a movement of the South Vietnamese people.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusions</p>
                        <p>On the basis of available intelligence information, we conclude that</p>
                        <p>1. there has probably been an increase in the infiltration of Communist
                            personnel into South Vietnam during the past two months;</p>
                        <p>2. it is difficult to assess the magnitude of this movement;</p>
                        <p>3. the increase in infiltration probably is not related to recent
                            developments in Laos;</p>
                        <p>4. it appears unlikely that North Vietnamese or Pathet Lao forces in Laos
                            would be committed to South Vietnam at this time; and</p>
                        <p>5. North Vietnam has the capacity to step up infiltration further, if the
                            situation warrants, with relatively little detection and no great
                            difficulty.</p>

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> then told
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> that, following
                            their recent meeting, he and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> had sent a message to Washington on the subject
                            of crop warfare and defoliation. No answer had yet been received
                            concerning the crop warfare portion of their message, but he hoped that
                            the matter would be discussed in Hawaii. Permission has been received to
                            carry out defoliation operations at Bien Hoa.</p>
                        <p>Since his arrival, the General said, much progress has been made. The
                            number of advisors has increased. There are now advisors down to
                            battalion level, and during the month that they have been there, they
                            have come to know their counterparts and have established a good
                            relationship with them.</p>
                        <p>Intelligence advisors are now working down at Sector level. Their
                            communications have been installed and the reports that are now coming
                            in are much improved. On the subject of communications, the General
                            added that all divisions now have good equipment. In two <pb n="525" xml:id="pg_525" facs="0545"/>months, air-ground coordination will be
                            much improved by the completion of installation of new equipment in
                            aircraft. On 1 September the backbone of the tropo-scatter system will
                            be completed. The new airfield at Pleiku is finished and would be tested
                            this same day. In reply to a question from the President, General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> said that the
                            runway was some 6,500 feet long. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> next expressed his satisfaction that we now have
                            M-113's and M-114's in the country and that a promise has been made that
                            150 more amphibious vehicles would be expedited from the United States
                            and would be here by next Spring. He said that he had requested three
                            more helicopter companies and had been told that he would receive two.
                            The President commented that two would be very good, but that three
                            would be better. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> pointed out that what he said up to this point
                            was all for the good, and added that training will be completed for the
                            Civil Guard by the end of the year and for the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> by February or March. The President interjected the
                            remark that he considered General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> to be somewhat optimistic. The General went on
                            to say that the system of rotation of units for the purpose of
                            retraining them was continuing. The President commented that he saw the
                            necessity of doing this but that he regretted that the procedure created
                            a void. After pointing out the necessity of training, General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> repeated that these were
                            all points for the good.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> then said that
                            during the preceding week he had visited all the divisions. Everywhere
                            it had been reported that there was a serious shortage of company grade
                            officers. In some instances there were only six officers in a battalion.
                            There were instances of companies commanded by aspirants or sergeants.
                            Leadership, he added, was lacking in platoons and companies, the very
                            place where it is needed most—since these are the units which do the
                            fighting. He said that in July there would be some 1500 officers
                            graduating from training school. This will help some, but it would be
                            another six months before any more could be obtained. He told the
                            President that he had checked with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> and General Ty to see if any young officers were
                            surplus in headquarters or in logistic commands and could be freed for
                            service with fighting units which needed them most and were shortest in
                            personnel. The President told General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> that he agreed with him completely.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> then said that
                            he had been informed that some aspirants and other officers, up to
                            major, had been in grade for 3, 4 and 5 years. He felt that selective
                            promotions could be of definite help. The President replied that last
                            year he had reviewed the entire list of officers. Priority of promotion
                            had been given to combat men. In order that they would understand that
                            the selection of those to be promoted was a serious thing, the President
                            had waited several months before announcing the selections. However,
                            when the promotions were <pb n="526" xml:id="pg_526" facs="0546"/>made,
                            the date of rank was made retroactive to November 1961. He then added
                            that he was concerned over the number of senior officers who have
                            reached the height of their potential and who lack the education and
                            initiative required in higher grades. In response to General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>' remark that such men
                            should be eliminated, the President commented that the situation had
                            been inherited from the French, who were too easy and had made colonels
                            and lieutenant colonels who had no real capability or training. He was
                            considering the thought of elimination. General Harkin's suggested that
                            there might be an examination given and that those who failed to qualify
                            would be eliminated. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> commented that one of the difficulties in
                            identifying incompetent officers lies in the fact that his Generals do
                            not want to recommend separation of officers who are old friends.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> then
                            commented that promotions have a great effect on morale.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> then referred
                            to the ambush which had taken place on the preceding Saturday and asked
                            the President what he thought had happened to the leadership of his
                            paratroopers. An hour after the attack, the survivors were still
                            standing around without having taken any counter action. He reminded the
                            President that the force had consisted of 270 men, of whom 20 were
                            killed, but the other 250 did nothing. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> said that he had been informed of
                            this and was greatly concerned over it. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> said that he felt this to
                            be an example of the lack of junior leadership. He said that he could
                            understand the Civil Guard and Self Defense Corps had been a
                            considerable drain on the regular forces, but he felt that some way had
                            to be found to get more officers. He suggested that the course at the
                            military academy might be temporarily reduced. The President said that
                            he had contemplated this and thought perhaps three years would be
                            temporarily acceptable. He felt that a two-year course would be too
                            short. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> said
                            that during World War I the course at the U.S. Military Academy had been
                            reduced to two years although in World War II the reduction had been
                            only to three years. He added that although he felt that the situation
                            warrants a temporary reduction in the length of the course, he was in
                            favor of keeping a core of career officers. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> told the President that in
                            World War I the U.S. Army had been expanded to 5 million men and in
                            World War II to 8 million men. The officer strength had been built up by
                            taking specialists from civilian life and giving them 90 days of
                            training. These men were engineers, mechanics, police and other
                            professional types. The President said that he would discuss the matter
                            with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> and review the
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> then told
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> that he felt that,
                            rather than have large 6 or 7 battalion operations, covering 80 square
                            kilometers, which resulted sometimes in the capture of as little as two
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>,<pb n="527" xml:id="pg_527" facs="0547"/> better results could be obtained from smaller
                            battalion sized operations based on good intelligence and carried out
                            with speed, under the greatest possible secrecy. Such an operation had
                            been carried out by Colonel Khien in Ba Xuyen and had resulted in 20
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> killed and 200 captured. This,
                            said General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>, he
                            considered to be an outstanding operation. In large operations troops
                            must move on the preceding day and, consequently, the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> is alerted and disappears. President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> agreed completely with
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> then said that
                            Zone D, where there are reported to be many <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, would be a good place for the specially trained and
                            equipped units to go in and stay for a couple weeks or more. The
                            President said that this was precisely what he wanted to talk to the
                            General about. The General continued by repeating that the units must
                            stay out on operations and not go out and return the same day. He said
                            that supply of the units would not be difficult. He stressed that the
                            only way to win is to attack, attack, attack. He then spoke of General
                            Khan's plan to reorganize the Ranger companies into battalions with a
                            Montagnard company assigned as scouts, somewhat like the American
                            Indians of yore. The President agreed that reorganization of this type
                            is most important.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> then asked the
                            President if he could give him some information on the overall plan for
                            the establishment of strategic hamlets. He said that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> would surely question him on
                            the subject for the purpose of establishing his plans for the provision
                            of necessary supplies and equipment. He asked if the national plan has
                            been prepared and stated that he realized that there were strategic
                            hamlets in Phu Yen, Binh Duong, Kien Hoa, in fact—everywhere, and added
                            that he liked what he had seen. He asked the President if he could give
                            him some idea of the number of hamlets which were planned for the next
                            month, or the next two or three months, in order to permit orderly
                            planning. He knew, he said, of no National Plan except an order of
                            magnitude which gave the figure of some 7,000 per year. The President
                            indicated that he was aware of the requirement but said that there were
                            many difficulties which he would attempt to explain. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> then told the President
                            that he knew of the recent decree which assigned responsibility for the
                            program to division commanders. He added that this procedure would
                            require a certain amount of time for the formulation of plans. He said
                            that he felt that hamlets were not needed everywhere and added that
                            advance planning was necessary in order to permit time for training of
                            cadres and to obtain the necessary materials. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> commented that he realized that
                            this project is an expensive one and that, as for many other projects,
                            money is the main problem. He added that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> must give strong support to
                            the program. General <pb n="528" xml:id="pg_528" facs="0548"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> said that Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> would be able to
                            give it stronger support if he were provided some sort of plan to be
                            used as a talking point.</p>
                        <p>Speaking on the general conduct of the war, General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> said that he thought there
                            should be greater use made of the Air Force, citing that no activities
                            had been reported for the previous day. There is now plenty of air
                            support in Vietnam. Targets should be located by intelligence and free
                            areas defined. Where an area is known to be <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> controlled it might be a good idea to warn the people by
                            means of pamphlets that they must leave. If they refuse to leave then we
                            could assume the village was <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> controlled. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> next spoke of some 15 to 20
                            naval vessels which are sitting at docks in Vietnam unmanned. Little
                            river craft, in particular, could help much in operations. He next said
                            that there should be greater coordination of activities. The Joint
                            General Staff, Field Command, the Corps, and the Divisions, as well as
                            the Army, Navy and Air Force, should all work in coordination. There
                            should be somebody directly responsible for the war. This might be Field
                            Command, who could be the coordinator but need not necessarily run all
                            operations. As an example of lack of coordination, General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> referred to the ambush at
                            Ben Cat saying that if they had been notified, the Air Force could have
                            provided cover for the operation and there probably would have been no
                            ambush. The President commented that the unit involved was
                            overconfident.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> next said that
                            war is not all military and that the military should help in civic
                            actions such as building bridges, digging wells, providing medical
                            assistance to the people, etc. This would contribute greatly toward
                            winning the people over to the side of the government. President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> replied that until
                            1955-56 the Armed Forces were very actively engaged in such activities
                            but with the reorganization of forces into Corps there was no longer any
                            possibility of doing this. Now division commanders say that they have no
                            time and no personnel for this sort of thing. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> suggested that troops on
                            static jobs in defense of key villages, industries, dams and bridges,
                            might find time to participate in a civic action program. For instance,
                            the officers might teach school; the troops could build roads across the
                            dikes, or dams in the paddies. The President replied that all his
                            commanders had said that the troops were very limited and they could not
                            be distracted from their primary duties. It was essential that they stay
                            alert against possible attack at any moment. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> said that the U.S. forces
                            had done a great deal of work with the people in Korea and had won over
                            their hearts and their minds.</p>
                        <p>(At this point the meeting was interrupted by the arrival of the
                            President's Aide with a note.) President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>, referring to the paper which had been given to
                            him, said that he had just received good news; <pb n="529" xml:id="pg_529" facs="0549"/>that in a paratroop operation near Binh
                            Duong two radios had been seized. Also, in the swamp area the Marines
                            had seized a radio receiver, a public address system, a mimeograph
                            machine and a tape recorder. The President added that there was also
                            news of the fact that two of the Americans who had crashed in the C-123
                            had been found and that the search for the others still continued. He
                            said that he was summoning General Khan, who should have further
                            details. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>
                            expressed his pleasure of the operation and suggested that the battalion
                            involved should stay in the area until Sunday to seek out and destroy
                            the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> once again
                            referred to the successful civic action program of the Armed Forces in
                            Korea. He said that he recognized the fact that the situation is
                            different here in Vietnam but that he hoped that units would do whatever
                            they could wherever they could. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> agreed that they would. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> then suggested that
                            companies assigned to static duties be rotated at three months
                            intervals, otherwise they lose the benefit of their training and tend to
                            develop static thinking habits. As an after-thought, the President said
                            that the Self Defense Corps in the center of the country was doing a
                            great deal to help the people, particularly in building their houses.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> said that
                            this sort of close relationship with the people was very valuable and
                            that if the populace is not treated properly by the military there was
                            danger that the people would be resentful and possibly look to the side
                            of the enemy for help.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> then said that
                            he thought that the training program in Vietnam was going along very
                            well. He added that he had instructed his advisors to continue the
                            training, particularly in shooting rifles, pistols, and mortars whenever
                            units were in an inactive status. He next said. that we now have a good
                            intelligence system which needs only to be coordinated so that the
                            sectors, the provinces and the military units would receive the same
                            information. With good intelligence and the new mobility, a policy of
                            constant rapid attack is bound to beat the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. He said that he that he was proud of the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> forces and that he only wanted to see
                            more initiative taken. Here, in conclusion, he said, were some of his
                            observations which he would report to Hawaii. In answer to the classic
                            question: “Are we winning or losing?" he could tell them that we are not
                            losing the war. It is true that the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> forces are still in a training phase and that the
                            Civil Guard and <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> won't be fully
                            available to relieve regular forces before the end of the year, but he
                            still felt that by exerting constant pressure, by full use of the Air
                            Force, ground forces, the Rangers and Special Forces, the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> could be cleared out. He concluded by
                            saying that he was pleased to see the large number of Montagnards who
                            were coming over to the side of the government. He then asked how he
                            could help the President.</p>
                        <pb n="530" xml:id="pg_530" facs="0550"/>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> said that he would
                            like General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> to make
                            one thing understood to the Vietnamese senior officers, the Corps and
                            Division Commanders, as well as the Joint General Staff, and that is
                            that General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>'
                            headquarters is not running the war. He said that President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> had explained carefully to the
                            Congress of the United States and to the entire world that the Americans
                            were in Vietnam to advise and to assist. His senior commanders should
                            understand that they should not expect the Americans to plan for them,
                            or to issue orders. Some of his officers seemed to feel that if they
                            told their American counterparts what they proposed to do, they then had
                            to wait for agreement before they could carry out their plans. The
                            President said that he wanted them to take their own actions. It was
                            very well to receive information and advice and if the advisors did not
                            agree with the commanders, there should be a discussion of the
                            differences and, if necessary, an appeal through channels for a decision
                            from higher command. Then they should act on their own initiative. Too
                            many officers have a background of service with the French. It is time
                            that they realized that the Americans in Vietnam are not a French
                            expeditionary force. They need equipment and material which they must
                            get from the Americans, but they must not expect plans and commands.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> said that his
                            headquarters is here to advise only, not to command. The President
                            repeated that the General must tell the Vietnamese military that the
                            initiative in waging the war belongs to the Vietnamese. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> told the
                            President that he agreed with this and that, in fact, President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> is really the
                            Commander-in-Chief. He added that many of the division and regimental
                            commanders were young men who were shouldering great responsibilities.
                            He said that they were acquiring experience and added that the American
                            advisors, who have experience, attempt to pass this experience on to
                            their Vietnamese counterparts by making suggestions to them. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> said that his
                            heart goes out to these young men who, under the President's guidance,
                            are working so hard to free their country. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> then said that his judgment of the
                            officers is rather severe. Two years of war have brought maturity to
                            some Army personnel serving as province and district chiefs. Many show
                            great promise for the future. Some are very good and have stood up under
                            test. He told General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>, that, before the General's arrival, visitors who
                            had made a tour of the country and had seen some of the military
                            commanders had given him very glowing reports on the fine military
                            bearing of some of these officers. He added that unfortunately his
                            scepticism, in some instances, had been justified because, when under
                            trial, some of these officers have proven that this was all superficial
                            and that in fact they were incapable. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> went on to say that since a few
                            months before the arrival of General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> he had allowed complete initiative to his
                            commanders. There <pb n="531" xml:id="pg_531" facs="0551"/>had been some
                            instances, where, because of special information which he had received,
                            he had issued direct instructions to commanders to be careful or to
                            watch a particular situation closely. He said that command initiative
                            was now so much a function of his military leaders that they rarely
                            inform him anymore of any action they intend to take. He said that he
                            permitted this in order to assess their capabilities. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> said that, with reference
                            to the President's comment about his officers' French background, he
                            wanted to point out that the French concept was different from the
                            American. He said that they had been strongly influenced by the Maginot
                            Line concept. The only effect produced by this is that the enemy knows
                            where you are. He added that he would like to see units go out on
                            operations more often and to stay out for periods of three to four
                            weeks. Every unit, he said, needs to have a few victories under its
                            belt. It has to get out and kill the enemy.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he had wanted to talk to General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> about an idea which he
                            referred to as “Cutting the Forest.” He would like to set up special
                            small units to go deep into the jungle and set up ambushes along known
                            or suspected trails. These units would stay away from the isolated
                            villages because otherwise they would be betrayed to the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> who could then find them and destroy
                            them. They would be responsible for obtaining their own information and
                            would remain for periods of at least a month. The Chief of the Phuoc
                            Long Province had told him that, contrary to common belief, the troops
                            did not get sick when they stayed in the woods for prolonged periods of
                            time. They got ill when they returned to the outside. First, their wives
                            fed them too well, and secondly, they failed to purge in order to
                            destroy the effect of the water which they had drunk while in the woods.
                            The President spoke very highly of the Phuoc Long Province Chief, saying
                            that he went out on deep operations two or three times each week and was
                            the only one who knew how to use the Montagnards. In an answer to
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>' question,
                            the President said that the Province Chief had obtained valuable
                            intelligence through his operations but that Field Command did not give
                            him proper credit for the information which he had submitted. The
                            President said that one major operation which resulted in the capture of
                            a certain amount of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> material had been
                            carried out on the basis of information supplied by this man. The
                            operation failed to trap any <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. This was
                            because Field Command and Colonel Tranh (5th Division C.O.) had thought
                            that helicopters and paratroops were all that would be needed to carry
                            out the operation. This, said the President, was stupid because there
                            are no drop zones in this densely overgrown area. The Province Chief had
                            suggested a joint operation on the ground which certainly would have
                            produced far better results.</p>
                        <pb n="532" xml:id="pg_532" facs="0552"/>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> next told General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> that he had seen
                            the U.K. Undersecretary, Mr. Amery, who is a flier and well-versed in
                            air actions against guerrillas. This man had said that the use of
                            helicopters in counter-subversive activities was a fairly new idea and
                            that no doctrine had yet been developed. He advised that careful study
                            be made and that doctrine be developed through experience.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> then reverted back
                            to the subject of “Cutting the Forest.” He said that these units, like
                            the Montagnards, would not use main trails but would mark their routes
                            by breaking inconspicuous little twigs which would not be detected by
                            the enemy. These units should be most effective during the rainy season
                            when it is easier to set up ambushes than it is during the dry season.
                            Too many military leaders, with their routine thinking, have the idea
                            that the rainy season means the dead season as far as operations are
                            concerned. This idea is completely false. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> agreed wholeheartedly with
                            the President and said that he had instructed his advisors to find ways
                            of keeping actions going during the rainy season. The President said
                            that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> was greatly handicapped by
                            the rains. It is very difficult for them to preserve their foodstuffs
                            and, with the constant drizzle and thoughts of families and native
                            villages, morale drops. The President added that the habits of the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are known. They get up at 0400,
                            eat, have a period of physical education, and then disperse. At about
                            1800 they return for their evening meal which is followed by courses in
                            political indoctrination. Obviously, the time to attack is at 0400 in
                            the morning or after 1800 in the evening. The President said that he had
                            discussed this plan with the Chief of the Phuoc Long Province and with
                            Colonel Thong and Lt Colonel Dung, who all agreed that this tactic would
                            pay off, particularly during the rainy season, and each had prepared a
                            rapid study on the subject which the President had consolidated and
                            which he would make available to General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> on the following day. Other military leaders had
                            raised objections to the plan. Some had claimed that since the
                            battalions are already thoroughly understrength men could not be
                            withdrawn to form new units. Leaders could not be spared. If carried out
                            on a large scale, this plan could disorganize the Army. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> said that he
                            thought it should be tried. The President said that he felt that the men
                            selected for this program should be given some supplementary reward. He
                            had talked about this with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>, who agreed but pointed out that it could amount
                            to a sizeable sum of money. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> repeated that he thought the idea should be
                            tried and added that he felt that the men involved should be volunteers.
                            Training would offer no particular problem because of the Special Forces
                            available to do this. With the combination of strategic hamlets and
                            activities such as these, the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> would
                            certainly suffer. He added that the Rangers should go out on sustained
                            operations. The President agreed, saying <pb n="533" xml:id="pg_533" facs="0553"/>that the Rangers, either in company size or
                            reconstituted battalions, could certainly create insecurity for the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and would leave them no bases
                            which they could consider safe havens. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> agreed and said that it was
                            absolutely essential that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> be
                            permitted no permanent base from which they could operate.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> next asked the
                            President how much infiltration he thought there had been during the
                            past month. The President replied that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> had come in in large numbers but he didn't know how
                            many. He referred to the incident regarding the capture of a <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> sergeant in Phaoc Long Province who had
                            spoken freely and revealed that a company composed of cadres had
                            departed from the North in April and had infiltrated into the South.
                            These men were natives of the South who had gone North following the
                            Geneva Accords, had been trained there, and were now returning. The
                            President said that the recent aggressiveness of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> which had resulted in a number of defeats
                            to <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> forces was the result of the
                            desire of newly arrived cadres to show their superiors in the North that
                            the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> in the South were more effective
                            under their leadership. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> commented that the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> soldiers must not be permitted to believe that the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> is 12 feet tall, adding that this
                            had been done to the Americans during World War II when attempts were
                            made to convince them that the Germans were 15 feet tall. President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> said that this was the
                            fault of Western journalists who exaggerate the prowess of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. He added that in order to overcome this,
                            the initiative must be stressed. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> agreed, repeating his earlier statement that
                                <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> must drive constantly
                            against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>At this point Brigadier General Kanh, Colonel Vinh and another paratroop
                            officer arrived with the radio equipment which had been captured earlier
                            in the day. General Kanh said that the two pieces of equipment had been
                            captured in two separate places. There had been no major engagement with
                            the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. He added that the principal radio
                            which had been broadcasting to Saigon-Cholon had been moved northward
                            and that Colonel Thanh was carrying out an operation in that area. There
                            was a brief discussion of the equipment during which it was pointed out
                            that it was handmade and that there was a possibility that some of the
                            parts might have been obtained in Cambodia. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> said that his technical
                            intelligence officer could help to identify the material. General Kanh
                            spoke briefly on the operation, saying that it had been carried out in
                            secrecy and that deception had been used to divert the attention of the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> from the real target. He added
                            that the plan had been formulated and carried out so swiftly that the
                            III Corps Advisor had not been informed of it. He also spoke briefly of
                            a Marine Corps operation carried out the night before which involved two
                            companies using boats. This operation had resulted in the seizure of a
                            battery-powered radio, a mimeograph machine and a <pb n="534" xml:id="pg_534" facs="0554"/>tape recorder. General <persName corresp="#p_NK5">Khanh</persName> then said that the Airborne
                            troops involved in the operation in Binh Duong would be withdrawn and
                            replaced with Special Forces. (General Kanh and the paratroop officers
                            left.)</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> described to
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> a visit which
                            he had made to a Montagnard area near Dalat where 3,000 members of the
                            Koho tribe have been relocated. He expressed satisfaction with the
                            defenses of the settlement, which include fox-holes in each house. The
                            spirit of the tribe was demonstrated on the 29th of June when they
                            wounded two or three Viet Cong who had come to terrorize them. On the
                            occasion of the President's visit they carried out a mock raid with the
                            help of the Civil Guard. The exercise was well performed even to the
                            explosion of grenades to simulate shells which could have been fired
                            from the artillery at the Military Academy. The President also told
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> that he had
                            checked on a report made by some Missionaries that there was a serious
                            shortage of rice. He found that the claims were exaggerated and
                            premature. He had also visited Montagnards near Lake da K'Lac some
                            sixteen kilometers from Ban Me Thuot and had gone from there to see the
                            Montagnards and the Cham near Phan Rang. There, he had exceptionally
                            donated 300,000 piastres to help the people to build their homes. He had
                            wanted to go as far as Dak To but the weather would not permit him to do
                            so. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> told the
                            President that he had recently visited the high plateau and had found
                            that the weather was not good. He mentioned that at Achau he had found
                            mat the battalion stationed there was operating properly, with one
                            company in the fort and two out on patrols. When the President commented
                            that this battalion was too far out and was in fact immobilized, General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> pointed out that
                            they were only 5 kilometers from the Laotian border and were performing
                            useful patrol duty. The President replied that if it were not for the
                            fertile valley which extends from A Luoi the employment of this
                            battalion would constitute a luxury which could not be afforded in view
                            of the general shortage of effectives.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> then said that the
                            first class of “intellectuals" would graduate from Tu Duc at the end of
                            the month. He could not give the General an answer to his question as to
                            how large the class was, but explained that these were the pharmacists,
                            doctors, engineers and other professional men who had been mobilized. He
                            said that, at first, there had been some difficulty because the faculty
                            of the school lacked qualified instructors to discuss cultural subjects,
                            but this had been remedied by having the Commandant of the Military
                            Academy and other competent teachers present special courses several
                            times a week. At this point, the President referred briefly to early
                            attempts, which had been prompted by Secretary of State Dulles, to
                            mobilize the brain-power of the country. The response to an appeal to
                            serve had <pb n="535" xml:id="pg_535" facs="0555"/>been completely
                            negative. When General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> asked if the men who were about to graduate were
                            properly motivated, the President replied that they were, and that
                            Colonel Huyen, the Military School Commandant had done much to help in
                            this. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> then
                            asked if the Colonel had good military training, to which the President
                            replied that Huyen had worked with the General Staff on plans and
                            training for four or five years. He added that, because of his
                            educational background, the Generals detested him and that he had
                            received no vote for promotion during the last review of potential
                            candidates. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>
                            commented that there were many good officers who were not graduates of
                            the Service academies and pointed out that General <persName corresp="#p_DGH1">Decker</persName> and General Marshall were among
                            these.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> was then told
                            that President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> had received
                            a visit from his Artillery Commander. After explaining that he had
                            followed this officer's career closely and that he was a graduate of the
                            Command and General Staff School at Leavenworth, the President said that
                            they had discussed the situation of the 4.2 mortars. He said that this
                            weapon was not being used because it was too heavy and that the roads
                            were not good. He said that there were nine battalions, each equipped
                            with 27 mortars amounting to a total of 243 pieces. Only four hundred
                            rounds had been fired from them. He added that their range is too short
                            and that too many men have been immobilized because of them—in fact the
                            entire personnel of nine battalions. On the other hand, the twelve
                            battalions equipped with 105s were working well. There are a total of
                            156 pieces, twelve in each battalion, and twelve at the Military Academy
                            which are far more effective than the 243 mortars. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> said that he would look
                            into the situation.</p>
                        <p>The President next mentioned the fact that he had talked with the Korean
                            Military Mission prior to their departure. He said that they had made
                            suggestions based on their observations but that most of these were
                            erroneous because the Koreans saw critical areas where there were none.
                            They had no real appreciation of the terrain in Vietnam and saw
                            everything in neat geometric patterns. They did tell the President that
                            there was a great deal more artillery in Korea—to counteract the Soviet
                            concept of mass employment of heavy guns. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> commented that 11,000 tons
                            had been shot in one day while he was in Korea. The President went on to
                            say that the Koreans had made the valid suggestion that the main
                            defenses of strategic hamlets should be out of range of grenade
                            launchers. This could be accomplished by erecting an exterior fence.</p>
                        <p>Next the President said that he had received a visit from the Director
                            General of the Banque of Indo China. This gentlemen, whose main office
                            is now in Paris, had been one of the first to resist the Japanese. He
                            had also followed the Algerian problem carefully and <pb n="536" xml:id="pg_536" facs="0556"/>suggested a system, like that used in
                            Algeria, to protect the high tension transmission lines which would soon
                            be ready for installation from Danh Quan. The President described this
                            system as a very wide swath, many meters across, which would contain a
                            series of barbed-wire obstacles, with the intervening spaces strewn with
                            anti-personnel mines. This system had been completely effective in
                            Algeria and had the advantage of not requiring large numbers of troops.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>, at this
                            point, said that a group of Chinese business men, whose identities were
                            unknown to him, had offered to clear a kilometer wide swath the full
                            length of the border in return for the right to sell the lumber
                            obtained. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>
                            expressed the opinion that transportation problems would be
                            insurmountable, but offered to talk to the men if they asked to see him.
                            He then reverted to the subject of the protection of the high tension
                            lines, saying that most of the pylons were already erected—an average of
                            two per kilometer—and that the cost, $6,000 per kilometer, had been
                            appreciable. With porcelain insulators (General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> indicated how easy it would
                            be to knock them out with high powered rifles) there was a great problem
                            in ensuring security of the lines. The President added that the VC were
                            even beginning to kidnap and harass the Japanese who were in charge of
                            the project.</p>
                        <p>President Diem then told General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> that he had held discussions with Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> over a period of months
                            on the subject of how to economize men. He had finally decided that
                            Field Command should be eliminated. Not only would this afford an
                            economy of personnel but would permit faster reaction time in the
                            execution of orders from the General Staff. It had become obvious to him
                            that the Field Commander was not capable. When General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> said that General <persName corresp="#p_DVMBM1">Minh</persName> was one of the best combat
                            commanders in Vietnam and asked what plans the President had for him,
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> replied that he
                            was giving thought to the matter.</p>
                        <p>When General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> thanked
                            the President for having granted him so much time, President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> said that he would like to
                            continue their discussion. He wanted, he said, to talk about the civil
                            situation in Vietnam. He first outlined briefly the history of education
                            in the country, explaining that it was only from 1920 that the French
                            had set up high schools. In 1930 they added certain University faculties
                            to the educational system. Before the war there were few secondary
                            schools and, of course, during the nine years of war educational
                            facilities were practically non-existent. Since 1954 education in
                            Vietnam has mushroomed. The Vietnamese, who are studious by nature, are
                            rapidly filling the gap in educated people. Foreign observers, said the
                            President, do not understand the evolution which has taken place. Before
                            this regime, only favored children were able to attend moneymaking
                            private schools, or go abroad, to France, for study. From these <pb n="537" xml:id="pg_537" facs="0557"/>came many amateur politicians
                            who gathered around Bao Dai. When President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> took over the reins of government, he accepted the
                            counsel of friends, both Vietnamese and foreign, and included some of
                            these people in his first cabinet. They were not capable and had no
                            credit with the population. When the President formed his second cabinet
                            in September 1954, he said, these people were eliminated. Also, he
                            added, he was urged to accept the participation of representatives of
                            religious sects who, at the time, were nothing but powerful bandits with
                            their own private armies. Their audacity reached the point where they
                            even fired upon officers of the Vietnamese General Staff. It was
                            necessary to suppress them, and this was done. Next, said the President,
                            Mr. Malcolm MacDonald came to give him a lesson about not imposing his
                            ideas too strictly. Even since 1960 there has been constant criticism of
                            the government. This, President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> insisted, is due to the fact that observers are
                            looking at past history. For the past two years, especially, he said,
                            there has been a great change in the younger generation. There are many
                            fine technicians now in government service. The status of the business
                            man has also gone through a great transformation. When the President
                            first took over the government he was told that only the French and the
                            Chinese could hope to obtain bank credits. Officials of <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>, he said, had advised him that if he
                            attempted to wipe out the black market, the Chinese would paralyze the
                            finances of the country. He was told that it was fine to be
                            nationalistic, but without good management he would be running to
                            failure. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>
                            asked at this point where people were now trained for government
                            service. The President replied that a school is now operating for
                            municipal administrative officials and that selections for more
                            important positions are made from the ranks of those best qualified by
                            education and experience. Great strides have been made in the management
                            field. The Chamber of Commerce, now four years old, is doing valuable
                            work. There has been a gradual, but steady build-up in industry and in
                            the import-export trade. Men, who three or four years ago thought of
                            government laws and regulations as pure annoyances, now see that this
                            was normal and in the interest of good order. Opposition today, said the
                            President, is from fossils who are still far behind the actuality, who
                            are still ambitious but who recite stupidities about the subjugation of
                            government officials. The new class of technicians is independent. They
                            discuss the philosophy of the regime and they accept it because it is
                            valid. Ministers are independent and express their own ideas. Among them
                            are relatives of known rebels and of refugees to France. Some of them,
                            when they were invited to join the cabinet, were reluctant to do so.
                            They now present their ideas and certain ones among them are quite
                            stubborn. In addition to this, continued the President, the members of
                            the National Assembly are former judges, lawyers, engineers, doctors and
                            other <pb n="538" xml:id="pg_538" facs="0558"/>professional men who have
                            independent means and do not need to serve. When General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> asked if there were any
                            members of the sects in the Assembly, the President replied that there
                            was a member from Tay Ninh—though not associated with the former
                            bandits.</p>
                        <p>He then insisted that when people formed opinions of the country they did
                            so only in the light of the former officials who lacked professional
                            conscience. These people are no longer in office. There is a new group
                            of younger men, graduates of schools such as the Ecole Polytechnique,
                            who have ideas and who are capable. There is a newly formed National
                            Economic Council which is now holding its second session. They raise and
                            discuss economic problems, and nothing could be better. Still, they are
                            not opposed to the government and they defend national interests.
                            Opinion in America, said the President, is behind the times. The latest
                            report of the Bank of Indo China praises the economic development in
                            Vietnam and points up the progress which has been made and the prestige
                            acquired. Much in the minds of United States Senators is because of
                            their neglect to see the progress made. They must realize that
                            government officials here are independent and have their own ideas. At
                            this point the President apologized for having taken so much of General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>' time and said
                            that he had done so because he had wanted to tell him what the true
                            situation is. He commented that a man's stomach can be quickly filled
                            but that it takes a long time to fill his brain. It is unfortunate, he
                            added, that many people will pay no attention to what is said unless it
                            is bad. He wondered why <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> and others
                            did not put the record straight. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> said that the Embassy had recently published a
                            progress report on Vietnam.<note n="4" xml:id="d244fn4">See <ref target="#d222">Document 222</ref>.</note> The President said
                            that he was aware of this but he deplored the fact that people still
                            listened to disgruntled amateur politicians who had nothing to say about
                            the government which was not contemptuous or otherwise unjust. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> suggested that
                            the President might call some of these people in and talk to them—to
                            which the President replied that it would be useless. They have
                            preconceived ideas and can see only those things which were bad in
                            former days. They refuse to see the thousands of competent men now in
                            service and particularly the thirty or so in the National Assembly who
                            are moral, patriotic and independent in their thinking. Those who judge
                            by what they hear from malcontents and plotters merely encourage these
                            unbalanced minds. The President then went on to say that last year, at
                            the time of the floods, he had accepted Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>'s suggestion that some of the
                            people who were critical of the government be invited to serve on a
                            flood relief committee. Even though he considered them to be incapable,
                            they had been invited to serve. It soon became obvious that they didn't
                            want to leave <pb n="539" xml:id="pg_539" facs="0559"/>Saigon because of
                            the danger to their persons. These were the people who formed the
                            opposition to the government—who uttered vague criticism but had nothing
                            constructive to contribute. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> said that the first question that he asked of
                            any member of the press who came to see him was whether or not he had
                            been anywhere in Vietnam outside of Saigon. The answer was usually
                            “no".</p>

                            approach from that suggested <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>.
                            As Dept aware, Task Force some time ago agreed on geographically phased
                            counterinsurgency program including priorities (Emb despatch 429).<note n="3" xml:id="d245fn3">See <ref target="#d11fn1">footnote 1,

                            advice to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> on Strategic Hamlet
                            Program and in deciding allocation of US resources to specific clear and
                            hold operations. Believe we now have more effective means of applying
                            these priorities de facto to ongoing Strategic Hamlet Program. With
                            establishment US owned piaster fund and <gloss target="#t_PA1">PA</gloss>/PR for dollar procurement, we should have carrot with
                            which to induce <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to come up with
                            coordinated clear and hold operations in those areas which we regard as
                            having highest priority. If this approach works, effect will be to apply
                            bulk of resources and effort in highest priority areas. Through
                            experience we should also be able to develop more accurate programming
                            justifications.</p>
                        <p>This approach will not result in slowing down or stopping Strategic
                            Hamlet Program in non-priority areas. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is firmly and publicly committed to pushing program on
                            nation-wide basis. While this is bound to result in some failures, we do
                            not think that there is any substantial risk that these will be “fatal
                            to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>”. Our impression is that even
                            where program appears to be spread quite “thin”, it is <pb n="540" xml:id="pg_540" facs="0560"/>causing <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> trouble. Moreover, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>,
                            specifically <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> and MinInterior, are aware of
                            risks and are now insisting that hamlets be established in most secure
                            areas first.</p>
                        <p>In sum, Task Force Saigon believes should welcome undeniable momentum
                            behind Strategic Hamlet Program, seek to impose priorities on it by
                            device of concentrating resources under US control on areas considered
                            most important, and accept as divided any benefits which flow from
                            operations of program in other areas.</p>
                        <p>We are in regular touch with <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> and believe above is in accord with his own
                            thinking. Will discuss further with him prior Honolulu meeting if
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>Re earth moving equipment, there are indications President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> is prepared to cut back on
                            Presidential Road Program and this may release some equipment for hamlet
                            construction. We are also studying other possibilities.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> In discussion with Pres <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> July 19, he raised question
                            priorities in Strategic Hamlet Program, saying he understood our desire
                            to gear our aid programs to the Strategic Hamlet Program, and need for
                            priorities. He said that general priorities are: (a) in white areas
                            extending into blue and eventually red; (b) in the richest and most
                            heavily populated parts of the Delta, roughly the ten provinces of the
                            Delta Plan; (c) in areas, especially coastal plains of central
                            provinces, where Viet Cong pressure greatest and danger of cutting the
                            country greatest. He said that the establishment of fixed priorities in
                            building strategic hamlets is not simple. In some areas, the districts,
                            villages and hamlets themselves are sufficiently rich and enthusiastic
                            to carry out program largely under their own steam. In poorer areas, or
                            in areas where the people are less ready to take sides, govt resources
                            would be concentrated. Thus there would continue to develop Strategic
                            Hamlets beyond the first priority areas indicated above, but govt help
                            would be applied on a priority basis as indicated in (a), (b), and (c)
                            above. In short the substance of this conversation, I believe,
                            reinforces the rationale of this telegram.</p>

                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_VVM1">Mau</persName> called on the
                            Secretary by appointment. The Secretary opened the conversation by
                            asking for the Foreign Minister's assessment of the progress being made
                            in Viet-Nam. The Foreign Minister replied that real military progress
                            was being made, especially as a result of the mobility provided to the
                            Viet-Nam forces by United States military assistance. He thought the
                            next need was for rapid telecommunications which would make this
                            mobility more effective.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that in his view there were two essential elements to
                            success in Viet-Nam. The first was to be sure of full popular support
                            for the Viet-Nam forces in their struggle against the guerrillas, and to
                            pursue that struggle to a successful conclusion. The United States did
                            not look upon Viet-Nam as a problem similar to Laos. In the first place
                            the Vietnamese people are fighting against infiltration and in the
                            second place the geography of Viet-Nam makes our assistance more
                            feasible. We therefore do not anticipate any negotiations looking toward
                            a Lao-type settlement in Viet-Nam. We have told the other side that if
                            they will stop the attacks peace will result in Viet-Nam. But we do not
                            intend to permit the other side any foothold in Viet-Nam, particularly
                            one which might be assisted by an airlift. Therefore the orders are to
                            shoot down any strange aircraft that appears over Viet-Nam. The second
                            element of success for Viet-Nam will depend upon good relations with its
                            neighbors. This would apply both to Laos and to Cambodia.</p>
                        <pb n="542" xml:id="pg_542" facs="0562"/>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said he agreed that good relations were essential
                            but dilated for some time upon the difficulties in establishing good
                            relations with Cambodia. He mentioned the Viet-Nam desire to have mixed
                            military commissions to secure the Cambodia-Viet-Nam border. He said
                            that Sihanouk had turned this down but had proposed the establishment of
                            a Viet-Nam military mission in Phnom Penh, a proposal which the
                            Vietnamese Government had accepted as a satisfactory first step.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that unsatisfactory relations with neighboring
                            countries in Southeast Asia seemed to arise partly from undue publicity
                            accorded to statements by personalities. There followed a certain
                            discussion about the problems of calming mutual press attacks, from
                            which the Foreign Minister drew the conclusion that external assistance
                            to this end would be of very little use.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said there was a point which he wished to raise
                            concerning the representation of the Viet Minh in Vientiane. He had
                            discussed this with Couve <note n="2" xml:id="d246fn2"> Maurice Couve de
                                Murville, French Foreign Minister.</note> and twice with <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna</persName>. Couve will discuss it again
                            with <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna</persName> in Paris on July 25.
                            He realized the Lao could not cut off all contact with the Viet Minh but
                            perhaps they would be willing to maintain the current status in which
                            South Viet-Nam has an Embassy and the Viet Minh merely a trade and
                            cultural mission. He asked U.S. support for this position. The Secretary
                            said that the problem does not concern Viet-Nam alone but also China,
                            Germany and probably Korea. He said that the U.S. will be alive to the
                            interests of Saigon in this matter.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that the next important problem concerned the
                            routes and points of control for withdrawal of Viet Minh forces from
                            Laos. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> pointed
                            out that this matter should best be discussed in Vientiane. The Foreign
                            Minister said he agreed but wished to stress his Government's interest
                            to the Secretary. The Secretary said that this was a matter of special
                            interest because of the difficulty in identifying Viet Minh troops and
                            suggested we should not rely entirely upon the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>. We should for example attempt to control infiltration
                            into Viet-Nam from the Vietnamese side of the border and we should also
                            exploit other means of assuring ourselves that the Viet Minh will
                            withdraw from Laos back into North Viet-Nam.</p>

                        <p>The Foreign Minister asked whether the Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> that the Russians will really
                            exercise control over the Chinese and the North Vietnamese to observe
                            the agreement on Laos. The Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> that the Russians did not want a war in Southeast
                            Asia and that they would therefore presumably exercise control over the
                            North Vietnamese to a point.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister asked whether the Chinese Communists had proposed a
                            conference on Viet-Nam. The Secretary replied that he had seen this only
                            in statements which the Chinese Communists had made but that no direct
                            proposals had been made to the U.S. The Foreign Minister pointed out
                            that <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna Phouma</persName> has made a
                            similar proposal.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> said that
                                <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna Phouma</persName> has a
                            tremendous problem in making neutrality a success in Laos. He felt that
                            the Vietnamese should not lay too heavy demands upon him. In the
                            Conference Saturday<note n="3" xml:id="d246fn3">A summary report of the

                            by their intervention and <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> thought the South Vietnamese had made a
                            tactical error by answering that intervention by a parallel statement of
                            accusations, some of which were directed against <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna Phouma</persName>. He said that <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna</persName> had been annoyed and told us
                            afterwards that he had been tempted to reply to Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_VVM1">Mau</persName>'s speech. <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> thought that it would be wise
                            for the Vietnamese to establish good relations with <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna</persName> because they must work with him
                            in the future. The Foreign Minister agreed that they must work with
                                <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna</persName> but that they should
                            not shield him from the problems he must face. No accusation had been
                            intended directly against <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna</persName>
                            in the Foreign Minister's speech. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna</persName> had interpreted it in that way and hoped that
                            the Vietnamese in the future would work with us helpfully to bolster
                                <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna Phouma</persName> rather than
                            making his work more difficult.</p>

                            <item>Mr. Maung Muang Gyi, Foreign Office</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>During the course of a reception given by the Burmese on Saturday, July
                            21, Mr. Barrington asked Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> whether the latter would appreciate an
                            opportunity to talk privately with the North Vietnamese. When the
                            Governor indicated his willingness to do so, Barrington arranged a
                            meeting for the following day in his room at the Hotel Suisse.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> opened the
                            conversation by recalling that the wartime policies of President
                            Roosevelt had envisaged independence for Vietnam through the mechanism
                            of some sort of international machinery. President Roosevelt had not
                            anticipated that the French would return to Indochina. He asked the
                            Foreign Minister what would have happened in his country if President
                            Roosevelt's policies had been carried out.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister replied that he and his government were well aware
                            of President Roosevelt's policies, and had been very surprised when the
                            Americans acquiesced in the attempt of the French to reestablish their
                            colonial control in Indochina. He felt that the following years were a
                            great tragedy and had caused much suffering to the people of
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>[Here follow eight paragraphs on the situation in Laos.]</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said he wished to turn from Laos to the question of
                            Vietnam. He said that the Vietnamese people strongly resented American
                            intervention in Vietnam. He said that the 1954 Agreements on Indochina
                            had provided for the reunification of Vietnam through elections. If it
                            had not been for the intervention of the US in 1956, that reunification
                            would have been achieved, either by federation or by elections, which
                            would have placed all of Vietnam under a single regime. US intervention
                            had in recent years grown worse until it was now a fact that American
                            forces were mercilessly killing Vietnamese citizens. While Governor
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> spoke of President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>'s policy which
                            respects neutrality, and the fact that it has produced an agreement on
                            Laos, the Foreign Minister could not understand how President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> could continue the policy of
                            military intervention in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> said that he
                            wished to reply very frankly to the statement which the Foreign Minister
                            had just made. President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>,
                            before making a decision to send increased military assistance to South
                            Vietnam in response to President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s request, had directed that a very careful study
                            be made of the situation. From that <pb n="545" xml:id="pg_545" facs="0565"/>study he was convinced, as the recent <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> report<note n="2" xml:id="d247fn2">See
                                    <ref target="#d208">Document 208</ref>.</note> has later borne
                            out, that the guerrilla activity and the killing in South Vietnam were
                            directed from the North, and that the guerrillas were led, trained and
                            supplied by the North. When President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> sent the additional forces into South Vietnam,
                            he made clear that they were there for the purposes of helping the
                            Vietnamese to defend themselves against this aggression from the North.
                            He also made clear that if that aggression stopped, there would be no
                            need for continued presence of those American forces. Therefore, the way
                            that peace could be brought to Vietnam would be for the North Vietnamese
                            to cease their aggression against South Vietnam, and to stop the
                            guerrilla activity. Then the status envisaged by the 1954 Agreements
                            could be reestablished and the possibilities of dealing with other
                            difficulties could be explored.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister replied that the Americans did not seem to
                            understand the situation in Vietnam. The history of South Vietnam has
                            always been one of struggle. The forces who are fighting against the
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> regime are people from
                            the South who take their weapons from those supplied by the Americans.
                            There are no North Vietnamese airplanes, ships or motor vehicles which
                            can bring guerrilla forces or weapons into Vietnam. This is a popular
                            revolt against the <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> regime
                            and American intervention is trying to suppress it. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>, noting an impending
                            appointment he had with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, said that he did not believe it would be useful to
                            argue the issue. He was thoroughly convinced, as were other objective
                            observers, that the cause of the trouble in South Vietnam came from the
                            North. The US military assistance to South Vietnam would continue so
                            long as that aggression persisted. He wanted the Foreign Minister to
                            understand that and to understand that the way to bring peace to Vietnam
                            was for the North to cease its aggression.</p>
                        <p>Before departing, however, he wished to return to the first part of the
                            conversation which he and the Foreign Minister had had concerning Laos.
                            He felt that clear undertakings on the part of the US Government and on
                            the part of the North Vietnamese to carry out scrupulously all the
                            provisions of the Geneva Agreements on Laos would result in peace in
                            Laos. He trusted that that would be done and that this sort of
                            cooperation between the US and North Vietnam could make a great
                            contribution toward the peace of Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister agreed with this statement and said he would
                            remember the first part of the conversation that he and Governor
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> had had this
                            afternoon. He hoped, however, that Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> would not forget the second part of the
                            conversation, and particularly what the Foreign Minister had had to say
                            about American military intervention in Vietnam.</p>

                        <p>On that note, the meeting broke up with mutual thanks to Mr. Barrington
                            for providing an opportunity for these talks to have taken place.</p>

                        <p>1. Gen <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> opened the
                            discussion by summarizing progress to date. He indicated there is no
                            doubt that we are on the winning side. If our programs continue, we can
                            expect <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> actions to decline. The
                            following subjects were summarized:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">a. Strategic Hamlet Program</p>
                        <p>With regard to the Strategic Hamlet program, 2400 have been constructed
                            and a total of 6000 should be completed by the end of the year. Some of
                            the hamlets are not particularly good. There has been no national plan
                            for their establishment. However, Pres <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> has recently formed a committee to coordinate the
                            program and <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> division commanders
                            will now be included in implementing actions. <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss> has initiated a program to
                            insure that equipment is phased into the Hamlet project in an orderly
                            manner.</p>
                        <p>It was pointed out that in certain areas the reception of the Hamlet
                            program has been very good. Approximately 115,000 Montagnard tribesmen
                            have come out of the hills, asking for help by the government. Pres
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> has visited some of the
                            tribes and has spoken to the people about the Hamlet program.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">b. Communications</p>
                        <p>Thus far, 14 provinces have been equipped. The Backbone system will be
                            completed by 1 September 1962. Reaction time has been improved
                            considerably.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">c. Training</p>
                        <p>Intelligence is improving and training programs are generally ahead of
                            schedule, including programs for the Army, the Civil Guard and the Self
                            Defense Corps. In this connection, it is planned that a retraining
                            program for the Self Defense Corps will be initiated next year.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">d. Operations</p>
                        <p>Contact is being made with the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> every
                            day. During April 434 ground operations were mounted. This was increased
                            to 441 in May. Over 1000 air sorties were flown in June. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> still needs to work on their
                            organization but progress is being made. Pres <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> has indicated that he plans that
                            his troops will get out in the field more often and stay out longer.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">e. River Boat Program</p>
                        <p>With regard to the boat program for inland waterways, Gen <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> stated that the program is
                            going well and that additional boats are not needed at present.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">f. Armed Helicopters</p>
                        <p>Gen <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> stated that some
                            helicopters should be armed for suppressive fire. Adm <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> outlined a request he had made
                            to the JCS for new USA flexible gun kits, the XM 153. He recommended the
                            kits and tech reps to assist in installation be sent to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. Sec <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> directed <persName corresp="#p_RVAHD1">VAdm

                            this item so that a report could be made next week. <gloss target="#t_SecDef1">SecDef</gloss> asked if helicopters were
                            equipped with self-sealing fuel tanks and/or armor. He was given a
                            negative reply. <gloss target="#t_SecDef1">SecDef</gloss> then indicated
                            he would speak with Army personnel further on the question during a
                            forthcoming visit to Fort Bragg.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">g. Defoliant Operations/Crop Destruction</p>
                        <p>Gen <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> next outlined
                            requests that have been made for further defoliation operations. The
                            single approved operation at Bien Hoa started the week of 15 July and is
                            in progress. A requirement exists for crop spraying in areas vacated by
                            the Montagnards when they move to the Strategic Hamlets. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> will use these crops unless they are
                            destroyed. Amb <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> pointed

                            made with movement of the Montagnards and that greater results could be
                            expected if crop destruction is undertaken. A critical point on the side
                            of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> is how to keep the infiltrators
                            fed. Adm <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> pointed out
                            that two recommendations were pending in JCS with respect to defoliant
                            operations (Delta area) and crop destruction. He stated he has not
                            forwarded a <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss>
                            recommendation on defoliating communication routes and an elephant grass
                            area in Northern <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. With regard to
                            crop destruction, <gloss target="#t_SecDef1">SecDef</gloss> inquired if
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> could procure required chemicals
                            on the world market, outside of the US. Mr <persName>Bundy</persName>
                            stated that they could probably purchase chemicals from Dow Chemical
                            Corp. <gloss target="#t_SecDef1">SecDef</gloss> asked Amb <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> if he felt that crop
                            destruction would create adverse propaganda in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. Amb <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>
                            replied that destruction of vacated Montagnard crops should not create a
                            problem and that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> have used
                            napalm to burn these crops. Food is a limiting factor in the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> campaign. The harvesting season is
                            approaching and we will need to act fast if we are going to get results.
                            Sec <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> next pointed out
                            the political problem involved. The US has just agreed to a settlement
                            in Laos. This is a critical time with regard to international relations.
                            It will be necessary to discuss this further in Washington.</p>

                        <p>1. Gen <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> summarized
                            progress of <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>.
                            The programs are coming along well and in most cases are ahead of
                            schedule. Equipment is being provided as fast as the troops are capable
                            of absorbing it. The limiting factor is the shortage of <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> officers and <gloss target="#t_NCO1">NCO</gloss>'s which should improve within the next 6 months. The
                                <gloss target="#t_VNN1">VNN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_VNMC1">VNMC</gloss> are in good shape and there is no shortage of
                            equipment.</p>
                        <p>2. <gloss target="#t_SecDef1">SecDef</gloss> noted that 6 months ago we
                            had practically nothing and we have made tremendous progress to date.
                            However, we have been concentrating on short term crash-type actions and
                            now we must look ahead to a carefully conceived long-range program for
                            training and equipping <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> and phase
                            out of major US combat, advisory and logistics support activities. He
                            asked how long a period before the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            could be eliminated as a disturbing force. Gen <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> estimated about one year
                            from the time that we are able to get <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> fully operational and really pressing
                            the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> in all areas.</p>
                        <pb n="549" xml:id="pg_549" facs="0569"/>
                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_SecDef1">SecDef</gloss> directed that a long-range
                            program be laid out to include training requirements, equipment
                            requirements, US advisory requirements, and US units assuming that it is
                            going to require approximately 3 years to bring the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>
                            under control. <gloss target="#t_SecDef1">SecDef</gloss> pointed out
                            that we will have a big replacement job next year for US personnel;
                            about 8,000 will have to be replaced. We must get moving now on language
                            training, guerrilla training and other related items in order to keep
                            the pipeline full. Adm <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName>
                            noted that in the materiel field, availability of helicopters for VNAF
                            would be a problem. <gloss target="#t_SecDef1">SecDef</gloss> stated
                            that production of helicopters could be speeded up and directed that
                            optimum requirements be submitted in order that FY 64 procurement can be
                            expedited.</p>
                        <p>4. The subject of availability of VNAF pilots was discussed and <persName corresp="#p_ABGRH1">BGen Anthis</persName> pointed out the major
                            problem of obtaining <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> clearances for
                            personnel to be sent to <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss> for
                            pilot training.</p>
                        <p>5. <gloss target="#t_SecDef1">SecDef</gloss> then stated that we are
                            behind schedule in our Defended Hamlet-Strategic Village program and the
                            key to the problem is wresting areas from <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> control and protecting the population. We must take a
                            conservative view and assume it will take 3 years instead of one year.
                            We must line up our long range program as it may become difficult to
                            retain public support for our operations in Vietnam. The political
                            pressure will build up as US losses continue to occur. In other words we
                            must assume the worst and make our plans accordingly.</p>
                        <p>6. Gen <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> pointed out
                            that some areas are better than others and described successes in the
                            Delta area where the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has increased
                            its control in one area from 40% to 70% in the past year. He also
                            pointed out that all actions are not <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            actions but some are conducted by “bandits” which have been operating in
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> for thousands of years.</p>
                        <p>7. <gloss target="#t_SecDef1">SecDef</gloss> announced that training of
                            Citizens' Irregular Defense Groups (<gloss target="#t_CIDG1">CIDG</gloss>) would be assumed by DOD. The details for this
                            takeover will be worked out by … <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> and
                            requirements reported to DOD.</p>
                        <p>8. Mr <persName>Johnson</persName> asked about the morale of the <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>.
                            Gen <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> stated that this
                            was a problem in view of the large numbers of casualties, infiltration
                            of <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> by the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, separation
                            from families, no rotational policy for relieving troops in the field,
                            and other matters. Amb <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>
                            stated that a request had been made to State Dept to provide PL 480
                            foodstuffs to help in this area.</p>
                        <p>9. Adm <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> passed out <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> Weekly Intelligence Digest of

                        <p>a. Prepare a long-range training program with view to establishing

                        <p>1. Gen <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> gave a brief
                            description of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> strategic hamlet
                            program. There is no overall government program for building strategic
                            hamlets: Country Team is working with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> committee, appointed last week, to develop this
                            program. <gloss target="#t_CT1">CT</gloss> plan is to introduce
                            materials as soon as possible for 1500 additional hamlets. Amb <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> stated Country Team was
                            pushing on all fronts with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to get
                            orderly priorities. Situation still not clear. Basic problem is that
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is building sporadically all
                            over the country where it is safe to do so. <gloss target="#t_CT1">CT</gloss> agrees following priorities are paramount; First—Delta

                        <p>2. Gen <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> cited definite
                            progress evidenced by Presidential Decree issued two weeks ago placing
                            division commanders in charge of implementation of the strategic hamlet

                        <p>3. Amb <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> indicated that the

                            strategic hamlets by placing US assistance in areas we deem
                            important</p>

                        <p>4. Sec <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> asked what types
                            and quantities of materials were needed for strategic hamlet
                            construction, and what items came under <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>.</p>
                        <p> Col Buchanan, <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss>, indicated
                            that 397 villages had been programmed in FY 62 and FY 63 <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> for completion by the end of FY 63.

                            additional villages. He cited the following planning figures:</p>
                        <p>a. Each village averages four hamlets. There are roughly 2,500 villages

                            hamlet program and asked that the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> hamlet programs be
                            organized, balanced, and a report returned to Washington.</p>
                        <p>6. Adm <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> brought up the
                            fact that many critics hold the hamlet program as being of no value and
                            equate it to the old French program. He stated that the two were not the
                            same and we need to do something to emphasize the effectiveness of the
                            hamlet program. The SecDef called for a series of articles to educate
                            the populace. Adm <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> stated
                            we have been putting emphasis on the <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> in defending the

                            pursuit of Viet Cong. Sec <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> mentioned a pessimistic report of the
                            Washington teams on the hamlet program and indicated perhaps Washington

                            is a fear on part of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> that the United
                            States may change its policy toward <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.
                            We have to nip this in the bud and convince the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> that they don't have to fear a Laos-type
                            neutrality.</p>
                        <p>2. Amb <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> mentioned the

                            VN-generated funds. <gloss target="#t_SecDef1">SecDef</gloss> said that
                            the piaster problem should be discussed in plenary session later in the

                            problem by saying that we are not going to solve it by reducing our job
                            in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> has No. 1 priority in foreign exchange when supported

                        <p>4. Amb <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> said that he looks
                            upon the Strategic Hamlet Program as a principal arm of the general
                            pacification program. He pointed out that, in addition to strengthening
                            the village physical <pb n="553" xml:id="pg_553" facs="0573"/>defenses,
                            it was necessary to develop the will of the village people to resist. Mr
                            Phillips added that hamlets which demonstrate the will to resist are
                            targets of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_SecDef1">SecDef</gloss> asked what arms the villagers
                            possessed. Mr Phillips said shotguns, grenades, and some French rifles.
                                <gloss target="#t_SecDef1">SecDef</gloss> then said not to let
                            shortage of arms keep us from arming the villagers properly. Requisition
                            carbines if they can do the job better. We should indicate the number of
                            people in the villages that should be armed with the carbine.</p>
                        <p>5. Amb <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> said <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is hurting for trained manpower, not
                            only in military but in all branches of government. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is doing better and quality of Province
                            Chiefs is improving. Developments in education were highlighted and Mr
                            Phillips, in answering question by <gloss target="#t_SecDef1">SecDef</gloss>, said that the school capacity has increased.</p>
                        <p>6. Amb <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> pointed out that
                            organizational arrangements on American side their linking with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> side was greatly improved. Amb
                                <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> said members of
                            hamlet councils must have a living wage. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> wants to pay 300 piasters per month. This is not
                            enough. <gloss target="#t_SecDef1">SecDef</gloss> said he wished the
                            Sub-Committee on piasters to think about PL 480; that there is no limit
                            on the amount of goods that the United States will supply. Amb <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> is encouraged by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> planning not to stop improvements in
                            the education of leaders at hamlet and village level but to go on up to
                            higher levels of government. <gloss target="#t_SecDef1">SecDef</gloss>
                            pointed out that we should get to the US press the fact that village
                            officials will be elected.</p>
                        <p>7. Amb <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> said that economic
                            progress also depends on the success of the pacification program. He
                            said that there is better economic planning. Now there is a more
                            realistic point of view displayed by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            on deficit financing—hopes that we can make good on this. Agreed with
                            Gen <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> that we have
                            signs for encouragement.</p>
                        <p>8. Mr <persName corresp="#p_FWH1">Fippin</persName> said that some

                            against all odds. In regard to local administrators, the National
                            Institute of Administration has trained 500 people. Each province has a

                            63-68 Sec <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated he
                            needed a more detailed break-down of the force maintenance figure of
                            47.1 million for <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> plus 20 or 30

                                <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> added that

                            maintenance total.</p>

                            that additional 18 HUS-1's in the 63 program would provide for a second
                            squadron of helicopters. Sec <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> asked when the VNAF pilots would be trained and

                            Gen <persName corresp="#p_TMGC1">Timmes</persName> stated there is no

                            warehouses and there are adequate stocks. Amb <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> stated that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has imposed rigorous controls on the
                            issue of medical supplies to prevent their falling into the hands of the

                            administrators.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary of Discussion</p>
                        <p>1. This item was mentioned briefly under item #8 but deferred until item
                            #10 discussion.</p>
                        <p>2. Amb <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> stated that a
                            sub-committee earlier in the day had studied the problem as to what to
                            do about the piaster shortage. Amb <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> pointed out that it was necessary to keep
                            momentum on <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> side of the picture.
                            Application of economic and social measures at village level is
                            essential to success in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. In order to
                            accomplish this, radical changes should be made in the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> Program as follows:</p>
                        <p>a. Shift emphasis from long-range <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
                            projects to short-range village and Montagnard aid.</p>
                        <p>b. <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> can be made effective only by
                            breaking away from some of the existing restrictive procedures, thereby
                            achieving flexibility in funding.</p>
                        <p>c. Project aid should be increased from $27 million for FY 62 to $83
                            million for FY 63.</p>
                        <p>d. Scale down commercial aid allocated for FY 62 to generate piasters.
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has agreed to deficit financing
                            of 3-1/2 billion piasters. Import program of $120 million commercial aid
                            will prevent inflation and get <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>
                            through this calendar year. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will
                            have to use deficit financing of at least $120 million to get through
                            next year (their FY 63). To back up military expenses and efforts, some
                            new paths in <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> program must be cut;
                            i.e., stand behind <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> on the import
                            program.</p>
                        <p>e. With regard to problem of off-shore procurement and gold outflow, Amb
                            would request waiver of US supply requirement on a case-by-case
                            basis.</p>

                        <p>3. Sec <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> agreed with Amb
                                <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> and mentioned that
                            he should continue to request waivers. We should further be willing to
                            accept the price penalty.</p>
                        <p>4. Sec <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated he was
                            willing and anxious to take over financing of certain <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> programs that have military
                            application. However, to do this the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> programs for FY 63
                            must be reviewed. Sec <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            directed Mr <persName>Bundy</persName> to look into this.</p>
                        <p>5. Amb <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> stated the
                            foregoing discussion should cure the piaster problem but that if abuses
                            against people by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, i.e., attempts to
                            save on expenditures with “free labor”, continue we may have to impose

                        <p>1. You will recall in November and December 1961 that <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> was reluctant to accept U.S.
                            advice or specific political actions incident to increased U.S. military
                            and economic assistance. At the time, the U.S. decided to accept
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s reservations and move
                            forward with the positive military aspects of your mission, with the
                            hope that <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> could be
                            encouraged later to carry out parallel political reforms. Subsequently
                            the military position has improved, but progress on the political side
                            has been slow. The final report of the Vietnamese Task Force<note n="2" xml:id="d249fn2">
                                <ref target="#d233">Document 233</ref>.</note>
                            <pb n="557" xml:id="pg_557" facs="0577"/>concluded that <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s popularity has, in fact,
                            decreased in the past year. During this period there has been continuing
                            public criticism of <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s
                            regime. If the possible Communist proposal for an international
                            conference on South Viet-Nam materializes, South Vietnam will be without
                            a favorable political base from which to bargain. At the same time, our
                            strengthened military capabilities may be facing their severest test by
                            increased Communist infiltration of personnel and improved equipment via
                            Laos which occurred just prior to signing of the Accords.</p>
                        <p>2. You have broached the subject of political progress within the Special
                            Group (<gloss target="#t_CI1">CI</gloss>) on several occasions during
                            the past six months. Both within that forum and the Viet-Nam Task Force,
                            State has emphasized the need for patience in encouraging <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> to make necessary reforms. The
                            acceptable procedures are stated to be selected approaches to <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> by the Ambassador, a hoped-for
                            evolution of <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s own
                            comprehension of the needs, and limited placement of U.S. advisors in
                            the countryside to effect improvement at the lower end of the
                            administrative chain without recourse to the Saigon hierarchy. Though
                            State adhered to this strategy, there has been conviction on the Defense
                            side that action is urgently required to make the political gains
                            essential to further improvement of the military situation.</p>
                        <p>3. In the past month or so Mr. Rostow has apparently decided to grab this
                            ball. He told Bob Johnson to study the political relationships in South
                            Viet-Nam and determine steps that might be taken to improve the
                            political environment. He also asked for suggestions as to how to
                            implement such actions. <persName>Johnson</persName> completed his
                                paper<note n="3" xml:id="d249fn3">Reference is to a 55-page draft
                                paper entitled “South Viet-Nam: The Political Relationship Between
                                the Central Government and the Countryside”, July 17. Divided into
                                seven sections, it traced the relationship from the colonial period
                                to post-war Vietnam and analyzed the sources of disaffection in the
                                countryside. (Department of State, <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss> Files: Lot 69 D 121, Vietnam 1962) The final text

                            last week, and it is to be discussed at the NSC Standing Group luncheon
                            today. Copies were taken by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName> to Honolulu to be passed to Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> for his comment.</p>
                        <p>4. The basis from which the paper was formulated does not depart from the
                            policy established some months ago. The following extract from the
                            introduction will illustrate this:</p>
                        <p>” … We have approached this problem, at least in recent months, with
                            certain basic assumptions:<note n="4" xml:id="d249fn4">Ellipsis in the

                        </p>
                        <p>“a. That re-establishment of security in the countryside was the sine qua
                            non; that it is difficult or impossible to establish a relationship of
                            cooperation and mutual confidence when the countryside is under heavy
                            coercive pressure.</p>

                        <p>“b. That we should not seek to impose our concepts of government on a
                            society which is not ready for them and which is, in any event, not
                            presently in a position where it can realistically adopt many of
                            them.</p>
                        <p>“c. That we must work with the <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> Government.</p>
                        <p>“The analysis in this paper accepts these assumptions. The argument that
                            security must come first, however, also recognizes that improved
                            intelligence on <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> activities is a
                            precondition to successful military action and that improved
                            intelligence depends upon improved cooperation of the rural population.
                            If the present vicious circle is to be broken non-military measures to
                            improve identification of the government with the population are
                            important to military success. Democracy per se is clearly not the
                            answer in Viet Nam, but our analysis will suggest that improved channels
                            of upward communication are important and that one way to improve
                            channels may be to provide new means of participation. We must work with
                            the <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> government, but we must
                            also be prepared to make a sustained effort to press for essential
                            non-military reforms. Sustained failure could raise questions about the
                            assumption.”</p>
                        <p>5. A revealing conclusion of this study is the major lack of information
                            available on the nature of political actions taken by the <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> government. This includes many
                            programs viewed by the Country Team as positive accomplishments, i.e.,
                            land reform, training of civic action cadres for the strategic hamlets
                            and province pacification, and administration of the strategic hamlet
                            program. Some of the recommendations made in the study are conditioned
                            on the subsequent provision of such information. Bob Johnson
                            specifically deplores the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> failure to
                            implement the province surveys which emanated from your report.<note n="5" xml:id="d249fn5">See <ref target="frus1961-63v01#d210">

                        <p>6. In general the paper implies that difficulties in government
                            relationships with the populace are due in part to lack of action, but
                            beyond that is due to poor implementation. There is a flow of
                            administrative authority downward, but no provision for a flow upward
                            from which subsequent decisions can be predicated on actions,
                            recommendations, and situations existing at the village level. Rural
                            officials are accorded responsibilities without parallel authority.</p>
                        <p>7. The recommendations which stem from this study are summarized on
                            dipped pages 3 through 8 which you may wish to scan. In brief form,
                            these recommendations call for:</p>
                        <p>a. Closer collaboration between the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>b. Proper training of province and district chiefs aimed, by positive
                            demonstration, to achieve a change in attitude.</p>
                        <pb n="559" xml:id="pg_559" facs="0579"/>
                        <p>c. Training of village and hamlet chiefs similar to that for the higher
                            officials in b above, with the participation of <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> advisors.</p>
                        <p>d. Refinement of the training of civic action cadres for strategic
                            hamlets.</p>
                        <p>e. The inclusion of a simple training program covering the elements of
                            procedural protection in judicial proceedings against individuals.</p>
                        <p>f. Supplement appointed village and hamlet councils by elected advisory
                            councils and establish procedures whereby an entire village and/or
                            hamlet population can contribute regularly to local administration.</p>
                        <p>g. Reduce the number of mass organizations at the hamlet level to the one
                            or two organizations which can be useful.</p>
                        <p>h. Obtain <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> approval for the placement
                            of an <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> advisor in each of the
                            provinces.</p>
                        <p>i. Seek <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> action to complete
                            implementation of the land reform program.</p>
                        <p>j. Press the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> for a decision on the
                            Montagnard program proposed by the Country Team.</p>
                        <p>k. Seek a means of reducing the price of fertilizer to the farmer through
                            subsidy or otherwise.</p>
                        <p>l. Develop a feasible public works program to improve the lot of the poor
                            farmer by keeping him employed at work during off seasons.</p>
                        <p>m. Establish fair salaries for village and hamlet chiefs.</p>
                        <p>n. Press the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> for action on U.S.
                            proposals for military civic action.</p>
                        <p>o. Study the possibilities of having the sects throw their political
                            weight behind the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>p. Establish a defector interrogation program under U.S. leadership
                            designed to get at the reasons why individuals join the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>q. Improve our information on the sources of dissidence, status of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> programs, quality of local officials,
                            and other essential information, using U.S. personnel now in the
                            countryside.</p>
                        <p>8. On implementation, the paper suggests that these recommendations be
                            reviewed carefully and, as a starter, two or three items be selected as
                            a subject of a serious high level démarche to <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>, using as a pretext prospective
                            economic discussions. The requirement for a Presidential communication
                            is recognized.</p>
                        <p>9. This paper is important because it recognizes our actions on the
                            non-military side are moving behind, and hazarding, the military effort.
                            If this premise gains acceptance, it raises basic issues:</p>
                        <p>a. Can improvements be achieved through <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> or is a change necessary?</p>
                        <p>b. Can the military handle prospective increased <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> actions within the environment of the current rate of
                            political progress or are accelerated political reforms required?</p>
                        <p>c. Is the current political atmosphere in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> conducive to a direct confrontation with <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> on this issue?</p>
                        <p>d. If the risks outweigh the prospective gains of pressing <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> for reforms, what alternatives
                            will gain time for the current evolution of political reform to take
                            effect in the countryside?</p>
                        <pb n="560" xml:id="pg_560" facs="0580"/>
                        <p>There will be an early need to assess these questions here and in Saigon.

                        <p>Attached is a study of Embassy Saigon's and <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>'s proposals for destroying crops in South Viet Nam,
                            which we have prepared at Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REE1">Rice</persName>'s request.<note n="2" xml:id="d250fn2">Not
                                printed.</note> A brief description of the reasoning and conclusions
                            contained in the basic study follows:</p>
                        <p>Destroying crops will inevitably have political repercussions.
                            Intelligence is not yet reliable enough to assure that the crops
                            destroyed are those controlled solely by the Viet Cong. Some innocent,
                            or at least persuadable, peasants will be hurt and the Viet Cong will
                            make the most of this in their propaganda and recruiting.
                            Internationally, there will undoubtedly be greater reaction to a program
                            of crop destruction than there was to defoliation.</p>
                        <p>These are serious liabilities, but under certain conditions the benefits
                            from an effective program for destroying crops might be even
                            weightier.</p>
                        <p>Food in South Viet Nam is plentiful, and it is not likely that a program
                            for destroying crops would be effective enough to produce starvation
                            among the Viet Cong, but two realistic strategic goals do seem possible.
                            First, an effective program might be able to cut down food supplies
                            enough to prevent the Viet Cong from stockpiling, thus making it
                            difficult for them to concentrate large forces and sustain them in
                            combat. Second, an effective program would force the Viet Cong to spend
                            an increasing proportion of their time on acquiring and transporting
                            food, rather than fighting.</p>
                        <p>If these results could be achieved, then the political price might be
                            acceptable. It seems clear, however, that such results could be achieved
                            only at a later stage in the counter-guerrilla campaign, after the Viet
                            Cong have been isolated from the peasants and driven into well-defined
                            areas of concentration. To be effective, the program would have to be
                            extensive, and it is doubtful whether the government <pb n="562" xml:id="pg_562" facs="0582"/>could carry out an extensive program
                            while the Viet Cong are as widely dispersed as they are at present. An
                            ineffective or premature program would only force the Viet Cong to
                            intensify their efforts to penetrate or destroy nearby strategic
                            hamlets, and the strategic hamlet program is in its present nascent
                            state still extremely vulnerable.</p>

                        <p>1. By references a and b, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> have recommended and <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> has concurred in a proposal for the Vietnamese to
                            conduct a trial program of chemical crop destruction in eight target
                            areas totaling 2,500 acres in South Vietnam. This program would be
                            conducted in conjunction with the Hai Yen II operation to pacify Phu Yen
                            Province. There is considerable Viet Cong (<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>) strength in this area.</p>
                        <p>2. The proposed operation would be carried out entirely by Vietnamese
                            personnel using their own helicopters. US personnel would not
                            participate directly and their aid would be limited to technical advice
                            and assistance. Target determination has been based on best intelligence
                            available and would be reconfirmed by joint US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> assessment prior to the attack.</p>
                        <pb n="563" xml:id="pg_563" facs="0583"/>
                        <p>3. Air and ground cover by the Vietnamese armed forces will be required
                            for the operation. In the target areas which are controlled and occupied
                            by the Viet Cong the cover operations may result in the bonus effect of
                            improved possibilities of engagement of Viet Cong by Government of
                            Vietnam forces.</p>
                        <p>4. On the basis of extensive briefing (including one on 25 June 1962 with
                            President Diem)<note n="4" xml:id="d251fn4">The report on this meeting
                                is not printed.</note> and their evaluation of the technical factors
                            and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> preparations, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> and General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> are convinced
                            that crop destruction can result in a substantial military advantage and
                            that the material and herbicides to be employed are technically
                            effective. They are further convinced that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> methods of determining targets, based on best available
                            ground and air intelligence, take into account all necessary factors.
                            The Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, staff is in a position to
                            render adequate technical advice.</p>
                        <p>5. In order to determine the capability of the armed forces of the
                            Republic of Vietnam to launch and sustain on its own a crop destruction
                            program on an operational basis, a trial operation such as proposed
                            herein should be conducted to determine the feasibility of further
                            operations.</p>
                        <p>6. The Montagnards, who have been threatened, attacked, raped, and
                            murdered by the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, are leaving their
                            tribal areas because of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> levies upon
                            them for food, forced labor, and other support. They are fleeing to the
                            security of the Government of Vietnam controlled areas. Their crops,
                            abandoned to the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> or taken over by
                            them, must be destroyed in order to deprive the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> of this capability of living off the land.</p>
                        <p>7. An interesting side effect in such an operation as crop destruction is
                            that because of the superstitious nature of the rural peasant in
                            Vietnam, the ability of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to kill
                            large areas of vegetation “magically” makes a deep impression on him.
                            During the Delta Mangrove defoliation operation one hundred and twelve
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> surrendered when it was publicly
                            announced that additional defoliation operations would be conducted.</p>
                        <p>8. An additional factor favoring this proposal is that it would be the
                            first trial of the strategic hamlet concept with complemental food
                            denial operations. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>
                            has consistently supported the use of herbicides, particularly for crop
                            destruction.</p>

                        <p>9. The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that you approve the proposal
                            contained in reference a. Authority for its implementation is

                        </list>
                        <p>1. One matter which was discussed at Honolulu <note n="2" xml:id="d252fn2">
                                <ref target="#d248">Document 248</ref>.</note> was the care of the
                            Montagnards, some of whom are hungry, most of whom need assistance in
                            some form. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, for many reasons,
                            has done less than they might have to care for these people, despite the
                            great importance of their good will and their potential usefulness as
                            combatants.</p>
                        <p>2. It is my belief that Montagnard fighters, along with the village
                            defenders, the Civil Guard and the Self Defense Corps are going to be
                            the decisive factor in the war. While the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> will ultimately be the mobile mechanism that attacks
                            the hard <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> concentrations, the battle
                            will largely be won in the hamlets and the countryside by the less
                            sophisticated elements.</p>
                        <p>3. It is plain, in supporting these irregular and paramilitary elements,
                            that there should be no restraints anywhere. Unfortunately, there are.
                            The United States can give them hardware and training, but it is not
                            easy for us to give them pay, pensions, family gratuities or other
                            support which embodies gold. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, on
                            the other hand, is reluctant to spend its cash on these same support
                            projects.</p>
                        <p>4. Perhaps there is a way out. I suggest this sort of reasoning:</p>
                        <pb n="565" xml:id="pg_565" facs="0585"/>
                        <p>a. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would like very much to have
                            some of the more sophisticated hardware items, which they do not really
                            need—more tanks, aircraft, etc.</p>
                        <p>b. We are quite able to produce and deliver these items.</p>
                        <p>c. We should therefore tell the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            that</p>
                        <p>(1) We do not think they need the articles; but</p>
                        <p>(2) We will build and sell them to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> at 10-20% of their cost; understanding that</p>
                        <p>(3) They will make payment to us in piasters.</p>
                        <p>d. These piasters should then be applied, at our discretion, to meeting
                            the currency needs of the irregular and paramilitary elements mentioned
                            in paragraph 3 above. We could even make the disbursements through Diem,
                            if to do so would enhance his prestige.</p>

                        <p>Since our talk this morning on the objectives of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>' proposed trip, I have been over
                            his memorandum<note n="2" xml:id="d253fn2">
                                <ref target="#d241">Document 241</ref>.</note> again and find it
                            even more impractical than I mentioned this morning. His whole thesis is
                            based on the assumption that a Laos-type of international agreement is
                            possible and enforceable for the whole of Southeast Asia. The proposed
                            Presidential statement, “Peace Charter for Southeast Asia,” could only
                            be implemented by an international agreement similar to the one that we
                            have reached on Laos. This would require us to take commitments without
                            any assurance of the other side doing the same, with no enforcement
                            procedures that would be workable. To negotiate such an agreement would
                            require another Geneva meeting, which I understood everyone was opposed
                            to because of its effect on the situation in South Vietnam. Most of the
                            suggested economic objectives can be achieved only after there is peace,
                            and do not give a sufficient basis for immediate heads of government
                            discussions.</p>

                        <p>I will be glad to go over the memorandum in detail with you (which
                            shouldn't take long), and <persName corresp="#p_REE1">Ed Rice</persName>
                            and I believe you will come to the same conclusions we have.<note n="3" xml:id="d253fn3">At the bottom of the source text the following was
                                typed in capital letters: “I find Walt Rostow agrees that plan is
                                impractical under present circumstances and would cause difficulties
                                if raised with governments now.” On August 1, <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> sent a memorandum to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_REE1">Rice</persName> stating that he
                                could see no value in the trip unless a brand new approach was
                                developed. He instructed <persName corresp="#p_REE1">Rice</persName>
                                to make no commitments without clearing them with him and suggested
                                that <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>' staff be
                                informed that a special trip at that time would be

                        <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> have recommended initiation of an operational
                            herbicide program in nine selected portions of the Delta area of South
                            Vietnam, comprising approximately 60 miles of overland routes (map, Tab
                                A).<note n="2" xml:id="d254fn2">The recommendation was made in a
                                memorandum from Harold Brown, Director of Defense Research and
                                Engineering, to <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>,
                                July 28. (Washington National Records Center, RG 330, OSD Files: FRC
                                66 A 3542, Vietnam 1962, 370.64) The map is not printed.</note>
                            Their recommendation is predicated on the belief that the application of
                            herbicides will increase visibility to Vietnamese forces and aid in the
                            detection of Viet Cong units; perhaps improve fields of fire in limited
                            fashion; and deny concealed forward assembly areas, attack positions,
                            and ambush sites to the Viet Cong. The spraying will be done by American
                            crews in C-123 aircraft with South Vietnamese observers on board.</p>
                        <p>Upon review of this recommendation, and after consultation with research
                            specialists, I recommend that you approve the operational employment of
                            herbicides in South Vietnam. The Department of State concurs and is
                            forwarding its favorable recommendation to you under separate
                                cover.<note n="3" xml:id="d254fn3">A copy of this memorandum, July

                        <p>The equipment modifications recommended in the course of our intensive
                            review of the herbicide program last spring have been accomplished and
                            successfully tested in the United States. Chemical specialists are in
                            Vietnam to provide General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> with the requisite professional advice. The best
                            results in the original herbicide test program were achieved against
                            mangrove targets and the present program is aimed primarily at mangrove
                            areas. A measure of the improved visibility attainable in mangrove is
                            illustrated in the attached photographs (Tab B).<note n="4" xml:id="d254fn4">Not found.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Politically, it would appear that the earlier herbicide tests in South
                            Vietnam induced the maximum amount of adverse Sino-Soviet propaganda,
                            although we received none of the benefits of a successful herbicide
                            operation. I am inclined to believe that the propaganda impact has now
                            been made and that we can use herbicides without causing a serious new
                            international incident.</p>
                        <p>The herbicide program recommended herein is distinct from a separate
                            proposal to initiate crop destruction activities in Vietnam, now under
                            discussion. If you approve the resumption of herbicide operations
                            against mangrove targets in the Delta area, the program will be
                            activated immediately.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Here are some thoughts about prisoners in Vietnam and a recommendation
                            for your consideration.</p>
                        <pb n="568" xml:id="pg_568" facs="0588"/>
                        <p>The Vietnamese program for prisoners is still mostly an “oriental
                            mystery.” U.S. military and civil authorities in Vietnam have some
                            knowledge of and influence on parts of the Vietnamese program, and some
                            improvements have been made. However, the entire program is still quite
                            short of the real potential a well-done prisoner program has for giving
                            substantial support towards winning the war against the Communists.</p>
                        <p>In Vietnam, the war embraces the entire population. In Vietnam, also, the
                            political prisoners range from captured Vietcong military on down to
                            non-Communist politicos opposed to the regime, including some whose
                            opposition is mainly forensic. In a total war, such as Vietnam, what
                            happens to all of these political prisoners has a direct bearing on
                            whether or not the people support the government's war effort. In
                            effect, the people are the judge and the government's actions must
                            reflect the true desires of the people, to be successful. If the actions
                            don't reflect this, being either too timid or too harsh, the people will
                            either lose respect for the government or sullenly resent it; in either
                            case, they will be vulnerable to Communist exploitation.</p>
                        <p>A well-done prisoner program should follow a uniform code, in practice
                            and not just lip-service. It should include providing ways and means for
                            establishing true justice in the country, for collecting intelligence,
                            for attracting the surrender of the Vietcong, for separating hard-core
                            Communists from other prisoners, and for true rehabilitation of
                            prisoners as deserved and earned.</p>
                        <p>The Vietnamese leaders have been sensitive about their prisoner program,
                            probably due to spotty administration as much as anything. It is
                            embarrassing to have an American note sloppy work by an administrator
                            and then criticize it; this is particularly true if the American is
                            inclined to righteousness over maladministration of justice. The problem
                            of Vietnamese prisoners is further compounded by the jurisdictional
                            overlapping between <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> Defense and
                            Interior, the split of U.S. responsibilities between U.S. civil and
                            military authorities, and the emotions aroused by the savagery of
                            guerrilla warfare. Also, Vietnamese methods of prisoner rehabilitation,
                            based on French “disintoxication” procedures, deserve a hard
                            evaluation</p>
                        <p>U.S. experience with the handling of prisoners similar to the problem in
                            Vietnam is limited. Most of the prisoner problems in Korea were quite
                            different. In Greece, there was some pioneering experience with the
                            rehabilitation of Communists in the Greek Army (which gave me some
                            starting ideas for the later development of <gloss target="#t_EDCOR1">EDCOR</gloss> in the Philippines). In Vietnam, my own early work
                            was mostly on assisting the Vietnamese compile a single code of justice
                            from three regional codes then in existence and in establishing uniform
                            penal procedures; I relied heavily on “metis” in the French Army at
                            first, and later passed <pb n="569" xml:id="pg_569" facs="0589"/>the
                            legal and police program aspects to Michigan State contract personnel
                            with <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> in Vietnam; my last work on
                            this was when President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>
                            asked my advice on quelling a prison riot, some time ago.</p>
                        <p>The Philippine experience in handling Huk prisoners offers a helpful
                            starting point, although there are some basic differences in the
                            Vietnamese problem which must be considered. The psychological aspects
                            of the Philippine experience, which led to the surrender of large
                            numbers of Communist guerrillas and which led to favorable rumors
                            throughout Asia, and the sound social justice administered (even when
                            the writ of habeas corpus was suspended temporarily), suggest that there
                            are lessons to be learned and applied.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation</p>
                        <p>It is recommended:</p>
                        <p>a. That you continue giving a personal touch to U.S. actions in Vietnam
                            by sponsoring a team to visit Vietnam, where it will assist the Country
                            Team in constructing a full, realistic Vietnamese prisoner program, in
                            the spirit of the President's memo of 18 July about helping Country
                            Teams in critical areas.<note n="2" xml:id="d255fn2">Not found.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>b. That the team be interdepartmental, within the framework of existing
                            Task Force, but known to have your personal backing; both the
                            substantial help to military operations and the need to scotch ugly
                            stories of torture m the presence of U.S. military dictate Defense's
                            paramount interest in the program.</p>
                        <p>c. That <gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss> assist you with Task Force
                            staffing and that my office assist you in the selection and readying of
                            the team; my staff and <gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss> know how to
                            work well in tandem for you.</p>
                        <p>d. That the team be small, picked for its “feel” for
                            political/psychological and intelligence needs as well as technical
                            penal know-how, and composed of workers willing to work hard in
                            cooperative staffing in Vietnam for the Country Team; my choice would be
                            a personal representative for you and a technician from <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>, with your representative being either
                            Lt-Col <persName corresp="#p_WDM1">Wilson</persName> of my staff or Col
                            Kent of <gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss>; the team must be able to
                            get willing cooperation from the Vietnamese—not just write another staff
                            paper.</p>
                        <p>e. That the team visit the Philippines, en route to Vietnam, to obtain
                            details of the prisoner program (including <gloss target="#t_EDCOR1">EDCOR</gloss>) during the Huk campaign.</p>

                            deal adequately with the costs implicit in the wider use which probably
                            would follow. If we make chemicals available for crop destruction we
                            would not be able long to deny it to the world. This would hurt us
                            everywhere:</p>
                        <p>The way to win a guerrilla war, basically, is to win the people. Crop
                            destruction runs counter to this basic rule. The problem of identifying
                            fields on which the Viet Cong depend is hardly susceptible to solution
                            so long as the Viet Cong and the people are co-mingled. The Government
                            will gain the enmity of people whose crops are destroyed and whose wives
                            and children will either have to stay in place and suffer hunger or
                            become homeless refugees living on the uncertain bounty of a
                            not-too-efficient government.</p>
                        <p>Other people, who merely sympathize with them, will also hate the
                            government for crop destruction. The use of strange chemical agents, to
                            destroy crops, strikes at something basic implanted in human beings
                            (even if the people do not—as many will—fear that the chemical agents
                            are also directly harmful to people).</p>
                        <p>Those relatively few of us who study the means of warfare run a risk of
                            forgetting how the mass of people are likely to feel about those means.

                            to be in favor of crop destruction just as it is natural—at the other
                            end of the spectrum—for <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> generals to
                            be for atomic bombs. The people who may prospectively or actually be at

                            their estrangement is to lose sight of their very human reactions.
                            Obviously, it is for this reason that politicians must control those

                            willing to describe as a political quantum jump. The strategic hamlet

                            designed as a political revolution. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> means to
                            build democracy at the hamlet level, give the people a stake in the

                            the common struggle and contributions to it in place of the traditional

                            the easiest and most promising course for us is to join
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> on this one. I don't think we can get a
                            quantum jump, but steady progress and the defeat of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> do seem possible.</p>
                        <p>4. We have already a factual if not a formal alliance with
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> on this one. Our support for strategic
                            hamlets has begun to move and will be accelerated. The following may be
                            considered as possible means to sharpen the political focus of our <hi rend="italic">supporting</hi> effort:</p>
                        <p>(a) Ultimately, the modernization of the countryside—i.e. more income and
                            more services for Nguyen van Hai—will depend on more agricultural
                            production, for export. (It is a good Rostowian premise that an
                            agricultural revolution must precede any industrial revolution; if the
                            transition to a modern economy is to be successful, it begins with
                            increased agricultural output. The agricultural Achilles' heel of the
                            Bloc seems to bear him out.) In the past, for domestic and other
                            reasons, we have done very little in Viet-Nam to increase rice
                            production (I believe <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> was formally
                            forbidden to do anything until 1958 or 1959). We skill act as though
                            self-sufficiency in rice is all that is necessary for Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>I certainly know very little about agriculture and economics, but I do
                            know that rice yields in other parts of the world are much higher than
                            in Viet-Nam. I also understand that our demonologists figure the Chicoms
                            could, and perhaps will, increase their rice output dramatically <pb n="572" xml:id="pg_572" facs="0592"/>by known means such as
                            fertilizer, better seed, etc. We have talked a lot about fertilizer and
                            agricultural extension in Viet-Nam, but I think done less than we could.
                            Third country experts (Taiwan, Japan, Italy) might have more to offer
                            than our own technicians on this.</p>
                        <p>I understand the political problem here and abroad of an effort to
                            deliberately and massively increase Viet-Nam's rice exports. Perhaps the
                            reaction could be blunted by a parallel effort to process the rice
                            (alcohol?) and find new uses for it (George Washington Carver van Hai?
                            Plastics from rice? More rice-fed hogs, cattle, chickens, for export?)
                            If we mean business about modernizing the Vietnamese economy and setting
                            it on its own feet in some reasonable length of time, and most of all,
                            if we are serious about wanting to help the peasant, I think it will
                            have to involve an effort to increase rice production and export. The
                            often heard charge that U.S. aid never gets to the peasant is partly
                            true. Could it be because we have never been concerned about the basic
                            source of peasant income—rice?</p>
                        <p>We have an item on agricultural prices in our action program. If I
                            understand the problem, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has
                            deliberately held down agricultural prices, in some cases below
                            production costs. This applies especially to hogs, which used to be
                            exported but now are not. Why not talk to <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> about
                            this, putting it in terms of strategic hamlets, his rural revolution
                            plans and personalism (which stresses the need of an independent
                            economic stake for each citizen). If we talk his language, it may be
                            easier to get through. As for the peasants, an increase in agricultural
                            prices, properly exploited by all media as a <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> policy decision, ought to have an immediate political
                            effect. (It would probably also increase the countryside's absorption of
                            commercial imports over a period of time, thus easing our piaster
                            generation problem.)</p>
                        <p>The losers in this world, of course, be the articulate and powerful
                            salaried bureaucracy; <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> would get pressure from
                            that quarter and from urban areas generally.</p>
                        <p>(b) We have several negative despatches from Montgomery <note n="2" xml:id="d257fn2"> James M. Montgomery, Third Secretary and Vice
                                Consul at Saigon.</note> on land reform. While his case is probably
                            overstated, I think Jim is essentially right in asserting that rent
                            control is a dead letter, that free land from the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> is more attractive than land for sale from the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, and that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> tends to represent landlords more than peasants. In
                            talking with <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>, it might be well to suggest tying
                            the strategic hamlet program to <hi rend="italic">free</hi> distribution
                            of the 260,000 hectares of French lands which the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> now holds and has not yet distributed,
                            possibly as common land (on the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            model) to the strategic hamlets (the rent to support hamlet officials
                            and improvements) or possibly directly to heroes or families of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> victims. This, too, should be exploited
                            by media, as a major <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> policy for the
                            little people's benefit, and could <pb n="573" xml:id="pg_573" facs="0593"/>be coupled with aggressive exposure of Communist land
                            policy in North Viet Nam and elsewhere. Land bought from Vietnamese
                            landlords and still unbought (125,000 hectares) could also be used.</p>
                        <p>Getting rent contracts renewed and enforced is harder, but should not be
                            given up. I do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> believe we should press the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to allow the Farmers Tenant
                            Union to fight for this on the local level because I think it would be
                            unacceptable to <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>, both of whom are at least middling sour on labor
                            unions. But cast simply in terms of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s good faith, <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> might be willing to take some
                            action on the problem. Perhaps the Chinats, speaking from their
                            advisors' experience in the Farmers Associations could back up this
                            ploy. (Those advisors have strong opinions, and seem like pretty good
                            people.)</p>
                        <p>All this to-do about a land reform program which <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> thinks is completed is important
                            because the Communists have apparently made some yardage simply by being
                            against landlords.</p>
                        <p>(c) How about a strategic hamlet congress next spring, with elected
                            representatives from each strategic hamlet, to meet in Saigon, study the
                            program, compare notes on experiences, and advise the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> on future moves? The opportunities for
                            bally-hoo of the peasant reps, medals for the brave defenders, etc.,
                            played back to the countryside by media and word of mouth, would be
                            worth the effort.</p>
                        <p>(d) The <gloss target="#t_CI1">CI</gloss> paper from <gloss target="#t_FSI1">FSI</gloss>
                            <note n="3" xml:id="d257fn3">Not further identified.</note> suggested
                            that National Assembly Deputies go to the country and get the folks
                            (with our help) what they need, i.e. barbed wire, fertilizer, etc., thus
                            making a direct link between the Saigon government and the peasants.
                            This is a risky idea because it suggests <hi rend="italic">we</hi>
                            approach the deputies. I suggest we approach <hi rend="italic">
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>
                            </hi> with the idea of putting the Assembly to work on the strategic
                            hamlets; a National Assembly Deputy <hi rend="italic">could</hi> be a
                            fine civic action cadre and help drum up enthusiasm and support,
                            provided he saw the program as a job and not a chance for personal
                            aggrandizement. Perhaps the Deputies could be attached to the
                            appropriate Division Commander chairman of the strategic hamlet regional
                            committees as special advisors and inspectors or something. They are
                            talented and loyal people for the most part, and the Assembly does not
                            demand all of their energies, by any means; there should be some way to
                            tie them into the strategic hamlet effort.</p>
                        <p>(e) The key to a political revolution in the countryside is the attitude
                            of the people toward government, <hi rend="italic">any</hi> government.
                            This in turn depends, at least in part, on the attitude of the officials
                            toward their own role. This is a long-term problem and basically a
                            question of education. Training and retraining officials is one approach
                            we should continue to study and pursue. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is pretty sensitive on the subject, however, and I am
                            not sure that we have so much to offer,<pb n="574" xml:id="pg_574" facs="0594"/> anyhow. Do we really have the experts and the methods
                            which could convert the provincial bureaucracy, even if we had unlimited
                            power to impose them? I doubt it. We should offer our assistance on this
                            one continue to indicate that we think it is a basic need, back up
                            people like Colonel Thao who do seem to be able to train effective
                            officials and assume a bit of humility.</p>
                        <p>(f) As education is the key to vertical mobility for many Vietnamese, an
                            effort might be made through scholarships to capture the loyalty of
                            those young Vietnamese who might otherwise seek to shoot their way to
                            position and prestige with the Viet Cong. At the hamlet level, this
                            could be tied to active participation in the hamlet defense unit,
                            heroism under fire, etc., the candidates to be selected by popular
                            secret ballot. Or the Republican Youth might be the proper instrument
                            for selecting these young people. Their training might be in subjects
                            useful to them personally, i.e. an avenue to government service by the
                            acquiring of a high school education, or to the hamlet generally (health
                            technicians, mid-wives, mechanics) by providing a needed skill. In urban
                            areas, it could extend even to scholarships for higher education, to be
                            used as a means of stimulating participation in various <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> programs such as the Republican
                            Youth.</p>
                        <p>(g) We should continue to give all the support we can to Can's Force
                            Populaire. Because of the difficulty of recruiting people with
                            sufficient intelligence <hi rend="italic">and</hi> sufficient motivation
                            to do this work properly, I doubt that it can be more than a partial
                            response to the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. Getting people to
                            defend themselves and their stake in the hamlet is probably easier, and
                            the strategic hamlet program should remain our top priority, even in
                            CVN. As Helble noted, however, these programs are not mutually
                            exclusive. And Can's idea is more political than
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>'s in some ways. At least mention it to
                            Rostow, along with our support for it.</p>
                        <p>Motivation for the Force Populaire might be increased by a stake in land
                            or money, to be paid at the end, say, of two years service. Or
                            scholarships might be offered to outstanding members.</p>
                        <p>Probably the possibility of applying the Force Populaire idea to the
                            delta provinces is already under study in Saigon. I would guess that it
                            is not readily applicable there, however.</p>
                        <p>5. At the national level, I do not think that the opposition can be
                            persuaded to work with <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> or he
                            with them. Nor do I think any useful purpose will be served if they are
                            allowed to generate more divisive forces at this time. Oppositionists in
                            the government or a legal opposition outside of the government will not
                            be helpful or possible at this time. Public criticism of the government
                            now would be interpreted by most Vietnamese, many of the Saigon
                            intellectuals included, as a sign of weakness, if not imminent collapse.
                            When the Viet Cong are <pb n="575" xml:id="pg_575" facs="0595"/>dearly
                            on the run, something dramatic like a legal opposition with its own
                            newspaper and forum might be useful in meeting the needs of the elite
                            groups and the foreign press. Not now.</p>
                        <p>6. Our chief effort at the national level should continue to be a gradual
                            improvement in the efficiency of the whole <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, military and civilian. Our people are doing this in a
                            multitude of ways, with the help of <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> and other allies. Progress will continue—and
                            will probably continue to be slow. Perhaps we should raise with
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> again the National
                            Security Council and its proper use, but <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> is the best judge of that.</p>
                        <p>7. We should encourage the efforts which the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has been making to develop channels for complaints from
                            the people (not the oppositionists) to the central government. This
                            could perhaps be beefed up to cabinet level and given a great deal more
                            publicity.</p>
                        <p>8. We should also encourage the continuing effort to prune the provincial
                            bureaucracy of corrupt or abusive officials. (The press accounts of this
                            campaign sound good, but we need provincial reporting to check it out.)
                            This item can be tied to seven (above), perhaps as part of the function
                            of a complaints cabinet officer.</p>
                        <p>9. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> should be encouraged to take a
                            more aggressive and more positive posture with regard to reunification.
                            It cannot afford to seem to acquiesce in the continued division of Viet
                            Nam while the Commies plump for reunification on their own terms.
                            Perhaps the National Assembly should include Deputies representing the
                            northern part of the country (as the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            does with the south), the Assembly committee on reunification should be
                            more active and get press attention, and a cabinet position might be
                            created for the study and coordination of efforts to peacefully reunite
                            Viet-Nam. The pitch should be militant without being threatening. This
                            is difficult, but could be done. Perhaps the main thrust would be that
                            Communism is a temporary aberration and that after a few years more of
                            hunger and failure the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> leadership
                            will be compelled by its own people to abandon its Communist
                            doctrines.</p>

                            forms U.S. aid. We consider next year to be crucial in counterinsurgency

                            (especially Strategic Hamlet Program), state of rural economy, and
                            military events (including all types <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            pressures) are combining in present period to open way for rapid and
                            profound changes in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. One example
                            already in evidence is Montagnard exodus mounting to major proportions.
                            Widespread efforts in rural hamlets bearing heavily on lives of ordinary
                            people, offer great opportunity, and at same time great risks if <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> able to prevent fulfillment of hopes of

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Urgency</p>
                        <p>This seems evident: (a) that as result social, political, military
                            pressures accumulating at accelerating rate, next 6-12 months will be
                            period of crisis in sense that either great improvement in situation or
                            considerable deterioration could ensue; (b) that our side on hia1 with
                            tremendous opportunity for progress if it can be seized, and grave <pb n="577" xml:id="pg_577" facs="0597"/>dangers if it is not. Important
                            note specifically that several <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>,
                            U.S.-supported, programs have made commitments and raised hopes, which
                            could boomerang disastrously if not followed through, e.g. strategic
                            hamlets, still largely in construction/population control stage awaiting
                            improvements of civil programs.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Program Based on Events, Not Independent
                            Planning</p>
                        <p>Another aspect of situation relating particularly to American aid program
                            is that, while U.S. able influence events, it is not able to “program”
                            or control them, nor cause them to adhere to schedule of its choice, nor
                            to await its decisions. In FY 63 significant results will be obtainable
                            from aid efforts only if they tied in with principal current <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> programs, and only if such efforts
                            applied at time events require them. Our program must be defined, in
                            other words, as support of and influence on forces in motion in present
                            struggle, rather than as self-sufficient plan or side scope of fluid
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>We not proposing at this time, therefore, a static 12 months' program
                            fixed in detail since neither developments in the country nor activities
                            and programs which may need support can be assessed far in advance.
                            Planning approach include (a) calculation order of magnitude 12 months'
                            requirement; (b) calculation of detailed initial requirements; (c)
                            establishment of adequate personnel capability and minimum, revolving,
                            supply inventory of major items (requirement for which will be common to
                            a number of potential programs); (d) action immediately on programs and
                            plans ready to move (without compromising, but without waiting for,
                            final 63 plans and program approval); (e) firming up over next 5-6
                            months succeeding tranches of total program.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Rationale</p>
                        <p>Major shift in emphasis planned for 63 program (as against 62) from:
                            ordinary economic development (of infrastructure, etc) with trickle down
                            benefits, managed through central government as national programs, to:
                            direct injection in rural economy and society, through decentralized
                            machinery of benefits to individual communities and measures enabling
                            communities produce benefits for selves. Rationale for shift, of which
                            experience in 62 makes us more certain than ever, is that outcome of
                            struggle dependent on tangible direct evidence <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> capacity improve economic and social life. There is
                            good prospect for action on such programs by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and province authorities, and we aim associate much our
                            own action with them. Initiative at this level appears also be main
                            chance for strengthening representative and democratic processes in
                            hamlet/village society without which crucial economic, social
                            improvement not likely occur, or, if occurring, not likely translate
                            into satisfaction towards regime.</p>

                        <p>“Public Aid” Program (as distinguished from commercial aid) will include
                            four major segments:</p>
                        <p>(a) Ongoing development work (such as technical education, crop
                            improvement, town water supply) proportionately reduced from similar
                            activities in 62 and amounting roughly 6.5 percent total dollar cost.
                            Includes also programs seeking influence policies and improve

                            and village people, and, (b) inter-village/district works where outside

                            become principal instrument in pacification effort). Thus, full-year
                            requirement is order magnitude and lends itself to continuous refinement

                        <p>Dear Fritz: I have just lunched with Mike Forrestal who, as you know, is
                            assuming much of the responsibility as the President's liaison man on
                            the Far East. He regretted that he could not come to Viet-Nam after the
                            Laos Conference and hopes to do so soon.</p>
                        <p>I will catalogue briefly the most interesting matters which we discussed,
                            saving the most important item for the last:</p>
                        <p>1) He will smoke out Bill Trueheart's papers which have been moldering in
                            the White House for some time.</p>
                        <p>2) Papers asking the President's decision on mangrove destruction are now
                            in the White House and the President has promised to read them today. A
                            controlled approval is anticipated.</p>
                        <p>3) Crop destruction was shot down in State and the prospects are not
                            good. However, I hope to get a paper to the White House which, while
                            giving State's disapproval, will at least contain the pros and cons of
                            this project. The matter will reach the White House since Defense is
                            submitting a separate memorandum favoring the project.<note n="2" xml:id="d259fn2">
                                <ref target="#d262">Document 262</ref>.</note> The objections are
                            centered around the Governor's general feeling that destroying crops by
                            helicopters, even though flown by Vietnamese, will be a dramatic and
                            frightening demonstration of white man's weapons used against Asian
                            food. And secondly, how can we be sure that we are destroying food for
                            Viet Cong use only, at a time when it is important to not only bring the
                            Montagnards over to our side but also to send them back to their homes
                            or at least to areas where their patrols can be useful. I enclose a copy
                            of the memorandum on crop destruction which has been disapproved by
                            Messrs. <persName>Johnson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>. I am going to slip a copy to <persName corresp="#p_FGD1">Des FitzGerald</persName> this afternoon with a
                            request that the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> prepare a
                            memorandum for the White House in terms of its effect on the
                            Montagnards, having in mind their extensive programs with these
                            people.</p>
                        <p>4) The Secretary is lunching with eleven <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> Ambassadors next
                            week and you will be glad to know that Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> feels very strongly that the
                            Secretary should emphasize that the conference on Laos was in no sense a
                            model for Viet-Nam. <persName corresp="#p_FLMV1">Forrestal</persName>
                            <pb n="581" xml:id="pg_581" facs="0601"/>thinks our best argument is
                            that this is a Vietnamese war and we cannot presume to drag them to the
                            peace table when they are fighting for their independence. This leads to
                            the final topic.</p>
                        <p>5) There is here a general feeling from the President down that we must
                            continue our effort to support Viet-Nam. This is coupled at the top
                            levels with a sense that there is lacking evaluations as to how the war
                            is going. In view of the number of reports which Task Force Saigon is
                            sending in this seems hard to believe, but it was accurately reflected
                            by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> at
                            Honolulu. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s feeling is
                            shared by the President, Rostow,<note n="3" xml:id="d259fn3">See my
                                letter of August 2 to Bill Trueheart. Rostow has since relaxed on
                                the idea of a “political quantum jump”. [Footnote in the source
                                text. The August 2 letter has not been found.]</note>

                            feeling that possibly in October when the rains stop in Viet-Nam and
                            Congress stops in the United States, the President should make a strong
                            speech explaining our position in Viet-Nam to the American public and
                            seeking to rally support behind our policy. <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mike</persName> completely recognized the full and detailed
                            reporting from Saigon. However, the large number of place names,
                            statistics, and casualty figures, while invaluable to the experts and
                            therefore necessary in Washington, appear to be somewhat confusing to
                            the top level reader who only has a relatively short time to keep up
                            with Viet-Nam. May I therefore most humbly suggest that you send in a
                            telegram giving your own personal judgement on how the war is going, say
                            once a month. This would ignore the reporting requirements of the
                            various action programs. <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mike</persName> is
                            certain that if you, as a wise and experienced Ambassador, write such a
                            Letter From Viet-Nam it will be most helpful to the President and the
                            members of the Cabinet most immediately concerned. Among other things it
                            would help him in thinking over the type of speech which he may be
                            willing to give later on Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>I am going to try and take two other steps (on which more later) that may
                            be of some use in meeting this problem:</p>
                        <p>a) Bring in Tom Ainsworth, an <gloss target="#t_FSO1">FSO</gloss> who
                            knows Viet-Nam but is not immediately connected with this Task Force and
                            will therefore not be suspected of being too ardently pro-Vietnamese. I
                            hope he can spend ten days in our files and write up a paper based on
                            material in them in order to give a stop-gap evaluation of the situation
                            in Viet-Nam and incidentally to demonstrate that we do get a lot of
                            reporting from Saigon.</p>
                        <p>b) If it is possible, we will try to arrange to send Bill Jorden and Ted
                            Heavner to Viet-Nam for a month and, if you have no objection, it might

                        <p>126. In course conversation with Richardson and me yesterday, <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> reported following items:</p>
                        <p>1. A meeting at Ministerial level was held August 4 on Montagnard
                            problem, attended by all concerned <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            ministries and agencies. Definite decision taken to encourage by all
                            means possible exodus Montagnard population from areas controlled by
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> to areas control by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. Montagnards would be encouraged to
                            come to nearest suitable government-controlled areas, generally within
                            their own provinces thus minimizing distances of evacuation. They would
                            be resettled to provide (a) maximum security, and (b) maximum economic
                            advantages. Where these principles conflicted, security comes first.
                            Already substantial migration, plus expected increase resulting from
                            news government relief and rehabilitation activities, impose necessity
                            cutting back on certain agreed uses of counterpart fund in order to
                            provide for Montagnards. It had been agreed by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to seek US concurrence; also to seek such direct aid as
                            US might be able to provide. I said we would be quite willing to discuss
                            financing, since we heartily endorse principle of encouraging Montagnard
                            exodus from areas where they could not defend themselves, against being
                            used by <pb n="583" xml:id="pg_583" facs="0603"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. In this connection, <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said that migration of
                            Montagnards had already left many growing crops available for <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> harvesting and use, and current plan to
                            encourage movement would augment this. He urged again a favorable answer
                            re selective use chemicals for spraying crops, emphasizing that month of
                            August is harvest time for many crops in certain areas. I told him that
                            this matter was still under consideration in Washington and that I would
                            do my best to get policy decision promptly.</p>
                        <p>2. Referring to recent <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> military
                            successes, especially by 7th division, Thuan said that available
                            information from <gloss target="#t_POW1">POW</gloss>'s, documents, etc.
                            strongly reinforced his conviction that <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> concentrating, both by regrouping within country and by
                            infiltration for major large-scale offensive in central Viet-Nam
                            (precise area uncertain) in order establish bridgehead for puppet
                            liberation government. I expressed view that such an attempt might well
                            play into our hands, since our side should command great superiority in
                            pitched-battle type warfare. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> did not seem particularly reassured by this
                            observation.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Yesterday you asked what the particular trouble spots were in the Far
                            East now that the immediate crises in Laos and Indonesia have been toned
                            down. In order of their urgency, I should imagine that the following are
                            the current problems.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">South Vietnam</p>
                        <p>I have a hunch that the six months beginning after the end of the rainy
                            season in November will be critical in South Vietnam. It is during this
                            period that we will have a clearer indication of whether the steps we
                            have taken in that country are, in the long run, going to be <pb n="584" xml:id="pg_584" facs="0604"/>productive. The level of military
                            activity will undoubtedly increase and, as a result, there will be more
                            casualties—including Americans. Public opinion in this country will
                            probably support such casualties if on balance it seems that we are
                            getting somewhere. If, on the other hand, it looks as though our
                            attempts to improve the military, economic and social situation at
                            village level in South Vietnam are being frustrated by our own
                            inefficiency or <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s
                            recalcitrance, we will be in for real trouble.</p>
                        <p>At the moment I suspect that our pressures on <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> are a little too slow acting and need to be stepped
                            up even at some risk.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>This memorandum recommends U.S. support of a pilot program for Vietnamese
                            crop destruction operations against the Viet Cong. The direct operation
                            itself would be carried out entirely by Government of Vietnam personnel
                            using their own helicopters. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> has consistently advocated the use of herbicides,
                            particularly for crop destruction. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> stated at my Honolulu
                            conference on July 23<note n="2" xml:id="d262fn2">See <ref target="#d248">Document 248</ref>.</note> that a major limiting
                            factor on Viet Cong infiltrators into the country is how to keep them
                            fed. On the basis of extensive evaluation, I am satisfied that crop
                            destruction, even in sections of one province, could provide a
                            substantial military advantage.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> and General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> have recommended,
                            and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> has
                            concurred, in a proposal for the Vietnamese to conduct a trial program
                            of chemical crop destruction in Viet Cong territory of eight target
                            areas totaling 2,500 acres (located within the marked square on attached
                                maps)<note n="3" xml:id="d262fn3">Neither found.</note> in Phu Yen
                            Province. This experimental program, which the Vietnamese are now
                            capable of attempting from the standpoint of technology, would be
                            integrated closely with the Hai Yen II clear-and-hold and resettlement
                            operation now in progress <pb n="585" xml:id="pg_585" facs="0605"/>in
                            Phu Yen. The best available political and military intelligence
                            indicates a considerable Viet Cong presence in the target area, and this
                            data would be reevaluated against information collected up to the
                            launching of the program.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of extensive briefing and their evaluation of the technical
                            factors and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> preparations, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> and General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> are convinced
                            that crop destruction should be undertaken and that the material and
                            herbicides to be employed are technically effective. They are further
                            convinced that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> methods of
                            determining targets, based on the best available ground and air
                            intelligence, take into account all necessary factors. The Military
                            Assistance Command, Vietnam, staff is in a position to render adequate
                            technical advice.</p>
                        <p>Many Montagnard tribesmen have abandoned this area in recent months, and
                            they are being resettled or assisted as an integral part of the Hai Yen
                            II operation. Their crops should not be left for the Viet Cong to
                            harvest. The Viet Cong also have crop programs in their mountain redoubt
                            areas. Denial of food supplies would assist in forcing the Viet Cong out
                            of the target area, an objective of the overall clear-and-hold
                            operation.</p>
                        <p>You have previously directed that food-denial operations would be
                            undertaken only after a careful basis for resettlement and alternative
                            food supply had been created. The operation in Phu Yen, which is similar
                            to Operation Sunrise, meets these conditions. This would be the first
                            trial of both the strategic hamlet concept and the complemental
                            food-denial operations since the successful campaign in Malaya.</p>
                        <p>There is ample precedent for food-denial operations within Vietnam. Both
                            the Government and Viet Cong have consistently engaged in crop burning
                            as a routine part of operations for a number of years. The efficiency of
                            chemical sprays delivered by helicopters is in marked contrast, however.
                            A single helicopter can spray one acre in about five seconds with very
                            effective defoliant chemicals. The inaccessibility by ground routes of
                            much of this target area has been its primary defense in the past, so
                            that large numbers of plots have with impunity been devoted to crops to
                            support the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>The only possible drawback anticipated is in the psychological area. The
                            proposed operation will doubtless give rise to Communist and some
                            neutralist propaganda, but Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> believes that its effect will be relatively
                            negligible. American participation would be as unobtrusive as possible

                            in Washington and Saigon. The final draft of the paper, dated August 14,
                            noted the following:</p>
                        <p>“The basic U.S. objective of keeping the Republic of Viet-nam an
                            independent and viable nation requires an integrated plan of action,
                            including political, economic, military, psychological … operations in
                            Viet-nam. These activities, both U.S. and Vietnamese, should be focused
                            on five key problems which must be solved in order to achieve our

                            in Vietnam in relation to psychology of Vietnamese people. This
                            discussion held in context rather optimistic assessment by Thuan of
                            current developments here.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> led into subject by
                            mentioning report <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> had that <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> predicted as inevitable some sort of
                            parley between North and South Vietnam “in a year”. He said
                                Lalouette<note n="3" xml:id="d265fn3"> Roger Lalouette, French
                                Ambassador in the Republic of Vietnam.</note> was extremely vague in
                            describing this idea, but <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> definitely
                            smelt a rat. (See also FVS-7799<note n="4" xml:id="d265fn4">Not
                                found.</note> for account of <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>'s suspicions.)
                            I said I had not detected any such thought in conversations with
                            Lalouette since his return from Paris. On contrary, he had told me
                                <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> was firmly behind policy line
                            which US pursuing in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and that <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> realized, as well as we do, that
                            Laos-type settlement is not applicable to Vietnam problem.</p>
                        <p>We also discussed UK attitude, and agreed that UK policy vis-à-vis
                            Vietnam is firm and realistic increasingly so.</p>
                        <p>Thuan then questioned me seriously on possible shift in US policy
                            vis-à-vis <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, mentioning inter alia a
                            garbled report he had heard of Secretary's talks with Barcroft [<hi rend="italic">Barwick</hi>] at recent ANZUS meeting.<note n="5" xml:id="d265fn5">During the ANZUS Council meeting at Canberra, May
                                8-9, Rusk told Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BSGEJ1">Barwick</persName> that the United States would welcome

                                Vietnam. (Memorandum of conversation; Department of State,
                                Conference Files: Lot 65 D 533, CF 2105)</note> I told him on basis
                            all information available to me, including recent talks in Honolulu, US
                            policy vis-à-vis <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> was firmly fixed on
                            achievement of immediate objective here and we were not interested at
                            this time in looking into distant future to try to formulate
                            hypothetical ultimate solutions. The immediate problem is obviously to
                            restore governmental control, law and order throughout <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and to promote conditions in which
                            people of South Vietnam could work towards their chosen social,
                            political, and economic aspirations without intimidation. Many people
                            inquired about the “ultimate solution” to Vietnam problem. I thought it
                            wise to avoid being drawn into public speculation on this subject. To
                            say that one is against ultimate reunification of the Vietnamese people
                            is obviously bad politics; to say that <pb n="589" xml:id="pg_589" facs="0609"/>one is in favor of reunification risks
                            misinterpretation, and undermines will to resist in South. Thus, it
                            seemed to me wise to fix attention on immediate objective and refuse to
                            speculate about long-range future. This, I thought, was about essence of
                            US position, and I saw no reason to suppose that it would change in
                            foreseeable future. I added, that, in discussions with new Indian
                            Chairman of <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>, as well as with his
                            predecessor, I had tried to get across idea that best role for <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> also was to try to help promote
                            restoration of peace in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> in limited
                            frame, without seeking overall or ultimate solutions to Vietnam
                            problem—in other words, a “live and let live” objective.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said he agreed with this
                            and President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> did too,
                            although he could not take a public position in favor of a divided
                            Vietnam. He added that he frequently told his <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> colleagues that they had no reason to fear shift in US
                            position provided <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> stuck to task at
                            hand and made progress in pacification and development of country.</p>
                        <p>On subject of war-weariness as factor in <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> success, I suggested to <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> that we may be approaching time when a definite
                            shift in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> psychological line should
                            be made. By end this year, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> security
                            forces in all categories will be developed and strengthened very greatly
                            (two new divisions, trained and equipped <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>, mobility,
                            striking power, intelligence, etc.); clear and hold operations, coupled
                            with strategic hamlets, would be well underway; Montagnard training for
                            self-defense and/or resettlement well along. Perhaps <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> should begin to point to light at end
                            of tunnel, which may be not far away. This line can be made credible and
                            I suggested that he and President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> should think seriously about fixing eyes of South
                            Vietnamese people on achievement of peace and fruits thereof within
                            relatively near future. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>
                            agreed that President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> should
                            move in this direction and that we should work together to inject this
                            note of hope into his public speeches.</p>

                        <p>If we will win in Viet-Nam with defoliants, but lose without them, then
                            we must use them. If we will probably win with defoliants and probably
                            lose without them, then also we must use them. If we might win with
                            defoliants, and might win without them, then we had better consider the
                            implications before undertaking the project proposed by the Department
                            of Defense for 2,500 acres in Phu Yen Province.</p>
                        <p>We have a tradition in this country of not using food as a weapon of war.
                            Chemical and biological warfare are subjects which arouse emotional
                            reactions at least as intense as those aroused by nuclear warfare, as
                            witnessed by the publicity surrounding the recent accidental death of
                            the British scientist, our Korean and East German experiences, and the
                            recent Indian incidents. A series by Rachel Carson currently running in
                            the <hi rend="italic">New Yorker</hi> and soon to be published in book
                            form sets forth with devastating impact the consequences of insecticides
                            on insect-plant life balance and human health. The Agriculture
                            Department is concerned about the implications of this book for our
                            foreign crop marketing; if we launch a defoliation program in Viet-Nam
                            our enemies and many of our friends will use this book against us.</p>
                        <p>Depriving the Viet Cong of their local food supplies and forcing them
                            onto the open plain where they can more easily be dealt with is a
                            legitimate and necessary military objective. But what are the
                            alternative methods of achieving this objective? Have all been tried and
                            have all failed? Given the relative predictability of the growing
                            season, can not the Viet Cong be ambushed or otherwise prevented from
                            harvesting these crops?</p>
                        <p>No matter how reasonable our case may be. I am convinced that we cannot
                            persuade the world—particularly that large part of it which does not get
                            enough to eat—that defoliation “is good for you.” Nonetheless, should
                            the President decide to proceed with the project, it is <pb n="591" xml:id="pg_591" facs="0611"/>important that we be given a brief
                            period to explain to the world exactly what we are doing and why. This
                            will reduce, to some extent, the impact of the inevitable Communist
                            propaganda campaign.</p>

                        <p>Before leaving for Maine I would like to make a few comments regarding
                            the proposed mission to Southeast Asia which we first discussed a month
                            or so ago.<note n="2" xml:id="d267fn2">See <ref target="#d241">Document

                        <p>I gather from our talk last Friday<note n="3" xml:id="d267fn3">No record

                                    <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> on Friday, August 10,
                                has been found.</note> that the Far East Bureau is strongly opposed
                            to the proposal, and that under the circumstances you feel that the
                            mission should be abandoned or postponed.</p>
                        <p>Although I bow to any decision which you may wish to make I would like to
                            offer a strong personal dissent from the <hi rend="italic">reasoning</hi> that appears to have led the Bureau to oppose the
                            core of my proposal: A speech by the President outlining U.S. political,
                            economic and military objectives in the area.</p>
                        <p>The arguments as stated in a memorandum to my office on July 31 (a copy
                            of which I am enclosing)<note n="4" xml:id="d267fn4">Not found, but see
                                    <ref target="#d253">Document 253</ref>.</note> strike me as
                            specious in the extreme. If these views prevail I believe we will have
                            lost our opportunity to recapture the political initiative in that part
                            of the world, and for this reason I am anxious to have my own views
                            fully understood. Let us first consider the Bureau's objections.</p>
                        <p>The memorandum argues that there is no point in the President asking the
                            Southeast Asian nations to restate their opposition to the use of force
                            since they are already on record through the U.N. Charter and because
                            our Communist opponents cannot be expected to live up <pb n="592" xml:id="pg_592" facs="0612"/>to whatever verbal commitments they
                            might make for tactical purposes. If we adopted this view as <hi rend="italic">national</hi> policy we would abandon the entire peace
                            initiative to the Communists.</p>
                        <p>The memorandum then discounts the value of any “paper guarantees” that we
                            might obtain from the U.S.S.R. or Communist China, in regard to overt
                            aggression in Southeast Asia, and ridicules the suggestion that broader
                            international inspection machinery might be effective in curbing
                            internal subversion. While experience may prove their pessimism to be
                            correct, this view is contrary to the assumptions on which the Laotian
                            negotiations and the Geneva agreements have been based, i.e., that the
                            Soviets in Southeast Asia as in the case of Austria may carry out
                            whatever agreements they believe to be in their interest; and that if
                            their interests in this area should coincide with ours there is some
                            hope of curbing the more overt forms of internal subversion.</p>
                        <p>The memorandum also asserts that there is no hope now or in the
                            foreseeable future that Southeast Asian nations may be willing to forego
                            some degree of sovereignty in order to increase regional economic and
                            political cooperation.</p>
                        <p>This judgment appears particularly defeatist in light of the new
                            Malaysian Federation, the recent proposals by <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>, ASA's tentative early steps
                            toward closer economic cooperation, and the support already demonstrated
                            by the four riparian countries for the development of the Mekong.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the memorandum asserts that what the North Vietnamese really
                            need is a good stiff military lesson and until we have given them that
                            lesson we will be wasting our time in attempting to create a less
                            negative U.S. posture in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of such reasoning <persName corresp="#p_WDM1">Wilson</persName>'s Fourteen Points could be condemned as an empty
                            gesture, Secretary Marshall's 1947 speech at Harvard viewed as a
                            visionary bit of do-goodism, Truman's Point Four proposals as
                            unrealistic, the Alliance for Progress as a blatant case of
                            international day dreaming, and The Ten Commandments as the ultimate in
                            utopianism.</p>
                        <p>Let me again briefly state my position in regard to Southeast Asia:</p>
                        <p>1. My hat goes off to Averell <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> for his brilliant performance in negotiating
                            the Laos agreement. Had he been bound by the paralyzing inhibitions laid
                            down in the attached memorandum, we would never have reached that
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>If the Soviet Union should choose to live up to its agreements (and
                            Averell would be the first to agree that this is a crucial “if”) we may
                            be able to work our way out of a miserable situation which we inherited
                            from the previous administration and gradually to create a relatively
                            stable Laos, neutral and independent.</p>
                        <pb n="593" xml:id="pg_593" facs="0613"/>
                        <p>On the other hand if the Soviet Union <hi rend="italic">fails</hi> to
                            live up to its side of the bargain it will be clear to everyone in
                            Southeast Asia and throughout the world as to who wants peace and who
                            wants trouble, and the stage will be set for whatever may follow.</p>
                        <p>2. At present we are faced with a most difficult security situation in
                            South Vietnam. Although our military authorities appear hopeful about
                            the outcome, qualified <hi rend="italic">outside</hi> observers place
                            the odds for a clear cut victory at less than fifty-fifty.</p>
                        <p>If, as many fear, the situation deteriorates we may be forced within the
                            next year or so to choose between committing more and more American
                            troops and material to what the President's political opponents will
                            describe as “another Democratic War” or withdrawing in embarrassed
                            frustration.</p>
                        <p>For the U.S. Government to adopt the classic “let's wait and see” posture
                            under such circumstances strikes me as not only sterile but
                            foolhardy.</p>
                        <p>3. Since F.D.R.'s efforts to persuade the French to leave Indo China in
                            1945 and our efforts in 1948 on behalf of Indonesian independence, the
                            U.S. has drifted into a singularly negative posture throughout Southeast
                            Asia.</p>
                        <p>This has been due in part to our involvement with Chinese Nationalist
                            troops in North Burma, to our strong military support for the French
                            prior to their defeat at Dien Bien Phu, to our alleged effort to upset
                            the Sukarno government in 1958, to our close association with the
                            Nationalist Chinese government on Taiwan, and to our support of such
                            right wing Southeast Asian leaders as <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>, Bao Dai, Sarit, and Phoumi.</p>
                        <p>Thanks to our role in negotiating the Geneva agreements and the near
                            settlement in West Irian, our prestige is starting to rise. However, it
                            still has a long way to go.</p>
                        <p>4. In these circumstances the most effective course of American policy,
                            in my opinion, should be along the following lines:</p>
                        <p>a. Continue to make it clear that we will massively oppose any overt
                            Communist effort to take over Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>b. Continue our strong military support for the <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> government in its opposition to
                            the Communists in South Vietnam, while pressing <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> more vigorously to broaden his
                            political base and to institute essential administrative and economic
                            reforms.</p>
                        <p>c. Discreetly keep our eyes open for an alternative to <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> who would provide a broader
                            political base from which to oppose the Communists.</p>

                            careful not to embrace him so fondly that he will be dismissed as a new

                            is urgently necessary for the U.S. Government to clarify its overall
                            objectives in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>I believe that this can best be accomplished through a carefully
                            conceived statement by the President of the United States, patterned on
                            the concept of <persName corresp="#p_WDM1">Wilson</persName>'s Fourteen
                            Points, in which he would outline the kind of Southeast Asia we are
                            striving to build <hi rend="italic">once the fighting in Vietnam has
                                been halted.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I believe that the proposed outline of such a speech which I attached to
                            my June 13 memorandum to the President<note n="5" xml:id="d267fn5">
                                <ref target="#d214">Document 214</ref>.</note> and the 15 points
                            which were included in my July 18 memorandum<note n="6" xml:id="d267fn6">See the Attachment to <ref target="#d241">Document
                                241</ref>.</note> to you are generally valid. They can be
                            substantially improved, however, as a result of constructive discussions
                            in the Department of State and White House.</p>
                        <p>In my opinion a visit by me to the area would be useful at some stage in
                            this situation. However, it is in no sense essential to the speech or
                            statement which I think the President should make on the earliest
                            practicable occasion.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">A personal note:</hi> As you know, I have been deeply
                            concerned about many phases of U.S. foreign policy in Southeast Asia and
                            indeed in all of Asia between Tehran and Seoul. To an uncomfortable
                            degree I believe we still remain captives of actions by the past
                            administration and of right wing associations and commitments which we
                            inherited twenty months ago.</p>
                        <p>To base U.S. policy in Southeast Asia on the optimistic assumption that
                            we are about to teach the Communists a hard lesson in Vietnam and that
                            other matters can wait sounds perilously similar to the posture of the
                            French in the early 1950's. At best it is putting our eggs in a basket
                            of questionable durability.</p>
                        <p>In a political sense an “American bastion” in Southeast Asia is a dead
                            end street even if it were feasible militarily. Our best hope for
                            stability in this area lies in the development of a <hi rend="italic">buffer concept</hi> into which we can draw most elements of the
                            non-Communist left and right with the neutral orientation which has
                            effectively curbed Communism in India, Burma, Indonesia and Cambodia.
                            (As <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mike Mansfield</persName> recently
                            suggested, the two Southeast Asian countries which have been <hi rend="italic">least</hi> closely connected with us—Cambodia and
                            Burma—have been the most free of Communist pressure.)</p>
                        <pb n="595" xml:id="pg_595" facs="0615"/>
                        <p>The prospects for a successful Laotian operation are moderately
                            encouraging. The U.S.S.R. is far away and the harried Chinese Communists
                            are steadily losing their capacity either to frighten or to persuade the
                            nations of this area.</p>
                        <p>I believe that our national interests will best be served by disengaging
                            ourselves from the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> concept and
                            encouraging a buffer area approach—as a means of undercutting the
                            position of the Viet Cong and as a basis for the regional development of
                            the entire area when the fighting is over.</p>
                        <p>Even if this effort fails I believe that our overall position in
                            Southeast Asia will be strengthened, and our objectives clarified before
                            world opinion.</p>
                        <p>The several memoranda which I have written to you and the President on
                            Asia in general and this area in particular are based on intimate study
                            of and association with these countries and many of their leaders over
                            the last decade.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of this experience, I was outspokenly critical of the
                            negativism of U.S. policy in Asia during the eight years of the last
                            administration. As the President's Adviser on Asian policy I am troubled
                            to see the same kind of thinking still deeply rooted at the operational
                            levels of the Department as illustrated by this memorandum.</p>
                        <p>The Geneva settlement provides the basis for something more affirmative.
                            Let's build on it.</p>
                        <p>A good place to start is with an affirmative statement by the President
                            in which he boldly spells out U.S. political, military and economic
                            objectives in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>This could give us the <hi rend="italic">initiative</hi> in Asia for the
                            first time since Mao Tse-tung conquered China.</p>

                        <p>I have prepared this memorandum in accordance with your request that I
                            set down my views on the Viet-Nam problem. It is confined to
                            fundamentals, and makes no attempt to deal with other aspects of
                            relative importance.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Situation</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">1959-1962.</hi> The Viet Cong have increased their
                            armed regulars in South Viet-Nam from roughly 2,000 in late 1959 to
                            about 20,000 today. The latter figure has remained fairly stationary
                            during 1962, but in view of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> claims
                            of heavy Viet Cong casualties each month the Viet Cong obviously
                            continue to be readily able to replace large losses. Infiltration from
                            North Viet-Nam is not to be belittled as a source of this strength, but
                            the majority of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> forces have been
                            locally recruited and continue to be so.</p>
                        <p>In late 1959 the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> had effective
                            control over almost all of South Viet-Nam (except for old Communist base
                            areas like the Plaine des Joncs). One could travel, at least by day,
                            almost anywhere in Viet-Nam without escort, and in Central Viet-Nam
                            security was virtually absolute. Today the Viet Cong effectively control
                            large areas of the countryside except when <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> security forces enter in adequate numbers, and much of
                            the rest of the countryside oscillates between the two sides. Real
                            government control is largely confined to the cities and towns.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Current Trend.</hi> While the rapid deterioration of
                            September-October, 1961, especially in anti-Communist morale, was
                            stopped by increased U.S. military aid and improvements in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> military capabilities, the present
                            overall security trend continues gradually against us. In the Central
                            Viet-Nam lowlands provinces security has seriously deteriorated during
                            1962. The Central Viet-Nam highlands provinces are, on the other hand,
                            in better shape than at the end <pb n="597" xml:id="pg_597" facs="0617"/>of 1961, but this seems attributable, in part at any rate, to Viet
                            Cong shift in focus from that area to the lowlands where ethnic
                            Vietnamese recruits and food are available.</p>
                        <p>In southern Viet-Nam (the provinces south and immediately to the north of
                            Saigon) the military situation is superficially a stand-off, but it is
                            actually somewhat in our disfavor as Communist-initiated incidents
                            continue at a high level and the populace is thus not getting effective
                            government protection. Isolated areas (like Father Hoa's area at the
                            southern tip of Viet-Nam) have improved, but they represent the
                            exception rather than the rule.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Prospect</hi>. The future trend is likely to continue
                            to be gradual deterioration, with perhaps an occasional dramatic
                            large-scale Communist incident carried out for psychological purposes.
                            There is no immediate prospect of Communist conversion of their
                            guerrillas into conventional forces, but they may feel this will not be
                            necessary for their take-over of South Viet-Nam. They may instead decide
                            to depend upon war fatigue in South Viet-Nam and/or the U.S.</p>
                        <p>If the war drags on with gradual deterioration and no hope of victory,
                            the danger will arise of a switch in political sentiment among the South
                            Vietnamese educated class from strong anti-Communism to neutralism as
                            the only way to stop the war. From the U.S. standpoint I believe this
                            would be disastrous as neutralization of South Viet-Nam alone would
                            shortly lead to Communist take-over from North Viet-Nam.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Fundamental Factor</hi>. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> and his weaknesses represent the
                            basic underlying reason for the trend against us in the war. Under
                            present circumstances his excellent qualities of intelligence and
                            courage are outweighed by two great weaknesses: a) the organizational
                            inefficiency of his government resulting from his failure to take
                            decisions, refusal to delegate, lack of chain-of-command, refusal to
                            permit errors and distrust; and b) his inability to rally the masses to
                            his support because of his defects as a politician. To win against the
                            Communists, the Government of Viet-Nam should be either <hi rend="italic">efficient</hi> or <hi rend="italic">popular</hi>, but
                            the <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> Government is
                            neither.</p>
                        <p>There is common agreement on the essentiality of support of the
                            population if our side is to win the war. Since the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> does not now have this support, it
                            cannot get adequate intelligence from the people to rout the enemy, and
                            the enemy continues to be able to maintain its strength through
                            recruitment from the population.</p>
                        <p>To break this vicious circle, the government must win the support of the
                            villagers by providing adequate <hi rend="italic">protection</hi> and
                            helping them <hi rend="italic">improve their lot</hi>. This the
                            strategic hamlet program is designed in <pb n="598" xml:id="pg_598" facs="0618"/>theory to do, but the <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> Government's organizational inefficiency and poor
                            political approach give little promise that the program will be
                            effectively implemented by that government.</p>
                        <p>Despite frequent U.S. prodding over many months no real priorities for
                            the establishment of strategic hamlets have been set up, and no
                            systematic allocation of limited civilian and military resources has
                            been made in support of the program. Instead prominent officials are
                            pushing forth everywhere at once to complete the number which will
                            satisfy the pressures from Saigon, even though in almost all essential
                            respects many—probably the bulk—of these hamlets will be inadequate to
                            achieve their purposes and the people will often have been forced to
                            labor in vain.</p>
                        <p>The political approach used under <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>'s tutelage in
                            the strategic hamlets (establishment of mass organizations and reliance
                            on “self-help”, i.e., forced labor) is more likely to alienate than win

                            likely in Viet-Nam's atmosphere to be a sham. The economic and social

                        <p>It would be desirable to keep the U.S. hand in the coup concealed to the
                            maximum extent feasible. We would want to avoid any public connotation
                            that the new government was our puppet. However fear of exposure should
                            not deter our discreet involvement. We shall always be accused by some
                            of involvement (just as we were with respect to the November, 1960, coup
                            attempt and the February, 1962, palace bombing).<note n="3" xml:id="d268fn3">Regarding the February bombing of the palace, see

                        <p>The appropriate U.S. officials would quietly sound out a few carefully
                            selected Vietnamese (such as <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_DVMBM1">Minh</persName>) about a coup
                            possibility, and would if indicated make known its readiness to support
                            a coup at the proper time. With this encouragement these few Vietnamese
                            would contact other Vietnamese about participation. U.S. contacts would
                            be kept very limited to restrict knowledge of our role. We would advise
                            behind the scenes on organization, and let the Vietnamese do all of the
                            implementing.</p>
                        <p>The aim would be immediate seizure of all of the <persName>Ngo</persName>
                            brothers and Mme. <persName corresp="#p_TLX1">Nhu</persName> and their immediate removal
                            from Viet-Nam if they survived the process of seizure. The physical
                            process of seizure would probably be easier when <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> and the <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>s
                            are out of the palace traveling around the country. It would preferably
                            be carried out when brothers <persName corresp="#p_VQT1">Thuc</persName>
                            (the Archbishop) and Luyen (Ambassador to the U.K.) are out of the
                            country since they would be taken care of simply by preventing re-entry.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> (Secretary of State for
                            the Presidency) and Tuyen (head of the secret police) would be detained
                            to prevent counter-plotting, but could probably be released after the
                            coup was over since it is doubtful they would pose any real danger to a
                            new regime.</p>
                        <p>Since the armed forces represent the only real power force in Viet-Nam,
                            it would be necessary to line up in advance in support of the coup as
                            many of their key elements as feasible. Discretion would dictate caution
                            in too wide an approach, but since plans for seizure of the
                                <persName>Ngo</persName> family could miscarry at first, discretion
                            should be balanced against the possible need to use the armed forces
                            extensively and the desirability of denying the <persName>Ngo</persName>
                            family the possibility of rallying a significant segment of the armed
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. should be prepared to introduce combat military forces into
                            South Viet-Nam to prevent Communist seizure of provincial towns during
                            the crisis. If necessary to execute this step, the U.S. should publicly
                            announce its neutrality between the contending anti-Communist forces in
                            Viet-Nam. We should not be deterred from the step by the absence of a
                            request from the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Timing of a coup would be extremely important. Preferably the coup should
                            be carried out when there is publicly clear trend against the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in the war with the Communists since
                            many more Vietnamese would be psychologically prepared to support a coup
                            under these circumstances. It would be preferable also to keep the <pb n="601" xml:id="pg_601" facs="0621"/>interval between widespread
                            planning and execution short because of the danger of leaks. This does
                            not mean, however, that the U.S. might not discreetly work with selected
                            Vietnamese on the development of coup plans well in advance of
                            widespread contacts and execution.</p>
                        <p>American dependents should have been evacuated from Viet-Nam in advance
                            of execution of the coup plans. Otherwise we might well find them

                        <p>The specific measures in your program have therefore been proven to be
                            sufficiently comprehensive. The goals which were set remain essentially
                            unchanged, and constant surveillance is maintained in State and Defense
                            on the degree of achievement or accomplishments in each specific point
                            or area (see attached memorandum).</p>
                        <p>On the practical side, there has been concern as to just what these
                            measures have contributed toward winning the war, or at least toward
                            reversing the trend sufficiently in favor of Government forces to permit
                            victory in the foreseeable future. While the conditions described in the
                            recent <hi rend="italic">Newsweek</hi> article<note n="5" xml:id="d269fn5">Presumably a reference to <persName corresp="#p_SF3">Francois Sully</persName>'s article in the

                            are rejected by State and Defense, it is virtually impossible to elicit
                            specific replies from either of those Departments as to the degree of
                            success or failure, particularly in the military field. While confidence
                            in eventual victory is generally accepted, only General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> has said that “we are on
                            the winning side”. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCB1">Wood</persName> in
                            State assessed the situation by saying that the trend against the U.S.
                            in South Vietnam was halted last November, but presently we are just
                            about holding our own and an upward trend in our favor is not yet
                            clearly in sight.</p>
                        <p>Politically, <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> is, if anything,
                            weaker than he was when you met him, but the U.S. is determined to work
                            with him in the absence of a reasonable alternative. Economically,
                            progress is being made through the excellent cooperation of the
                            Vietnamese on the principles set down by the Staley Committee. Socially,
                            much progress has been made in health measures, agriculture credits and
                            improvements, education, and information. Great emphasis is being placed
                            on these social activities because of the recognition that the real
                            strength of Vietnam lies with the peasants and the Army and not with the
                            central Government. Certain achievements here, however, are going to be
                            more gradual. Militarily, such statistics as incidents, casualty rates,
                            desertions, loss and capture of weapons, frequency and size of attacks,
                            border infiltration, etc., do not reflect such a favorable picture. We
                            are now in a period where the impact of U.S. training, supplies,
                            assistance, doctrine and technique should soon be felt and yield
                            results.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> has held six
                            conferences in Hawaii with the Ambassadors and principal military people
                            from the area. While the voluminous transcripts of those conferences
                            reflect great attention to detail in providing for optimum success of
                            American effort, there is also a repetition of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s philosophy that the United
                            States must make an effective showing in Vietnam as quickly as possible
                            or be misunderstood by the American people, Congress and indeed by the
                            world. There is also motivation to avoid the charge of “too little, too
                            late”.</p>

                        <p>With the settlement in Laos, great attention has been paid to the
                            transfer of Viet Cong forces, but such an increase has not yet been
                            detected. However, the border crossing problem, as it has long existed,
                            remains practically unsolved. There have also been rumors that the
                            Communists would seek a Laos-type settlement in South Vietnam, but such
                            a settlement is currently ruled out because the South Vietnamese people
                            will not willingly accept the kind of settlement imposed in Laos. While
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> has pursued the
                            military effort with a great sense of urgency, he has, for planning
                            purposes, established a time factor to carry out the President's
                            decision last year to seek the settlement in Laos and to defend South
                            Vietnam. In addition to the elements of urgency described above, he has
                            also set forth the assumption that the present effort will be maintained
                            for three years. This is not to say that the effort will be terminated
                            or phased out in this period, but rather it is a realistic expression of
                            a reasonable period during which success must be achieved or at least be
                            in sight. Under present circumstances we appear to be just about turning
                            the corner.</p>

                            by a description of its present status:</p>
                        <p>1. Agreed to infuse into our actions high sense of urgency and
                            dedication.</p>
                        <p>Achieved on both sides, as evidenced by the American military build-up,
                            improved Vietnamese morale, exchanges of messages between President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> and President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>, and the momentum behind
                            the strategic hamlet program in Viet-Nam. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> last month that US-Vietnamese
                            cooperation was excellent. Both sides are agreed on the importance of
                            helping the peasants quickly by means of the strategic hamlet
                            program.</p>

                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> pleased US has approved
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> support for 20,000 force
                            increase but pointed to problem of paying local currency costs for this
                            increase.</p>
                        <p>The present regular armed forces level is now about 200,000, or 50,000
                            above the level in May 1961. The local currency problem has not been
                            completely solved. However, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> deficit
                            financing, higher yields on US-financed imports, increased tax
                            collections, combined with US assurances that we will provide resources
                            needed to stem possible inflation, have been sufficient to move ahead
                            with the buildup.</p>
                        <p>3. Agreed parallel political and economic action has equal importance
                            with military measures but stated political and economic actions must be
                            those appropriate to Viet-Nam as country which is underdeveloped and
                            subject Communist subversion.</p>
                        <p>There has been political and economic progress since May 1961, although
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s popular support has
                            probably declined. This is counterbalanced by momentum achieved m the
                            strategic hamlet program already underway, which shows great promise to
                            reverse the trend as villagers get security, more local self government,
                            economic benefits and a greater stake in the outcome of the war.</p>
                        <p>4. Agreed to increase in <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
                            personnel.</p>
                        <p>A steady increase of U.S. training, advisory and logistic support
                            personnel commenced in May 1961. The number has risen from 700 to
                            10,000, including those in operational units attached to the new
                            Military Assistance Command/Viet-Nam (MAC/V), of which <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> is now a component. <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> advisers in each province are doing a
                            terrific job.</p>
                        <p>5. Agreed to <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> support and advice to
                            Self-Defense Corps.</p>
                        <p>The training and rearming of <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> units is
                            proceeding rapidly and they are giving a good account of themselves.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> pleased with <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> support for entire Civil Guard force of
                            68,000.</p>
                        <p>Training has been speeded up with a target of training and rearming all
                                <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> units by the end of calendar 1962.
                            The strength target for FY 1964 is now 90,000.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> accepted offer of material
                            support for the Junk Force.</p>
                        <p>Construction is underway to develop a force of 28 Divisions (20 junks per
                            Division). Four divisions are now operational and performing their
                            mission to harass <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> seaborne
                            communications and stop infiltration from outside.</p>
                        <p>8. Noted that we are prepared to consider the case for further increase
                            in the strength of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> armed forces.</p>
                        <pb n="605" xml:id="pg_605" facs="0625"/>
                        <p>We have established a force goal of 225,000 (an increase of 50% from May
                            1961) to be achieved by June 1964.</p>
                        <p>9. Agreed to further urgent joint study of border control techniques.</p>
                        <p>Plans and concepts for border control are still under study by <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> and U.S. advisors. Intelligence on
                            infiltration is improving, especially as patrols of mountaineers are
                            being rapidly formed. US planes and helicopters and improved radio
                            communication now make it possible to bring Vietnamese troops quickly to
                            any threatened point.</p>
                        <p>10. Agreed to consider establishment in southeast Asia of research and
                            development facilities.</p>
                        <p>Combat test development centers have been established and are in
                            operation in Viet-Nam and Thailand. Research has led to many
                            improvements, e.g. better arms and armament for helicopters.</p>
                        <p>11. Agreed to use of US military specialists to assist Vietnamese armed
                            forces in health, welfare and public works activities at village level.
                            Stressed importance of tact of foreign officials in working in this
                            field.</p>
                        <p> US forces are working in all forty provinces to train the Vietnamese
                            Armed Forces in civic action and civil affairs, as well as mounting
                            their own civic action programs.</p>
                        <p>12. Agreed to renew border control negotiations with the Cambodian
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>In spite of repeated efforts by the US, joint Vietnamese-Cambodian
                            control has not been effected and incidents are frequent, causing
                            friction and helping the Viet Cong. Cambodia did, however, invite the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to send a military commission to
                            visit border areas and determine the extent of Viet Cong activity on the
                            Cambodian side. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has accepted and
                            will dispatch a team shortly. It might develop into a joint
                            operation.</p>
                        <p>13. Agreed on desirability of using foreign non-American experts in
                            counter-guerrilla field, but stressed it would be up to initiative
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to request these experts and
                            they would have to work under its control.</p>
                        <p>The British have sent a highly qualified advisory mission. Many of its
                            recommendations have been accepted. Australia has sent thirty trainers
                            to augment US <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> activities. Other
                            countries have sent survey missions or are being approached to provide
                            help.</p>
                        <p>14. Agreed to proposal for sending US economic and fiscal experts to work
                            out financial plan as basis for joint efforts.</p>

                            will, unless destroyed, nourish local Viet Cong. However, there is no
                            first-hand evidence to prove that this riceland is primarily for Viet
                            Cong use (Tab A<note n="3" xml:id="d270fn3">Telegram 129 from Saigon,
                                August 8; Department of State, Central Files, 751K.00/
                            8-862.</note>). Because of this operation there are resources in the
                            province to care for any Viet Cong or Montagnards who may flee the
                            area.</p>
                        <p>It is not feasible for ground troops to enter this area and destroy the
                            crops.</p>
                        <p>If the operation is to be carried out, it should, to be effective, be
                            done in August.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Disadvantages</p>
                        <p>(a) Although conducted by Vietnamese, there would be Communist propaganda
                            attacking the use of U.S. aircraft and techniques for the destruction of
                            Asian people's food.</p>
                        <p>(b) The way to win a guerrilla war, basically, is to win the people. Crop
                            destruction runs counter to this basic rule. The problem of identifying
                            fields on which the Viet Cong depend is hardly susceptible to solution
                            so long as the Viet Cong and the people are co-mingled. The Government
                            will gain the enmity of people whose crops are destroyed and whose wives
                            and children will either have to stay in place and suffer hunger or
                            become homeless refugees living on the uncertain bounty of a
                            not-too-efficient government.</p>
                        <p>Other people, who merely sympathize with them, will also hate the
                            government for crop destruction. The use of strange chemical agents, to
                            destroy crops, strikes at something basic implanted in human beings
                            (even if the people do not—as many will—fear that the chemical agents
                            are also directly harmful to people).</p>
                        <p>(c) Use of United States aerial spraying techniques to destroy crops in
                            Viet-Nam may give rise to Communist propaganda that the United States is
                            embarking on chemical warfare in Asia. This could give rise to increased
                            charges of use of poison gas and perhaps even of biological weapons
                            against Asian population.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Advantages and Other Considerations</p>
                        <p>(a) We have already carefully limited our supporting role in Viet-Nam. We
                            should not voluntarily deprive ourselves of the use of new techniques
                            unless we are sure the Vietnamese can subdue the Viet Cong without
                            them.</p>
                        <p>(b) The most effective way to hurt the Viet Cong is to deprive them of
                            food. Food is scarce in their mountain strongholds and food destruction
                            there can be most effective.</p>
                        <pb n="608" xml:id="pg_608" facs="0628"/>
                        <p>(c) Neither the method nor the concept are new. The British destroyed
                            some crops from the air in Malaya. In Viet-Nam, both sides are
                            destroying each other's food. The Vietnamese have been burning Viet Cong
                            crops with air-dropped napalm for some months. Napalm damages the soil
                            for several years; defoliants do not.</p>
                        <p>(d) The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is very anxious to undertake
                            this program and is looking into purchasing the chemicals in Hong Kong,
                            Taiwan or Tokyo. If the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> does this,
                            it will be more difficult for us to control and delimit the
                            operations.</p>
                        <p>(e) We have already absorbed some Communist propaganda accusing us of
                            destroying crops in connection with our earlier defoliant tests (Tab
                                B).<note n="4" xml:id="d270fn4">Telegram 145 from Saigon, August 15;
                                ibid., 751K.23/8-1562.</note> This propaganda did not arouse major
                            international repercussions. The Communists may continue these charges
                            even if we stop all defoliant and do not engage in crop destruction
                            operations. Communist charges of germ warfare in Korea were not
                            withdrawn consequent to the fact that, being untrue, they could not be
                            proven.</p>
                        <p>(f) With available techniques and chemicals the crops can be killed (Tab
                                C).<note n="5" xml:id="d270fn5">Tab C was a six-line extract from an
                                operational program on vegetation control.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>(g) Earlier limited defoliation experiments in Viet-Nam are reported to
                            have had the following effects:</p>
                        <p>a. Viet Cong leaders issued orders which showed concern (Tab D).<note n="6" xml:id="d270fn6">Tab D was a three-paragraph extract from a
                                review of the defoliation program in South Vietnam.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>b. According to <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName>,
                            defoliation appeared to the Montagnards as a powerful weapon, suggesting
                            that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is the more powerful side
                            which they should join; he has asserted it also made the Viet Cong put
                            more pressure on the Montagnards to ensure adequate food supplies, and
                            contributed to their leaving Viet Cong areas.</p>
                        <p>c. In neighboring Cambodia, <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Prince
                                Sihanouk</persName> did not show concern.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusions</p>
                        <p>Destroying crops will inevitably have political repercussions.
                            Intelligence is not yet reliable enough to assure that the crops
                            destroyed are those controlled solely by the Viet Cong. Some innocent,
                            or at least persuadable, peasants will be hurt and the Viet Cong will
                            make the most of this in their propaganda and recruiting.
                            Internationally, there will undoubtedly be greater reaction to a program
                            of crop destruction than there was to defoliation.</p>
                        <p>Since food in South Viet-Nam is plentiful, it is not likely that a
                            program for destroying crops would be effective enough to produce
                            starvation among the Viet Cong, but two realistic strategic goals do <pb n="609" xml:id="pg_609" facs="0629"/>seem possible. First, an
                            effective program might be able to cut down food supplies enough to
                            prevent the Viet Cong from stockpiling, thus making it difficult for
                            them to concentrate large forces and sustain them in combat. Second, an
                            effective program would force the Viet Cong to spend an increasing
                            proportion of their time on acquiring and transporting food, rather than
                            fighting.</p>
                        <p>It seems clear, however, that such results could be achieved only at a
                            later stage in the counter-guerrilla campaign, after the Viet Cong have
                            been isolated from the peasants and driven into well-defined areas of
                            concentration. To be effective, the program would have to be extensive,
                            and it is doubtful whether the government could carry out an extensive
                            program while the Viet Cong are as widely dispersed as they are at
                            present. An ineffective or premature program would only force the Viet
                            Cong to intensify their efforts to penetrate or destroy nearby strategic
                            hamlets, and the strategic hamlet program is in its present nascent
                            state still extremely vulnerable.</p>

                        <p>I recommend that we make the foregoing conclusions known to Ambassador

                            now embarking independently on a crop-destruction program which would be
                            at least premature.</p>
                        <p>I further recommend that the program under immediate consideration be

                        <p>[Here follows the beginning of the memorandum, which dealt with

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> said that the
                            JCS were being urged by General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>
                            Government to agree to a program of crop destruction in the north. If
                            this program is to be effective, it must be undertaken quickly before
                            the crops ripen and are harvested by the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> asked Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> how
                            State felt about the proposed program. Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>
                            said that State has not agreed to it and that State has received the
                            views of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and
                            the JCS which support the program. Accordingly, in view of the
                            importance of the matter and the differences in the positions taken by
                            State and Defense, Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> will have to decide the issue. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> then asked Mr.
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> to cover the basis for the State
                            position. Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> said that the State position
                            is contained in a memorandum to the White House which had been approved
                            the previous evening.<note n="2" xml:id="d271fn2">
                                <ref target="#d270">Document 270</ref>.</note> He noted that he had
                            given a copy of this memorandum to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RHS2">Rowen</persName> of <gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss> (<persName corresp="#p_RHS2">Rowen</persName> was present at this meeting). Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RHS2">Rowen</persName> then passed his copy of
                            the memorandum to General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName>. After reading the memorandum General
                                <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> remarked that the
                            matter will have to be decided at a higher level. However, he stated
                            that he personally disagreed with the State memorandum. He said that he
                            desired to proceed with the destruction of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> food stocks and this program was a good way to
                            accomplish the objective. Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> said it was
                            doubtful that we could destroy <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> crops
                            without destroying Montagnard crops at the same time. The crops are in
                            the same area and are not readily identifiable as belonging to one or
                            the other of the two groups. General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> said that this is not a problem because the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> have driven the Montagnards out of
                            the area and thus all crops will be harvested and consumed by the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> said
                            that the crops were not planted and raised by the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> but by the Montagnards. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RHS2">Rowen</persName> said that the <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>
                            program called for dose control and that the operation would be
                            conducted on a careful basis right down to the village level. Mr.
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> noted that the proposed program posed
                            great psychological problems even though the chemicals to be used were
                            obtainable at a hardware store. They were in fact similar to materials
                            we use on our own lawns. The proposed destruction using aircraft had
                            psychological drawbacks. General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> remarked that the program would have great
                            military advantages. Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> said that there is
                            no precedent for this type of action except in the case of British
                            employment of a similar program in Malaya. General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> said that it is strange that
                            we <pb n="611" xml:id="pg_611" facs="0631"/>can bomb, kill, and burn
                            people but are not permitted to starve them. Mr.
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> noted that food may be destroyed in
                            storage dumps.</p>

                            on Viet-Nam at some future time.</p>
                        <p>Our present objective in Viet-Nam is to help <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to achieve the strength necessary to exercise

                            help your people maintain their independence. If the Communist
                            authorities in north Viet-Nam will stop their campaign to destroy the
                            Republic of Viet-Nam, the measures we are taking to assist your defense

                            prepared to talk about situations which represent a threat to the peace,
                            but what must be talked about is the root of the trouble; in this case
                            it is the Communist aggression against Viet-Nam in disregard of the
                            Geneva Accords.”)</p>
                        <p>The following additional points could be made if necessary to meet a
                            Communist campaign for a conference. However, the decision on whether
                            and how to use them would depend on the circumstances since we will not
                            voluntarily enter a lengthy public discussion on Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>1. It has been suggested Lao settlement provides model for Viet-Nam.
                            International settlements, like forms of government, must be carefully
                            tailored to situation of a particular country or they cannot be
                            effective. The situations in Viet-Nam and Laos are certainly not the <pb n="612" xml:id="pg_612" facs="0632"/>same. While the U.S. was
                            willing to join in guaranteeing a policy of neutrality which was
                            generally desired in Laos, it will not seek to impose neutrality on a
                            nation which is fighting off aggression to keep its independence. The
                            source of this aggression has been indicated in the most recent report
                            of the International Control Commission for Viet-Nam.<note n="4" xml:id="d272fn4">See <ref target="#d208">Document 208</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. What can be gained by a conference on Viet-Nam now? Viet-Nam will not
                            and cannot negotiate its freedom. Neither a man nor a nation can be
                            asked to bargain for independence while facing an uplifted knife. Until
                            aggression against Viet-Nam stops, all international actions should be
                            designed to help this nation maintain its independence. Can other
                            nations make peace for Viet-Nam? The United States is helping Viet-Nam
                            fight for its freedom; we will not seek to persuade Viet-Nam to abandon
                            its freedom at conference table. This is a Vietnamese war; there can be
                            no lasting peace unless it is freely accepted by the Vietnamese.<note n="5" xml:id="d272fn5">In telegram 202, August 27, the Embassy in

                            tyrant. They seem believe Viet Cong can win in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> with support of North by disrupting country. They would
                            take over country but for our assistance. This much easier for <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> to see than is covert assistance given
                            other side. Yet new Viet Cong offensive may come after end of wet

                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> said we would like
                            broader based government which would gain more support among
                            intellectuals in Saigon; however we believe people in villages
                            responding favorably to provision arms by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and ready to fight in defense. We believe villagers
                            primary concern is security against Viet Cong. As to future we see
                            guerrilla war might extend for years unless North decides it has had
                            enough. Our objective is to help <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> get
                            Viet Cong out of their country. In view very unhappy situation there we
                            would welcome any constructive ideas which Indians can offer as
                            friends.</p>
                        <p>Amb replied he wished India could help; <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> had made approaches both sides without success. His
                            reason for coming in see <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>
                            was to warn us there may be <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> reports
                            which very displeasing to US. <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> answered we have left it to our Embassy in

                        <p>Dear Fritz: There has been increasing interest in Washington in recent
                            days in the political component of the effort against the guerrillas in
                            Viet Nam. I know that this is, of course, also very much on your mind
                            and I have been greatly encouraged to read the reports of the progress
                            you have been making in this area as well as in other areas. We have
                            also been encouraged by recent talks with Rufus Phillips about his
                            explorations and activities relating to this problem.<note n="2" xml:id="d275fn2">In June 1962, Rufus Phillips had gone to Vietnam as

                            would agree that we ought to canvass all possible avenues for improving

                        <p>While I have no illusions about the possibilities for ending the war
                            quickly, I do have the personal feeling, based upon the indicators I
                            have seen, that we may in the next few months be approaching the real
                            turning point of the struggle. If this is true, it becomes particularly
                            important that we explore every possible measure that makes any sense
                            and that might help get us over the hump. Guerrilla wars—like battles
                            for air supremacy—tend to come to a peak and spiral in one direction or
                            another. I do not feel that this one is likely to spiral against us in
                            the next six months; but it could—as seen from a great distance—spiral
                            for us if the hamlet program, and all it stands for, takes hold. It is
                            for that reason that those cheering your team on from Washington, may
                            appear to be straining under circumstances which otherwise represent a
                            very great accomplishment over the past nine months or so.</p>
                        <p> Bob Johnson, a member of the Policy Planning Council, several weeks ago
                            completed the attached study<note n="3" xml:id="d275fn3">See <ref target="#d249fn3">Document 249 and footnote 3</ref>

                            with the countryside. I believe that you were given an earlier draft of
                            the paper at the time of the last Honolulu meeting.<note n="4" xml:id="d275fn4">Presumably the July 17 draft referred to in <ref target="#d249fn3">footnote 3, Document 249</ref>.</note>
                            Necessarily our information on the subjects covered was somewhat
                            incomplete at the time the paper was prepared and there have been
                            further developments since that time. In particular the description of
                            US programs in Section VI is out of date.</p>

                        <p>We realize that at this distance from Viet Nam we cannot possibly have
                            the feel for the situation that you and your colleagues in Saigon have
                            acquired. I am sending you the paper solely with the thought that the
                            analysis and the suggestions in it may be of use to you as a further
                            source of ideas in your daily work on these problems. I am also
                            enclosing with this letter a list of additional suggestions which we
                            obtained when we sought reactions here to the paper. This list, too, may
                            contain ideas that you can use.</p>
                        <p>If the paper were to be revised today we would need to take account of
                            the following major points bearing upon the recommendations contained in
                            it which have emerged from informal review of the paper in
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>1. We get conflicting information here as to which are the weakest links
                            in the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s administrative
                            relationships with the countryside where improvement in training and use
                            of new training techniques may be most needed. Possibly we have not
                            identified the highest priority targets. It is our understanding that
                            there is much more information in Saigon on the status of training
                            programs than is available here. (A recent airgram (Toaid A-513),<note n="5" xml:id="d275fn5">Not found.</note> for example, contains
                            information on provincial training centers which was not previously
                            available in Washington.) We believe that our suggestions on the
                            character, general priority and organization of training programs have
                            merit, however.</p>
                        <p>2. The recommendation that appointive councils be continued at the
                            village and hamlet level and that elective advisory councils be created
                            and given major functions (Recommendation 6) was based upon two
                            assumptions. One was that, under present circumstances, it would be very
                            difficult to get genuinely free elections of hamlet officials who would
                            be bearing the main burden of administering the government programs at
                            the hamlet level. We assumed—and some of the available <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> instructions on the program seemed to
                            support this assumption—that province and district officials would
                            assure that their candidates would be elected. We also had some doubts,
                            based also in part upon <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            instructions, as to whether the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            intended to give these elected hamlet councils real authority over
                            constructive programs that would have genuine popular appeal instead of
                            limiting them solely to control of the rural population and to the
                            imposition of onerous-seeming burdens on the population. We are still
                            not certain whether these assumptions are incorrect but some reports
                            seem to suggest that really free elections are being permitted and that
                            there might be plans for giving continuing constructive tasks to the
                            hamlet councils. It is obviously important that this should be the
                            case.</p>
                        <pb n="618" xml:id="pg_618" facs="0638"/>
                        <p>3. It is our understanding that you are now using the provincial military
                            advisers as temporary provincial <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
                            advisers as the paper suggested (Recommendation 8) independently of any
                            knowledge that such a proposal was under consideration. It is, of
                            course, obvious that this must be a stop-gap measure until we have the
                            people and have made the arrangements with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> for <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> personnel to
                            handle such jobs. It seems important that installation of <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> advisers at provincial levels proceed
                            with some speed.</p>
                        <p>4. We have been greatly encouraged by recent progress with respect to the
                            Montagnards (Recommendation 11). As we understand it the government has
                            just embarked, with our help and support, on a country-wide Montagnard
                            program directed not only toward immediate urgent relief requirements
                            for those that have come out of the hills, but also toward longer-range
                            welfare and economic needs. I have also been delighted to hear of the
                            progress that is being achieved in making the Montagnards into a
                            significant military factor and of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s apparent enthusiasm for this program.</p>
                        <p>I hope that Bill Trueheart may get back to Washington in the near future
                            and that I can get together with him to discuss political aspects of
                            counterinsurgency in Viet Nam. I know that his activities as chairman of
                            the Committee on Province Rehabilitation have brought him into intimate
                            daily contact with the problems involved. As a purely personal thought I
                            have been wondering recently whether there might not be real utility in
                            devoting some significant portion of one of the Honolulu meetings to the
                            political component of our effort in Viet Nam. Obviously such a
                            discussion should be carefully prepared in advance and it would also be
                            necessary to include some additional top-level people from Washington
                            and Saigon. I might informally discuss such a possibility with Bill if
                            he comes to Washington.</p>
                        <p>In closing I want to say again that we are most impressed with the job
                            you are doing and with the momentum that is, as a result, beginning to
                            develop in Viet Nam.</p>
                        <p>With warmest greetings to you both and the children. Practice your
                            ping-pony for my next visit.<note n="6" xml:id="d275fn6">Attached to the

                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Scholarships as Rewards</hi>. The Government ought
                            to be encouraged to search for additional means of satisfying the
                            desires of rural youth for increased status and upward mobility which
                            they may otherwise seek to satisfy through participation in Viet Cong
                            activities. For example, education is the key to vertical mobility for
                            many Vietnamese and consideration might be given to providing
                            scholarships to young Vietnamese as a reward for active participation in
                            hamlet defense units, heroism under fire, etc. Perhaps these youth
                            should be selected by popular secret ballot or by hamlet councils (where
                            they are elected by truly free electoral process). Their training might
                            be in subjects useful to them personally (e.g., higher education that
                            would qualify them for Government service) or to the hamlet itself
                            (e.g., education in health or mechanics).</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Land Reform</hi>. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> now holds 260,000 hectares of land acquired from former
                            French landlords and about 125,000 hectares from Vietnamese landlords
                            which is still undistributed. This land might, wherever possible, be
                            distributed free to young people who distinguish themselves in building
                            or defending strategic hamlets. This again would help satisfy the desire
                            for vertical mobility on the part of such young people. It might also be
                            possible to distribute some of this land to the strategic hamlets
                            themselves as common land, the income of which would be used for the
                            support of hamlet officials or local facilities such as hamlet schools.
                            Finally, some of this land might be distributed to families of Viet Cong
                            victims. If such actions were exploited effectively by information media
                            (along with an exposition of Communist land policy in North Vietnam)
                            they might help nullify the appeal that Communist land reform seems to
                            have for the peasant in Vietnam. Finally, we ought to encourage the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, as part of the strategic hamlet
                            program, to make it the responsibility of elected hamlet officials to
                            enforce provisions of the land reform act.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">National Strategic Hamlet Congress</hi>. We might
                            encourage the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to hold a national
                            strategic hamlet congress in Saigon in the near future with elected
                            representatives from each strategic hamlet. Such a congress could study
                            the program, compare notes on experiences and advise the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. An important part of such a Congress
                            might be the honoring of bona fide strategic hamlet heroes. Perhaps the
                            distribution of land and/or scholarships to some of these people by
                            President <pb n="620" xml:id="pg_620" facs="0640"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> could be the principal event
                            of the congress. Such a congress would help foster a sense of national
                            identity, giving the rural population some feeling of participation in
                            the national government, and could provide some useful ideas on the
                            organization and administration of the program. Information media could
                            play all of this back to the countryside.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Employment of National Assembly Deputies in the
                                Strategic Hamlet Program.</hi> National Assembly deputies are, for
                            the most part, loyal, intelligent and talented people and in many cases
                            their abilities are badly under-employed. We might consider suggesting
                            that some of them could play an active hamlet-level role in the
                            strategic hamlet program. At a minimum, they might be attached to
                            appropriate regional strategic hamlet committees as special advisers and
                            inspectors.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Provincial Administration</hi>. Some reports suggest
                            that one of the weak links in the administrative chain is at the level
                            of the provincial bureaucracy. We should encourage the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to continue to prune the provincial
                            bureaucracy of corrupt or abusive officials and to improve training
                            programs, perhaps along the lines suggested in the paper.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Reunification.</hi> The government might gain some
                            increased popular support by a carefully-designed and well-publicized

                        <p>Dear Mr. Secretary: In the attachment to your August 27 memorandum to Mr.
                                <persName>Johnson</persName>
                            <note n="2" xml:id="d276fn2">The attachment to the August 27 memorandum
                                of transmittal is a one-page memorandum from Gilpatric to the
                                Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also dated August 27, along
                                the lines summarized here. (Department of State, Central Files,
                                951K.8158/8-2762)</note> (who is on leave), you outlined the
                            assumptions on which the Secretary of Defense had based a recommendation
                            to the President<note n="3" xml:id="d276fn3">See <ref target="#d262">Document 262</ref>.</note> that he approve a trial program of
                            chemical crop destruction in Viet Cong territory in Phu Yen Province.
                            One of the two assumptions was that the Montagnards had abandoned the
                            target area <pb n="621" xml:id="pg_621" facs="0641"/>in recent months.
                            Actually, our Embassy at Saigon has reported that very few refugees had
                            come out of the mountains of Phu Yen, that most of those requesting
                            assistance were ethnic Vietnamese, and that indications were lacking
                            that they were from the proposed target area (Saigon's telegram 129,
                            August 8<note n="4" xml:id="d276fn4">Not printed. (<persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> Library, National Security

                            a basic assumption underlying the DOD recommendation, you may wish to
                            reconsider it.</p>
                        <p>We nevertheless posed to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> the two numbered questions you listed, as well
                            as the additional question as to whether the time is not passed when the
                            operation could be successfully carried out against this year's rice
                            harvest (Deptel to Saigon 212, August 27<note n="5" xml:id="d276fn5">The
                                two questions were: 1) would the rice land benefit primarily the
                                Viet Cong? and 2) would the denial of food seriously upset their
                                operations? (Department of State, Central Files,
                                751K.00/8-862)</note>). He has replied that it has indeed already
                            passed (Saigon's 233, September 1<note n="6" xml:id="d276fn6">Telegram
                                233 reported that the crop target areas were controlled by the Viet
                                Cong, but that any crop destruction in Vietnam would cause temporary
                                hardship to the population. (Ibid., 751K.00/9-162)</note>). In
                            replying to your numbered questions, he indicated: (1) that the crops in
                            question would importantly benefit the Viet Cong, but will still help
                            support the Montagnards in the area, as the Viet Cong rarely confiscate
                            the entire crop of any one plot; and (2) it is assumed that loss of its
                            share of the crop would hurt the Viet Cong, but that not enough is known
                            in detail about the Viet Cong's planned operations to say that this
                            proposed crop destruction would have seriously set them back.</p>
                        <p>You will note, from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>'s reply, that he would like us now to consider
                            authorizing the working out of an alternate target area, and that the
                            question of authorizing release of chemicals for use in ground
                            operations, in place of more laborious methods of crop destruction, has
                            been raised.</p>
                        <p>It is our view that it would be inappropriate to approve Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>'s proposals, at
                            least at this stage when Viet Cong and the general populace are closely
                            intermingled. We propose to prepare and seek DOD concurrence for a reply
                            in that sense.</p>

                            welcome to his guests, General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> expressed to the President his pleasure with the
                            splendid results of ARVNAF aggressiveness during the preceding
                            month—especially in the III Corps area. He attributed these successes to
                            the excellent cooperation of the various fighting arms: the Army, the
                            Air Force, the supporting helicopter units and the River Forces. He said
                            that, not only was he personally delighted, but that he was sure that
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> would be
                            pleased with the progress which has been made since his visit to Vietnam

                            throes of the flood disaster. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWC2">Trueheart</persName> said that he had personal experience of the
                            remarkable progress that had been made, since he had arrived in Vietnam
                            at about the time of General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>'s visit. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> added that this progress was not restricted to
                            the III Corps area but was evident throughout the country. He then told
                            the President that the purpose of his visit was to present to him the
                            concept of a plan which he thought that the President would like. He
                            said that, the fact that so much progress had been made was the best of
                            all arguments that no stop should occur now. In two or three months,
                            said the General, would come the fruition of most of the efforts which
                            have been made up to now. If all resources were used to the fullest,
                            there could be no reason why one could not push on to victory. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> then started to
                            enumerate for the President the assets which were held by Vietnam.
                            First, he said, the intelligence net which has been in place since May
                            was now producing good results. Even the people were volunteering
                            information—a good, healthy sign. Next, continued General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>, the communications <pb n="623" xml:id="pg_623" facs="0643"/>system within the country was
                            improving rapidly. The Tropo-scatter system was installed and beginning
                            to work well. On the preceding Tuesday, he said, he had held a
                            conference call with the Senior Advisors of Da Nang, Pleiku and Saigon
                            and reception had been excellent. In reply to President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s question as to whether the
                            system provided communications security, General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> explained that, as in all
                            other systems where transmission was in the clear, there was danger of
                            compromise. He added that there would soon be incorporated a teletype
                            system which would provide security. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> then went on to list, as
                            the next asset, the great increase in mobility of the armed forces. He
                            said that, in addition to all that had already been accomplished there
                            would soon be two more helicopter companies arriving in Vietnam. October
                            would see the beginning of the arrival of one hundred and twelve more
                            M-113 armored personnel carriers. In November, the first of 95 M-114
                            armored vehicles would arrive. He explained to the President that the
                            M-114 is a new armored reconnaissance vehicle which carries four men,
                            reputed to be very good, and so new that it had not yet been used by the
                            armed forces of the United States. The General pointed out to the
                            President that the assignment of this new equipment to Vietnam was
                            evidence of the great interest placed by the United States in the
                            struggle which was going on here. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> then went on to list as
                            additional assets the 15 armed HU1A helicopters which were to arrive in
                            the very near future. Added to these, he said, would be a half dozen new
                            armed Mohawk aircraft, which he described as well equipped with
                            communications equipment, capable of carrying out reconnaissance
                            missions, of taking aerial photographs, and of providing armed escort
                            and fire support. In answer to a query from the President he explained
                            that they could operate from small airstrips. Next in the recapitulation
                            of assets, said the General, was the fact that the 9th Division had
                            completed training and the 25th Division would complete its formation in
                            January. By December, he added, the Civil Guard would have been trained,
                            as well as most of the Self Defense Corps. Added to all this, he went
                            on, there would be sixteen more Special Forces Training teams (four of
                            which had arrived), consisting of two officers and ten men per team.
                            Already, thirteen Montagnard Scout companies had been trained. As
                            additional assets, the various youth groups of the country had been
                            trained by the thousands and an untold number of women had undergone
                            some sort of indoctrination in the use of weapons. With a smile, the
                            President said that, on a recent visit to an Agricultural Development
                            Center he had noticed that all the guards in the area were women. It had
                            been explained to him that the men were away to attend a course of
                            instruction on Strategic Hamlets—but he added—the women obviously took
                            their guard duties seriously. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> commented that he had seen in the newspapers
                            that some 3,000 <pb n="624" xml:id="pg_624" facs="0644"/>more women were
                            about to undergo paramilitary training. The President confirmed this and
                            added that among the women were three Doctors of Medicine and a number
                            of other professional women—all volunteers. Then to complete his
                            summation of the assets on the side of the government, General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> mentioned the Catholic
                            Youth Groups operating under the guidance of Father Hoa and Father Bosco
                            and the large number of people enrolled in the Forces Populaires. To
                            this must be added, he said, the Ranger Companies, the four Special
                            Ranger Battalions and the Marine Battalions. The Air Force, he went on,
                            had greatly increased the number of sorties and, by the end of the year,
                            the Vietnamese Navy would have markedly increased strength and would be
                            appreciably more active, with greater capability in coastal and river
                            operations. In all, concluded General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>, there would be some 450,000 people under arms,
                            not counting the youth and the women. With all this in a concentrated,
                            integrated effort it should be possible to do something within the
                            country. Perhaps it would not be possible to kill all the Viet Cong—but
                            it should at least drive them underground. Even this would not be bad,
                            because it would permit the continuation of the construction of
                            Strategic Hamlets and the economic development of the country. If,
                            eventually, the Viet Cong should try to come out in the open again the
                            forces would be there to push their heads down again.</p>
                        <p>Saying that this, then, was the aim—General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> showed President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> a notebook containing the
                            principal elements of the concept according to which an operational plan
                            could be built.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> then explained
                            to the President what the purpose of the plan should be. He showed that
                            implementation should be in successive phases—the formulation of the
                            plan, preparation, the explosion and then the follow-up. Before
                            continuing his explanation he showed the President a chart<note n="3" xml:id="d277fn3">Not found.</note> which indicated the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> strength in each province of Vietnam. On
                            examination of the figures the President protested that those indicated
                            for the I Corps and II Corps regions were too low and said that his
                            national intelligence people had much higher holdings in those areas,
                            particularly in Quang Nam, Quang Ngai and in the mountains and high
                            plateau areas extending from these provinces down to Kontum. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> pointed out that,
                            according to the compilation of all intelligence from Vietnamese as well
                            as American sources there was a total of slightly over 20,000 hard core
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> in the entire country. Added to
                            these there could be another 100,000 local guerrillas and an unknown
                            number of sympathizers. The guerrilla companies were composed of a
                            handful of cadres and expanded to 50 or 100 men, many or most of whom
                            were impressed local people. The comparison of strength, the General
                            indicated, was <pb n="625" xml:id="pg_625" facs="0645"/>very favorable
                            to the government. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> then told the President that, since his idea was
                            still only the concept of a plan, a great deal of detailed planning
                            remained to be accomplished. He had spoken of this only to Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>, he explained, since he
                            had not yet received the President's approval to discuss it with others.
                            Detailed study, he continued, could very easily indicate the need for
                            some redeployment of forces so that the sudden explosion everywhere at
                            the same time would be most effective. He cited as examples the
                            provinces of Ba Xuyen and Tay Ninh. Even with actions such as these it
                            might not be possible to accomplish all at once because of such
                            considerations as the varying weather conditions in different areas of
                            the country at any given time. Of prime importance in the development of
                            a workable plan to implement his concept, said General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>, was the establishment of a
                            single chain of command, starting with the President as
                            Commander-in-Chief, descending through the Assistant for National
                            Defense through the Joint General Staff down to the lowest operational
                            levels. Only thus could directives be gotten to all areas to ensure that
                            all troops and supplies would be used most effectively. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> next showed the
                            President a chart<note n="4" xml:id="d277fn4">Not found.</note> which
                            indicated the areas of Vietnam which could be supported by helicopters
                            after the arrival of the new companies. He added that <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> had spoken of the assignment of
                            an airplane carrier from which a battalion of Marines, paratroopers or
                            regular <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> troops could be
                            transported by helicopter to any area along the coast. The General then
                            said that joint command centers and combined operations centers would
                            have to be established at different echelons and explained briefly why
                            they would be needed. He said that the detailed plan would be Vietnamese
                            and that the role of the United States would continue to be to assist
                            and to recommend. Decisions, he emphasized, would be for the President
                            to make. Overall command, he went on, would have to be at governmental
                            and <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss> level since elements other than
                            the military would be included in the all-out effort. Operations would
                            be conducted through the command centers to provide for all
                            eventualities, such as the possible requirement for redeployment of,
                            say, five Ranger companies which normally would be kept under Province
                            Chief control. There could also be a need for increased logistical
                            support, entailing the need to prestock essential supplies such as
                            ammunition, equipment and food. There would certainly be a need for
                            intensified, accelerated training—much of it on a geographical basis—by
                            troops such as marines, rangers and special forces designated to operate
                            in specific areas. It would be necessary to work hard, and at night, and
                            the work would have to be continued until all preparations were
                            completed. Contact would have to be made and maintained with <pb n="626" xml:id="pg_626" facs="0646"/>the enemy. Communications would need to
                            be established on a continuous basis throughout the system from the top
                            down to battalion, company and platoon level. Of great importance would
                            be the participation of civic action teams to provide all essential
                            services, such as police, administration, medical. In preparation for an
                            all-out operation—from now on—all possible means of identifying and
                            fixing the enemy should be employed. Complementary to this, should be a
                            good psychological warfare program which would include both the military
                            and the civilian segments of the population. Maximum surveillance of
                            routes to control infiltration across borders and to locate enemy
                            installations would have to be set up. People, such as the Special
                            Battalions, the Montagnard Scout Companies, Special Forces, as well as
                            regulars would have to be put into the field to find the enemy. Whenever
                            possible, where government forces were in sufficient strength the enemy
                            should be killed at once. If conditions would not permit this, they
                            should be marked for later destruction. Wherever appropriate targets
                            could be pinpointed, immediate bombing operations should be carried out
                            against them. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>, at this point, assured the President that, when
                            warranted, massive bombing operations such as those which the President
                            had requested for the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> infested
                            foothills of Quang Nam and Quang Ngai could be carried out. Above all,
                            the General stressed, preparations would have to begin as soon as
                            possible. One of the first steps should be to bring existing units up to
                            strength. There might be need to call up reserves or to increase
                            conscription. Of prime importance was the adequate staffing of the many
                            units which now had only 50 or 60% of their officer and non-commissioned
                            officer strength. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> then said that nothing that he had suggested in
                            the presentation of his concept should be construed to mean that what
                            was now being done should be discontinued. On the contrary, what he
                            proposed would amount to nothing more than an expansion, an
                            acceleration. He considered the Strategic Hamlet program, he said, to be
                            one of the highlights of any plan for total victory and added that a
                            pipeline had been set up to guarantee the orderly, timely flow of
                            materials for this program. After once more stressing the great
                            importance of obtaining all possible intelligence from all possible
                            sources—including the military, the use of agents, the exploitation of
                            civilians and the means available to province and district chiefs,
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> suggested to
                            the President that, in each Corps, there should be a special “Quick
                            Reaction Strike Force.” This force, which would consist of a battalion
                            of Airborne or Regular <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> troops, or
                            perhaps Rangers, would be provided with a half-dozen helicopters and a
                            number of C-47 or C-123 aircraft. They would be on constant alert and
                            able to intervene rapidly wherever needed. They would, in a sense,
                            constitute the Corps reserve force. In summary, said General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>, the concept which he had
                            presented could be the <pb n="627" xml:id="pg_627" facs="0647"/>basis
                            for a bold plan to destroy the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> with
                            one massive, integrated all-out effort. The Supreme Commander of the
                            operation would be the President himself with command going directly
                            from him in a single chain down to the lowest level.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> then
                            reemphasized the fact that, if the Viet Cong should go underground, the
                            government could continue its strategic hamlet program and to work
                            toward the economic growth of the country. It could afford to wait and,
                            if the enemy should attempt to rise again, the necessary force would be
                            available to crush them once more. With good intelligence, he said, they
                            would not be able to come back. He then stressed the fact that what he
                            had presented to the President was a concept only. There was no
                            elaborate plan as yet—no details worked out. What was needed first of
                            all was the desire to accomplish the destruction of the Viet Cong—and
                            the will to do it. He was sure, he said, that the Vietnamese people
                            wanted to do it.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> then asked General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> what he thought
                            the time required to do this would be—and what results could be
                            expected. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>
                            said that he thought the plan should be prepared for implementation
                            shortly after the first of the year. He reiterated once more that the
                            result might be to drive the Communists underground, but—he underlined,
                            this would be O.K.—since it would permit freedom of action to the
                            government in its plans for defense in the strategic action program, and
                            for offense through the economic growth of the country. He said that he
                            was perhaps optimistic—but that he always was. He felt that one year
                            would be enough to achieve victory. Secretary McNamara had not agreed
                            with him and it was somewhat difficult to find others who would—but he
                            could not see, he insisted, why with all the assets that he had
                            listed—amounting to more than 450,000 people, success could not be
                            achieved. He was convinced that it could be. He then cautioned the
                            President that some of his leaders, even the military, might not
                            approve—in which event he suggested, others must be found that would.
                            The plan, General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>
                            continued, would require a considerable amount of training—including
                            schools for senior officers to give them the entire background, to
                            familiarize them with the plan itself and to instill in them the will to
                            accomplish it. The General then showed the President a number of pages
                            in his notebook which listed the proposed training courses at various
                            levels.</p>
                        <p>The President (obviously intrigued), then said that he thought the plan,
                            in principle, to be very good. He added that it must be examined in the
                            light of all forces presently available—and he added, the political
                            aspect must be considered. As a first impression, he said that one had
                            better look to three years instead of one. To reduce the Viet Cong like
                            this—he mused—would be better to think in terms of three years. The
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, he thought, would not accept a
                            defeat of this kind. In answer <pb n="628" xml:id="pg_628" facs="0648"/>to General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>' remark
                            that they were going to have to accept it, the President protested that
                            the viewpoint of the enemy was unknown—no one knew what the reaction
                            would be. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>
                            then said that his philosophy in war was not to worry about the enemy
                            but, rather, to let the enemy worry about him. The President agreed that
                            this was good, in principle, but added that, since we did not know what
                            to expect we should consider the situation not only in the light of what
                            both sides now have, but also from the viewpoint of what the enemy can
                            do. Since the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> cannot accept a crushing
                            defeat it should be expected that they would reinforce. For example, in
                            the field of logistics they could start using air supply. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> replied that they
                            couldn't, we would destroy them. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> then said that, in the mountains of Quang Ngai the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are reported to have anti-aircraft
                            sites prepared. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> reminded him that we have radar and intercept
                            aircraft which fly every night. These planes operate from Tan Son Nhut
                            and fly out to meet every aircraft that is not properly identified. Any
                            effort on the part of the communists to use air supply would be crushed.
                            Also, continued the General, if the Viet Cong bring in more forces there
                            will be more of them for us to defeat. He reminded the President that
                            during the past two months 2,500 <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            regular and paramilitary personnel had been neutralized. Three battalion
                            headquarters had been destroyed in the III Corps area and another had
                            been hit in the I Corps area. If, for the next five months, all efforts
                            could be concentrated on the gathering of intelligence-military units,
                            penetration agents, civilians and all the rest, the enemy could be
                            pinpointed and hit everywhere at once. If all could not be killed—they
                            would at least have to go into hiding and government operations could
                            continue unhindered—with the populace convinced that the average <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> is not twelve feet high. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> then suggested
                            that a system of rewards be instituted to stimulate reporting of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> identities in the villages. If the morale
                            of the people were lifted to the point where all desired the elimination
                            of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> there would be no reason why
                            this plan should miss. As an example of the already raised morale of the
                            people the General cited the example of the latest volunteer class of
                            officer candidates at Thu Duc, for which four hundred more applied than
                            could be accepted. The President agreed that this had been a very good
                            sign and added that, during the war, a similar appeal for volunteers had
                            met with no response.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> next pointed out to
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> that the
                            timing of his proposed plan coincided with the target date for the
                            completion of i/2 of the Strategic Hamlet plan. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> agreed that this was so and
                            mentioned the fact that machinery had been set up to provide much of the
                            needed materials for the execution of this plan—on a recurring three
                            months basis. He added that he did not feel that all hamlets had to be
                            provided with the same physical security. <pb n="629" xml:id="pg_629" facs="0649"/>The President agreed and said that the philosophy
                            behind the entire plan was to set up and teach basic democracy as a
                            countermeasure against the teachings of the North and against those who
                            were pressing for neutrality. He said that, with the means which were
                            now available to the government, the enemy had been disturbed and that
                            this was why they had recently started to cry for international
                            conferences on neutrality. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> commented that they would cry louder if—based on
                            the concept which he had presented—a resultant plan were to be
                            implemented and carried out. The President once more expressed his doubt
                            that the communists would accept defeat in this way and referred vaguely
                            to political maneuvers which they might adopt. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWC2">Trueheart</persName> commented that these
                            maneuvers would not bother him. The President then, stating that his
                            remarks were made in confidence, said that there had been recent
                            evidence of subversive activities—such as the extension of their
                            espionage net—by the French. This he interpreted as evidence that they
                            were attempting to pursue the same policy in Vietnam that they had
                            followed in Laos. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWC2">Trueheart</persName>
                            assured him that the United States policy in Vietnam was not at all the
                            same as that which had been followed in Laos. The President then said
                            that he was not happy with the position which the United States had
                            adopted with respect to Laos. He felt that the United States could have
                            stated that they favored a government of “National Union” and that there
                            could be no question of helping one part of a coalition. Further, he
                            said, there should have been a statement that the United States was not
                            in agreement with “Neutralism”. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWC2">Trueheart</persName> said that, in Vietnam there was no question of
                            “Neutralism” and that the policy of his government was one of total war
                            aimed at the destruction of the Viet Cong. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> added that he wanted to
                            destroy the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> in order that the people
                            of Vietnam might enjoy their country and see its beauty as he
                            had—mentioning the wonderful attractions of Cap St. Jacques, Dalat and
                            Nha Trang. He deplored the fact that the people of Saigon could travel
                            no farther than Tan Son Nhut—where they gathered in crowds each Sunday.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> replied somewhat
                            wryly that General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>
                            was indulging in flights of imagination. He said that, not long before,
                            he had attended a graduation ceremony at Thu Duc. He had heard that
                            American advisors had planned to travel to the site by helicopter
                            because they considered road travel to be too dangerous. They had
                            changed their minds when they learned that the President was travelling
                            by road. He added that his British advisors, in their report on the
                            Strategic Hamlet program, had explained that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, since they could no longer safely attack the villages,
                            had concentrated their attacks on the more vulnerable roads and the
                            railroad. He added that, in the same report, it had been pointed out
                            that, the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, facing the loss of part of
                            their control over the countryside, had begun a program aimed at
                            exciting students <pb n="630" xml:id="pg_630" facs="0650"/>as a first
                            step in their activities on a political plane in Saigon. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> commented that if
                            the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> were attacked and killed they
                            could not do this. He pointed out that there were now some 500 incidents
                            per week—in which an average of 700 <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            were killed and 100 Vietnamese soldiers and civilians lost their lives.
                            If the plan were implemented the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> would
                            be destroyed and all this would end. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWC2">Trueheart</persName> explained that, on the one hand, the civilian
                            strength of the country should be mobilized to support the plan. The
                            Strategic Hamlets would constitute part of this mobilization. What
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> proposed, he
                            added, was the simultaneous total mobilization of the armed forces.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> commented
                            that he felt that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> were now off
                            balance. They were losing much of their force and it would be very
                            difficult for them to bring in more either by land or by sea. With the
                            Montagnards—the Rhade, the Bahnar, the people around Aschan and Aloui—on
                            our side, large scale infiltration of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            was becoming increasingly difficult. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> pointed out that one of the most
                            critical areas was still the Annamite chain in the Center, particularly
                            the province of Quang Nam and Quang Ngai. Their plan was still to push
                            from the foothills down to the coast in order to obtain the supplies
                            which they needed badly. Recent helicopter operations in this area had
                            helped considerably because it had caused the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> to hesitate in carrying out their plan. As long as they
                            stayed in this redoubt they were safe and even had caves and tunnels in
                            which they could hide. Because of the helicopter operations they were
                            beginning to fear that if they left their bases the areas would be
                            seized and they would not be able to return. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> commented that the answer
                            was to go in and get them in their tunnels. He then told the President a
                            story which he had heard on two occasions, once in Bac Lieu and once in
                            Saigon. An <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> Commander had taken up
                            a position with his battalion along the banks of a river. Someone
                            pointed out to him that the area on the other side of the stream
                            appeared to be a better bivouac and asked him why he did not go there.
                            His answer was that the area was occupied by the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. When he was asked why he did not go after them he
                            replied, “as long as we don't bother them, they won't bother us.” The
                            President said that this commander was a lazy man and admitted that
                            there were areas where his commanders hesitated to attack. Normally the
                            Viet Cong do not attack government forces where they have infiltration
                            routes or in the areas where their headquarters are located. In these
                            areas very little activity occurs. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> protested that this was not
                            right and was certainly no way to win. The President said that he had
                            spoken strongly to General <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Don</persName>,
                            telling him that there could be no war without men being killed or
                            wounded. Reports from I Corps had shown few if any <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> casualties. Also, said the President,
                            he could not see a commander preserve his forces while Civil Guard and
                            Self Defense <pb n="631" xml:id="pg_631" facs="0651"/>Corps members were
                            being killed. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>
                            commented that if commanders did not want to fight they should come to
                            the President and tell him so, and the President could find others who
                            would. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> agreed with
                            the General and spoke of events which had taken place in Kien Hoa
                            Province. There the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> had assembled
                            their “brains” for three years and there were no reports of activities.
                            The President had warned the Province Chief that he was due for a rude
                            awakening and that he was in fact cooperating with the enemy by failing
                            to take aggressive action against him. He then gave the opposite example
                            of the situation in the Plaine des Joncs where there is much action
                            because Colonel Cao provokes the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> to
                            combat and tries to select his own battleground. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> remarked that the same
                            thing should be done in other areas. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWC2">Trueheart</persName> commented that it should be done in all areas
                            at the same time. The President then pointed out the difficulty of
                            operating in certain areas where the people are dispersed in tiny
                            groups. One such area lies near the Cambodian border close to the trails
                            used by the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> to travel back and forth
                            across the line. He spoke of the necessity of regrouping these people
                            into “combat hamlets” but said that it would be more difficult than in
                            Binh Duong because of the necessity of building foundations for their
                            houses. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> told
                            the President that he could show him an “open gate” and indicated on a
                                map,<note n="5" xml:id="d277fn5">Not found. </note> a road which
                            crossed the border close to the point where the Mekong flows from
                            Cambodia into South Vietnam. In this same area, he added, there was a
                            “common market” which operated every night. The President then pointed
                            to a second area (Tay Ninh) where he indicated that the people were
                            dispersed like specks of dust. He said that the District Chief in the
                            area had announced publicly that the people would be regrouped. In fact
                            he did not have the means to do it but his announcement caused the Viet
                            Cong to send reinforcements into the area. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> commented that it would be
                            good if they could be provoked into gathering together. It would then be
                            easier to destroy them.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> then told the
                            President that he had recently visited the provinces of Vinh Long, Vinh
                            Binh, Phuoc Thinh and Phuoc Long. The President spoke highly of Lt.
                            Colonel Vien, the Province Chief of Phuoc Long, saying that he was a
                            “guerrilla” fighter who spent most of his time in the woods on small
                            scale operations against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> said that he was
                            aware of the man's activities. He agreed with the President that Lt.
                            Colonel Vien knew where the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> were and
                            added the comment that Vien had good Montagnard agents. He suggested
                            that it might be a good idea to give him some help—a battalion of troops
                            and some helicopters. If he <pb n="632" xml:id="pg_632" facs="0652"/>could knock out the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> it would be
                            easier for him to continue his strategic hamlet program. The President
                            replied that it was hard to catch <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> in
                            this area on the edge of Zone “D” and close to the Cambodian border.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> told the
                            President that Lt. Colonel Vien did not believe that there was much
                            border crossing activity. He added that Lt. Colonel Vien kept the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> moving so much that they rarely slept in
                            the same place two nights in a row. The President commented that Lt.
                            Colonel Vien was accomplishing as much with a company as was being done
                            in other areas with two battalions. He agreed with General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> were permitted no rest in this area.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> remarked that
                            the government had enough troops to keep the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> moving everywhere, all of the time. If they were kept
                            moving constantly for two weeks they would be so tired that they would
                            have to rest and they could all be killed. The President then referred
                            once again to the vast mountainous areas of the coastal provinces saying
                            that only helicopters could penetrate into them and that when attempts
                            were made to send troops in it took four or five days to reach their
                            objective and they had to come out after a week or less. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> pointed out that
                            the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> were in the areas and asked why
                            government troops couldn't do the same. They could be supplied by
                            helicopters. The President replied that, for two years, he had been
                            telling his people that they had to go to the heart of the enemy. He
                            then added that the British had advised him that areas like Tay Ninh,
                            where people were widely dispersed demanded much patience. A great deal
                            of money and time would be needed before they could be regrouped and
                            controlled. Priority, according to the British, had to be given to the
                            Delta. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>
                            pointed out that we have communications, mobility, regular forces and
                            the Civil Guard and Self Defense Forces as well as the Montagnards. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TWC2">Trueheart</persName> asked why both
                            could not be done at once. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> reminded the President of the successes attained
                            in the Delta during the past month and expressed his desire to see the
                            same thing done all over the country.</p>
                        <p>The President, illustrating his remarks by referring to a large map<note n="6" xml:id="d277fn6">Not found.</note> then spoke at some length
                            about the difficulty of containing the Viet Cong threat in the center of
                            the country. He pointed to infiltration routes, safe areas and remote
                            valleys in which the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> raised the crops
                            which sustained them. He spoke of the need for the construction of roads
                            to cut across the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> axis of
                            communications and to permit access to their safe areas. He pointed to
                            the new province of Phu Bon which he had established in the area
                            surrounding Cheo Reo in order to provide closer local control and spoke
                            of the need to apply massive bombing to certain areas in order to make
                            them untenable to the Viet Cong. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> assured him that bombing would be one of the <pb n="633" xml:id="pg_633" facs="0653"/>elements in the plan which
                            would evolve from the concept which he had proposed. He again reviewed
                            very briefly the many assets available to the government and told the
                            President that he need only say “go” and work could begin immediately on
                            the plan for a sudden, explosive effort to destroy the Viet Cong. The
                            President replied that he was convinced that the principle of the
                            concept outlined by the General was good, but that he was still of the
                            opinion that it would be better to expect that three years would be
                            needed to complete the job. If it were tried—and failed, he added with a
                            smile, people would charge General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> with inefficiency. When the General responded
                            that he was more than willing to run this risk, the President, said that
                            he did not believe that the Viet Cong was a worm which could be crushed
                            under one's heel. They had many resources available to them—including
                            Communist North Vietnam. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> then asked the President if he had his
                            permission to start work on the plan. The President replied “Yes” and
                            added that he would discuss the proposal with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> said that he would see
                            General Ty immediately and arrange for their staffs to get going on the
                            preparation of detailed plans.</p>
                        <p>As the meeting ended President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> asked General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> if there were any particular subjects which he
                            thought should be discussed with General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>. It was agreed that it might be profitable to
                            speak of the situation relative to Cambodia and Laos, and about
                            operations in South Vietnam. Also there might be an exchange of views on
                            press relations. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> reminded the President that General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> was on a world tour with the
                            object of bringing himself up to date prior to assuming his new job as
                            Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In reply to the President's
                            question as to the accuracy of newspaper speculation on General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>'s views on the
                            emphasis to be given to conventional vs nuclear forces in Europe,
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> replied that
                            he was sure that General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> felt that forces should be balanced to include
                            appropriate nuclear, conventional and special forces elements. He
                            assured the President, in closing, that if he became aware of any
                            specific questions, he would inform him.</p>

                        <p>Dear Congressman Langen: I want to thank you for your letter of August
                            28, 1962, concerning queries by Mr. Richard S. Anderson, Box 69,
                            Alexandria, Minnesota,<note n="2" xml:id="d278fn2">Neither
                                printed.</note> on our policies in South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>The military operation in the Ca Mau Peninsula mentioned by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGWJ1">Anderson</persName> was not a U.S. venture. It
                            was conceived, planned, and executed by the Vietnamese Armed Forces. As
                            in other operations, U.S. military personnel served as advisers and
                            provided logistic and technical support which the Vietnamese lack. The
                            operation should not be described as the brainchild of General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>. We would emphasize that
                            the Vietnamese are planning and fighting their own war in defense of
                            their independence.</p>
                        <p>Our military advisers do not regard the Ca Mau operation as a failure.
                            Although it was so described in some press reports, we consider it an
                            encouraging success. The Ca Mau operation was carried out in an area
                            long under Communist control, large stores of food and equipment were
                            destroyed, and the Communist forces were dispersed.</p>
                        <p>The objective of the Ca Mau operation was to frustrate large scale
                            offensive actions by the Viet Cong into other areas which the government
                            is now trying to secure permanently by different kinds of programs.
                            Vietnamese strategy is designed to clear and hold the countryside
                            step-by-step. This is accomplished by coordinated military, economic,
                            and social programs which give the peasant population the means and the
                            will to defend themselves. Because resources are limited, these
                            permanent clear and hold operations cannot be carried out simultaneously
                            in all parts of the country. But the Viet Cong must be kept off balance
                            in those areas where coordinated clear and hold operations are not yet
                            underway. The Ca Mau operation was such a “spoiling attack.” Given the
                            object of the Ca Mau operation and the nature of guerrilla warfare, the
                            casualties inflicted on the Viet Cong are in fact considered quite
                            heavy. Moreover, according to our reports, which are still incomplete,
                            the figure of 124 killed indicated by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGWJ1">Anderson</persName> is low.</p>
                        <p>Because this is also a war for men's minds and allegiances, we have
                            matched our military effort with a corresponding increase in our
                            information program. Today the magnitude of our information program <pb n="635" xml:id="pg_635" facs="0655"/>in South Viet-Nam is second
                            only to Japan in the Far East. We do not have our own radio station
                            broadcasting in Vietnamese, but we do work closely with the Vietnamese
                            Information Service providing advice, scripts, tapes, and technical
                            assistance in broadcasting.</p>
                        <p>We also assist the Vietnamese Information Service in the preparation of
                            various newspapers and pamphlets which serve to explain to the people
                            their stake in winning this war. Most provinces now have a daily or
                            weekly provincial newspaper which is distributed in the villages.
                            Special newspapers are prepared and distributed for the clear and hold
                            operations described above. The armed forces distribute pamphlets as
                            part of all operations. With our assistance, a net of six radio stations
                            covers the country with government information. Large village receivers
                            and low cost transistor radios have been widely distributed to receive
                            these programs. The effort to improve the Vietnamese information program
                            continues to occupy a high priority in our assistance efforts.</p>
                        <p>Economic assistance is also geared to the political need for providing
                            the peasant population with a stake in the fight. The clear and hold
                            operations include increased economic assistance to the countryside in
                            such forms as village schools, dispensaries, and cheap agricultural
                            credit.</p>
                        <p>American economic aid to Viet-Nam in fiscal 1961 was $127.9 million under
                            the Mutual Security Economic Program. It is $124.5 million for fiscal
                            1962. Until the present Communist attack forced us to increase military
                            assistance, about three-quarters of all our aid to Viet-Nam was
                            primarily economic in nature. The amount of military assistance is
                            classified for security reasons.</p>
                        <p>An outline of the Viet-Nam situation, our program and some of its
                            accomplishments may be seen in the enclosed documents. The nature of the
                            Communist threat is treated in the attached State Department document,
                            “A Threat to the Peace.”<note n="3" xml:id="d278fn3">None

                        <p>If I can be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to let me
                            know.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>After an exchange of greetings General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> that he was
                            much encouraged by the progress which has been made in Vietnam since his
                            visit to this country last year. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said that
                            he also was pleased with what had been accomplished and expressed the
                            hope that much more would soon be done. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> interjected a remark that in a
                            few years he and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> should be able to resume
                            their hunting trips. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> then said that the
                            target date for the completion of the first phase of the Strategic
                            Hamlet Program was the end of the year and that he felt that by that
                            time it would be possible to plan for the exploitation of the gains
                            which would have been made. General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> remarked that this situation resembled that which
                            usually exists during any war. There is a period during which an impasse
                            exists, and then, suddenly, a sudden surge to victory. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> then said that he wanted to explain to
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> what his
                            ultimate views were concerning the value of the Strategic Hamlet Program
                            and to review the general situation with him. He foresaw that the
                            completion of the Strategic Hamlet Program would permit the government
                            to switch from a counter-guerrilla concept to a genuine guerrilla
                            operation against the enemy. At the moment the atmosphere is not set for
                            aggressive guerrilla tactics. Until the Self Defense Corps and the Youth
                            Movement become completely functional much assistance from the Americans
                            would still be required. Ultimately, with the realization of the entire
                            program, the Viet Cong would be expelled from the villages and they
                            would then be compelled to wage a counter-guerrilla war. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> remarked that if
                            the accepted average of 20 to 1 is true it would certainly be better to
                            be the guerrilla instead of the person obliged to fight against him. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>
                            <pb n="637" xml:id="pg_637" facs="0657"/>explained that once the Viet
                            Cong are expelled from the hamlets it will then be possible to set up
                            special guerrilla forces to hunt them down, to terrorize them and to
                            ambush them, as they are now doing. General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> commented that President
                            Kennedy lays great importance on the lessons to be learned from the
                            struggle which is going on in Vietnam. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> then
                            said that with the establishment of the Strategic Hamlets many people
                            are rallying to the support of the government because they no longer
                            fear reprisals. He added that if the project is well done this support
                            of the government can lead to a favorable atmosphere for government
                            operated guerrillas and would constitute a solution for the problems of
                            all under-developed countries. It would mean a strategy without fear. To
                            further explain his theory Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> pointed out that
                            what is going on in Vietnam was in fact a political and social
                            revolution. Counter-guerrillas do not feel the need for revolution, it
                            is only when an aggressive spirit oriented toward a system of democracy,
                            by stages, exists that the revolutionary spirit necessary for a
                            guerrilla mentality can be developed. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> then asked Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> if at the lower levels of government—the
                            Province Chiefs and the District Chiefs—there was a better understanding
                            of governmental aims. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said that their
                            understanding was increasing a little more each day and explained that
                            there was a special training program for functionaries which required
                            them to come to Saigon every three months for indoctrination. He pointed
                            out that one of the difficulties in implementing his theory of
                            converting the Vietnamese effort from a counter-subversive movement to a
                            straight guerrilla war against the enemy was the question of how to wage
                            a real democratic revolution with cadres who are engaged in
                            anti-revolutionary activities. He hoped that the successful completion
                            of the Strategic Hamlet Program would result in the banishment of fear
                            and would make it possible to instill the revolutionary spirit in the
                            people who were in support of the government. He added that his concept
                            had to be expounded with a certain amount of care because many people
                            within the government might be frightened by it and oppose it. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> then congratulated
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> on the rapid progress which had been made
                            in the Strategic Hamlet Program. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> thanked
                            him and remarked that some people thought that it had been done too
                            rapidly and were a little afraid that, consequently, it might be badly
                            done. He went on to say that the Communists could not win the battle
                            against the Strategic Hamlet Program. They could continue to launch
                            attacks against isolated posts and win or lose the struggle to overrun
                            them, but to take over a hamlet they had to kill civilians. For this
                            they were hated and therefore were compelled to realize that it was
                            impolitic to do it. General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> then asked how the rhythm of construction of
                            Strategic Hamlets would continue. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> answered
                            that, with his American friends, a program of priorities <pb n="638" xml:id="pg_638" facs="0658"/>had been set up. General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> asked if the Province Chiefs
                            were closely involved in the construction of the hamlets and if a
                            general plan had been set up for them to follow. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> replied that the Province Chiefs and the
                            District Chiefs received thorough orientation in the program and that in
                            fact special courses had been organized to train them in their role.
                            Reverting to his original theme Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> added that
                            efforts were being made to change the attitudes of these government
                            representatives from their orientation towards a counter-guerrilla
                            aspect of their efforts. It was hard for them to understand the
                            difference which exists between counter-subversive activities and direct
                            guerrilla warfare, which is total in nature. The guerrilla counts on no
                            one but himself. Those who have been oriented towards the
                            counter-guerrilla concept have had the benefit of American aid including
                            arms, equipment and all types of supplies. They have been sheltered and
                            when they were sick they were cared for. The guerrilla has no hospital,
                            no supplies and depends only on himself-a reversal of mental attitude.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> commented
                            that this was a hard philosophy and hoped there might be some way in
                            which it can be softened. General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> asked how Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> thought it
                            would be possible to change the thinking of the people from one concept
                            to the other. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> explained that the Strategic
                            Hamlet concept was, in fact, a concept which consisted of a series of
                            phases. The security of the hamlet offered protection for the people,
                            the Province Chief with the forces available to him was charged with the
                            destruction or dispersal of battalion sized enemy units. The District
                            Chief had the capability of breaking up small regular units. Each
                            echelon dilutes the strength of the enemy until, at hamlet level where
                            the individual Viet Cong could be expelled, it would be possible to wage
                            guerrilla warfare. General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> asked how this could be done. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said that the most dangerous Viet Cong were
                            the small groups of terrorists and assassins who came to the hamlets to
                            extort, kill and kidnap. Within the defended hamlet the people are
                            protected from such activities. Although this was not yet guerrilla
                            warfare it was approaching it. The village defenders, Self Defense Corps
                            are given arms. The next stage, guerrillas on the side of the government
                            will be given only a method and an ideology. They will be loaned a
                            weapon, their ideology will be freedom vs slavery, their purpose to hunt
                            down and destroy their enemy. If we could succeed in this, we could give
                            a step by step political strategy which would be valid for all of the
                            under-developed countries who, lacking this ideology, are obliged to
                            seek neutralism in order to reduce the tension which is placed upon
                            them. General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> then
                            asked what political measures would be taken. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> replied that in the Strategic Hamlets
                            people, little by little, would be able to see the democratic system in
                            action. He added that, of course, up to this time there had been hamlets
                            and hamlets. Some of them had, as in olden <pb n="639" xml:id="pg_639" facs="0659"/>days, became oligarchic. Most of them, however,
                            operating under the principle of liberty and justice as the basis of
                            progress, and administered by a locally chosen committee were becoming
                            more and more aware of the advantages of democracy, such as the
                            increased yield of their rice crops, better methods of cultivation, and
                            improved methods of distribution. General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> commented that this was a
                            deep-level thought and asked if he felt that the people in the hamlets
                            really understood what was going on. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said
                            that he was sure that the people not only understood but were beginning
                            to develop a true democratic spirit. As evidence of this, he had
                            received a number of letters from villagers protesting that their rights
                            had been violated and asking him to come and personally intercede in
                            their behalf. He was fully aware of the fact that some of these letters
                            might have been originated by Communists. He felt, however, that it was
                            his duty to comply with the requests in order that the people might
                            realize that the government was in sympathy with their claims to
                            political rights. He said, in addition, that great strides had been made
                            in gaining the support of the people by amending the procedures for
                            loans to the peasants. Until recently, whenever a rice farmer had asked
                            for government support to buy additional land, he had been asked to
                            present titles as guarantees of his economic stability. Of course, only
                            those people who were the most comfortably situated could present such
                            guarantees and the course of complaints from the less favored was always
                            the same: “If we ask for loans it is because we are poor and do not have
                            titles to present as guarantees, if we were rich we would not need
                            loans.”</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> then asked how
                            many hamlets were projected for the entire program. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> replied that he foresaw a need for all
                            16,000 of them, in addition to the extra protection which would have to
                            be given to the resettled Montagnards. He spoke of the system of
                            “Jumelage”—a plan whereby certain areas of cities would be responsible
                            for the adoption of poorer hamlets in the most dangerous areas—as a sort
                            of less favored twin. One-third of the hamlets would be completed by the
                            end of the year. The final total would amount to some 16,230 protected
                            communities. He explained, however, that the overall success of the
                            Hamlet Program would be based on the so-called two-thirds
                            concept—meaning that if two-thirds of the populace of any given area
                            could be assured security the other one-third would automatically fall
                            in line. General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> then
                            asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> what he thought would be the time
                            required for the completion of the entire program. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said that he had paced himself on a period
                            of three years, however, he felt that with the progress which would have
                            been made by the end of the year the concept which had been proposed by
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> might
                            effectively be applied. General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> then asked if the hamlet concept did not, in
                            fact, amount to the establishment <pb n="640" xml:id="pg_640" facs="0660"/>of a feudal state. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> replied
                            that he did not think that this was necessarily true. He said that there
                            were certainly certain aspects of the “ville forte” idea but that,
                            within the hamlets there would be established democratic principles
                            which would teach the rights of the individual such as the right to work
                            and the right to own and exploit land, as well as the duties of a
                            democratic people, such as their obligation to respect property and to
                            mutually defend their rights. Up until this time, he added, the
                            government had been reluctant to speak of matters of immediate interest
                            to the individual. The President had stressed the ideas of duty and
                            sacrifice. Meanwhile, the Communists had been left the monopoly of
                            promising reforms in the field of private interests. Now, the trend has
                            been reversed, and there is, in fact, no contradiction to the reversal
                            because the general mobilization and the construction of Strategic
                            Hamlets has become a matter of individual interest. The basic support of
                            the guerrilla has been in the villages. If village support is denied
                            them, the maquis die of hunger. If the people become sincerely
                            interested in sociological and economic reforms there must result a
                            democratic revolution which will force the Viet Cong to go underground
                            and to wage a war of counter-revolution. It is this concept, explained
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>, that he thought would provide the world
                            with a workable basic strategy against Communism. It was the only
                            concept, in his opinion, that could be valid for people who do not want
                            either nuclear or conventional war, or who do not want to bow under by
                            adopting a form of neutralism. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> commented that there would probably be a certain
                            amount of opposition to such a concept. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>
                            agreed that this was true as for any theory which might be presented
                            anywhere. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> then reverted to his thought of
                            the two-thirds which could be sufficient to sway the total. He explained
                            that for each village which might consist of four to five hamlets the
                            idea was to provide protection for two-thirds of them with the knowledge
                            that the others would automatically go along. General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> then asked how many people
                            there were in each hamlet. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> replied that the
                            total varied from one to two or three or more thousands of inhabitants.
                            He added that it was only last year that the government had realized
                            that it was not the villages, consisting of four or five hamlets, which
                            was the most important element but rather the individual hamlet itself.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> commented
                            that the hamlet had as its origin the family group. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> agreed and said that it was in the hamlet
                            that traditions were founded and where the family roots and the spirits
                            of the ancestors could be located. The administration of the villages
                            was sometimes artificial in that outsiders were brought in to supervise
                            the activities. In the hamlet, committees were selected from the local
                            inhabitants.</p>
                        <pb n="641" xml:id="pg_641" facs="0661"/>
                        <p>At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> digressed to say that he felt
                            that something should be done to relieve the tension exerted on American
                            military personnel assigned to Vietnam. He thought that there should be
                            a regular rotation every two months for rest and recreation in Manila or
                            some other area outside of Vietnam. He pointed out that there was little
                            if any distraction for these people in Vietnam and emphasized the point
                            that, not only would it provide a different atmosphere which would
                            permit relaxation for the Americans, but it would lighten the burden on
                            the Vietnamese who had nothing to offer as distraction to the American
                            advisory personnel. He referred vaguely to the implications which might
                            follow the progression of the Vietnamese effort from counter-subversive
                            to all out guerrilla activities, implying that this might be bad for the
                            Americans. He then added that Americans in Vietnam should be provided
                            with sources of information other than the American books and the <hi rend="italic">Stars and Stripes</hi> newspaper. He said that
                            unfortunately many of them understood nothing of the problems of the
                            country and that it would be valuable if they were given access to
                            information concerning the Vietnamese viewpoint of the war which was
                            going on. They might, perhaps, not be in sympathy with Vietnamese views,
                            but at least they would be given the opportunity to understand them.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> said that the
                            American Embassy published a daily synopsis of the Saigon newspapers and
                            that it might be worthwhile to distribute this to all American
                            personnel.</p>
                        <p>In summary, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> repeated that he thought that
                            his concept would be useful for all underdeveloped countries and would
                            assist greatly in enabling them to progress to a state of democracy. He
                            pointed out that the Communists have clear cut, long ranged plans for
                            their designs on these countries and that no basic concept exists to
                            combat these plans. He added that there could be 200 changes in the
                            government of Saigon but, if no workable concept were offered to them,
                            there would be no effect on the peasants. He concluded by saying that
                            his theory of a revolution for democracy could not be implemented
                            without a war. The people of Vietnam were becoming more and more aware
                            of the fact that this was their war and that, with it, they would gain
                            democracy, new ideas, political and social freedom—in fact a complete
                            reversal of values.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>In his opening remarks President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> said that inability to form a valid estimate and
                            pessimism prevalent in some circles, particularly the press, was result
                            of failure to keep entire picture in mind at all times. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> called his attention
                            to recent objective New Yorker article by Shaplen. President next told
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> that <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> had been forced revise their plans to
                            overrun <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and that present <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> general plan is, in order of priority:
                            Disrupt Strategic Hamlet Program, intensify propaganda vis-à-vis
                            military, and give all out support to neutralist movement. In response
                            query from General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>,
                            President said he recognized value of helicopter support but stressed
                            importance of artillery, pointing out role of his road building program
                            to permit its deployment. The President next spoke of his recent
                            directive to strike at heart of enemy, keep him on move and to plot and
                            destroy all remote areas where <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> could
                            grow food or find safe havens. General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> agreed enemy must be pressed constantly.
                            President mentioned long-range—to 1966—air support plan, saying that
                            perspective of additional air power raised morale of people, gave
                            impression of governmental stability and carried implication that
                            program could be stepped up in emergency. President then mentioned
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> buildup in Tchepone and Attopeu
                            and said that possibility of Hitler type “folly” could not be
                            discounted. As evidence that Strategic Hamlet Program was beginning to
                            dry up <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>'s revenue within Vietnam he <pb n="643" xml:id="pg_643" facs="0663"/>said that his Consul in Hong
                            Kong had uncovered evidence that large amounts of piasters were being
                            purchased there by Communists. Some of this money was to buy betrayal of
                                <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> members.</p>
                        <p>In answer to General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>'s
                            question, President said that all 16,000 strategic hamlets would be
                            needed, in addition to a certain number for protection of Montagnards.
                            He said he considered that support of Montagnards trained and equipped
                            to go back to their native haunts would constitute permanent advantage
                            to government. He expressed doubt that, by themselves, they could be
                            entrusted with defense of borders and spoke at length of their
                            child-like nature and lack of initiative and leadership qualities.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> emphasized
                            that if Montagnards could be made into border guards, this would help
                            considerably in solution of border problem.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> asked if
                            President was happy with progress made since earlier <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> visit.<note n="4" xml:id="d280fn4">For documentation on <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>'s visit to Vietnam in

                            affirmative, stating Vietnamese were geared to idea of rational progress
                            toward ultimate victory. He added that two of most important gains since
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>'s last visit
                            had been acquisition of thorough knowledge of terrain and emergence of
                            competent military leaders. In economic field, President said, loss last
                            year of 300,000 tons of rice, exportable part of harvest, had been low,
                            but of course, it had not been publicized in order not give comfort to

                            crops, particularly in production of textiles, cotton, sugar and kenaf.
                            He emphasized that his aim was to develop an industry which could be
                            supplied from locally produced raw materials and that he had no interest
                            in “prestige” assembly plants constructed by foreign capital in return
                            for long term contracts for purchase of raw materials.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>This follows up on our conversation of somewhat over a week ago in which
                            I discussed with you Mr. Rostow's and my ideas with respect to devising
                            an objective means of measuring the trend of events in the countryside
                            in Viet Nam. We are particularly interested in measures of the state of
                            the relationship between the central government and the rural
                            population. Our interest is stimulated by several factors. Perhaps
                            because the population's sense of who is winning can be such an
                            important factor in determining its attitude toward the struggle, once
                            the tide begins to turn, there tends to be a multiplier effect. If this
                            is the case, it is particularly important to obtain some measure of the
                            way the tide is moving as a basis for pacing our own effort. Even more
                            important, we need such information, of course, as the basis for
                            adjusting U.S. and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> activities to the
                            changing situation.</p>
                        <p>We have also been impressed by the great disparities in impressions of
                            observers as to the state of progress on attitudes and the state of
                            government progress in the countryside. Probably much of this variation
                            is caused by the fact that different observers see different parts of
                            the country or different aspects of what is going on. It would be
                            desirable, if at all possible, to establish a system which would
                            regularize observations. Our thoughts on the subject seem to me to
                            complement and carry forward the suggestion that you and Ben Wood have
                            been developing for improving political reporting from the
                                provinces.<note n="2" xml:id="d281fn2">I have had the benefit, since
                                talking with you, of suggestions by Ted Heavner. Although this memo
                                has benefited from his comments, he was not asked to comment
                                formally on it. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> Our
                            suggestions are as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. Mr. Rostow has suggested that we adopt sampling techniques as the
                            basis for a reporting system. We might carefully select a number of
                            hamlets which are reasonably representative of the area in which they
                            are located, develop regular contacts within them and attempt to report
                            regularly on a series of indicators relating to them. Over a period of
                            time we could build up a body of comparable data that would give us some
                            idea as to trends.</p>
                        <pb n="645" xml:id="pg_645" facs="0665"/>
                        <p>There are some obvious difficulties with sampling under present
                            circumstances in Viet Nam. For example, there would be difficulty in
                            obtaining access to hamlets which are under even partial <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> control and probably even greater
                            difficulty in obtaining accurate information on such hamlets. Moreover,
                            if the central government (or district and province chiefs) became aware
                            of the fact that certain hamlets were being made the subject of regular
                            observation, they would probably devote particular effort to improving
                            the situation in those hamlets and might also see that the reporting
                            officer was given the “right” answers to his questions. It should be
                            possible to get around at least this last difficulty, however. For
                            example, it might be possible to select a group of, say, three hamlets
                            which were generally representative of an area and report on them
                            alternately.</p>
                        <p>2. It would be desirable to devise indicators which could be made
                            reasonably objective. Where possible they should be quantifiable or
                            measurable against some kind of rating scale with descriptive statements
                            identifying each point along the scale. Such rating scales are, of
                            course, familiar devices and have been developed, for example, by
                            intelligence officers to measure extent of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> control of villages. The following are some suggested
                            possible indicators of the scale and the effectiveness of the US-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> effort:</p>
                        <p>A. Does hamlet have an elected council? Was it elected by secret ballot?
                            In attempting to get at answer to the question of whether the council
                            election reflected true sentiments in the hamlet it would be desirable
                            to analyze background of members elected. Are they from traditional
                            local oligarchy? (The fact that they are or are not would probably have
                            different significance in different areas of the country.) To what
                            extent are they different from previous appointed councils in
                            composition? How old are members? Were they at the time of their
                            election, or had they previously been, government officials? Is
                            membership on the hamlet or village councils actively sought or is it
                            viewed primarily as an undesirable political and economic burden?</p>
                        <p>B. Are people in the hamlet (or village) clear as to where real authority
                            rests within the hamlet (village)? Are there perceptible differences in
                            attitude toward Council members and other village leadership groups
                            between the older and the younger generations of the rural
                            population?</p>
                        <p>C. How many hamlet council members (or other local officials) have
                            received training in the past year? (If we can identify particular
                            training programs that we consider particularly useful, this indicator
                            would obviously be much more significant if it could be related to such
                            programs.)</p>
                        <p>D. How many times has the district chief visited the hamlet during the
                            past month (or other time period)? Similarly for other provincial and
                            district officials. How long did they stay? Did they talk to anyone but
                            village or hamlet officials?</p>
                        <pb n="646" xml:id="pg_646" facs="0666"/>
                        <p>E. How do officials learn of popular grievances? Is their any regular
                            channel through which such grievances can be transmitted without
                            significant risk of retaliation? How effective? How are grievances dealt
                            with? Is there any machinery for this purpose?</p>
                        <p>F. Has the local military commander issued instructions on dealing fairly
                            and sensitively with the local population? What are civilian attitudes
                            toward local military and para-military forces and vice versa?</p>
                        <p>G. If this is an area in which the Cao Dai or the Hoa Hao are a
                            significant factor it would be useful to know answers to such questions
                            as: (a) Are there members of the sects on the hamlet council? Are they
                            district chiefs? Province or district level officials? (b) Were
                            (specified) sect religious celebrations held during the past year? (c)
                            Does there appear to be discrimination against the members of the sects
                            in the administration of government welfare programs?</p>
                        <p>H. What is the lot of the poorer farmers? What evidence, if any, of
                            improvement or retrogression in his condition? (Perhaps specific
                            indicators could be devised to measure progress and retrogression.)</p>
                        <p>I. What is the relationship between the farmer's costs and market prices
                            for his product? Is this relationship a source of discontent? Has
                            production increased or declined? For what reason? Does supply and cost
                            of credit seem satisfactory?</p>
                        <p>J. Is there an active civilian and/or military civic action program in
                            the hamlet? Does the hamlet council formulate the hamlet's
                            social-economic developments plans? If not, where is plan formulated? If
                            so, what changes were made as a result of higher level reviews? Do such
                            programs bring economic benefits to the hamlet from outside, or are
                            their benefits all self-generated? (In other words, do they appear to
                            rural populace to be simply another form of corvee labor?) Do they reach
                            the poorer farmers? More directly, do hamlet-dwellers view civic action
                            programs as improving their welfare and do they relate any improvement
                            to government (district, province or central) activities? Are taxes
                            collected? How?</p>
                        <p>K. How many actions were taken in the last six months (year) by officials
                            to enforce land reform legislation? (Would obviously need to be related
                            to relevance of land reform in a particular area.)</p>
                        <p>L. How many defections from the hamlet to the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and how many re-defections? From what age, occupational,
                            and economic groups did the defectors come? It would be desirable to
                            attempt to correlate figures on defection with such other indicators as
                            status of village guard, <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> forces in the area, hamlet council
                            electrons, etc.</p>
                        <p>M. How many acts of terrorism by the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            against hamlet or village officials during the reporting period? Against
                            other parts of the rural population? Was terrorism, where it occurred,
                            selective? What was the basis of selection (e.g., economic class;
                            unpopularity of officials; interference with government welfare
                            program)?</p>
                        <p>N. Has the hamlet been under pressure from the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> to supply food? What success has such pressure had? Has
                            there been any change in this regard and, if so, to what factors is this
                            change related (e.g., state of hamlet defenses)?</p>
                        <pb n="647" xml:id="pg_647" facs="0667"/>
                        <p>O. What is the capability of the civil guard, local self-defense corps,
                            and village or hamlet guard forces? (A rating scale for capabilities
                            would be desirable.) How many weapons (by type) have been lost to the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> in the area in the reporting
                            period? What is the status of defensive works (fences, moats, etc.)?</p>
                        <p>P. Has a radio been installed in the hamlet? Has it been used to call for
                            help? With what effectiveness?</p>
                        <p>The above list is very long. It would probably be desirable to develop a
                            reporting list in which items were ranged in order of priority,
                            selecting for the highest priority those which are considered most
                            representative and critical. As you will note, I have attempted to make
                            the answers to as many questions as possible quantifiable.</p>
                        <p>It is obviously much easier to outline a series of questions or
                            indicators of this type than to get continuing, reasonably reliable,
                            information on them. I realize, of course, that an outsider will have
                            difficulty establishing the kind of relationship to hamlet-dwellers that
                            is necessary to obtain this information although a skilled interviewer
                            could obtain much information by indirect questions as well as by
                            observation.</p>
                        <p>It might also be useful in this connection to devise several general
                            lines of questioning that could lead into these more specific questions.
                            Ted Heavner pointed out, for example, that beginning a discussion with
                            talk about crops and prices was often the best way to draw out villagers
                            on their feelings about their economic situation, government programs,
                            etc. Similarly, inquiries which begin with a question about how U.S. aid
                            could help the hamlet better deal with its most pressing problems may
                            lead to an exposition of unmet hamlet needs and the effectiveness of
                            government programs.</p>
                        <p>The above list does not adequately deal with one critical problem
                            area—the attitudes of military and civilian officials in dealing with
                            the rural population. For example, it would be desirable to devise a
                            question which would provide meaningful reliable information on the
                            subject of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> treatment of persons
                            suspected of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> sympathies. It is
                            obviously difficult to develop questions which can be meaningfully
                            reported upon in this area.</p>
                        <p>3. As a final suggestion, we ought to encourage the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to set up regular reporting procedures
                            which would cover as many of these matters as can be made the subject of
                            reasonably objective reporting procedures. What I have in mind is not
                            strengthening of the intelligence services, but rather the establishment
                            in a government department or departments which provide services at the
                            hamlet and village level of reporting systems that would provide regular
                            reports on such matters. Alternatively, a central statistical and
                            reports office might be desirable. In particular, those questions that
                            can be answered in a quantifiable way might be made the subject of
                            regular reporting. This <pb n="648" xml:id="pg_648" facs="0668"/>reporting would, for a number of obvious reasons, be imperfect. But,
                            over fume, it could provide some indication of trends just as present
                            figures on casualties can provide a kind of index number indicating
                            trends even though the absolute figures on casualties are highly
                            unreliable.</p>

                        <p>Dear Fritz: <persName corresp="#p_REE1">Ed Rice</persName>, having a very
                            inquiring mind and conceiving it part of his job to question all
                            operations in the area, has listed a number of questions which he says
                            bother him. He asked me the other day what the answers were and I told
                            him based on reports we have from the field. I do not have complete
                            answers for all of them so I told him I would fire them out to you for
                            complete answers. I hate to add to the burdens of your staff but if
                            someone could dig out the replies it would serve the useful purpose.</p>
                        <p>The following are the questions asked by Ed:</p>
                        <p>1. What has been the effect on the Government's base of support of aerial
                            bombing and strafing of Viet Cong-occupied villages, and most especially
                            of the use of napalm? (I have seen reports that the French are skill
                            hated in areas of Laos where they used napalm bombs.)</p>
                        <p>2. How closely is the arming of villagers being timed with their
                            assumption of responsibility for their own local defense, as symbolized
                            by the building of village defenses? (We have heard of cases in which
                            they do not get guns until they have beaten off an attack without them—a
                            test no sensible man would want to be put to.)</p>
                        <p>3. In what per cent of cases are village electrons really free? We hear
                            conflicting reports on this, and doubt that the villagers will really
                            support men they do not choose themselves.</p>
                        <p>4. Is it true that the poorest villagers, who must live primarily by
                            wages, are bearing the brunt of unpaid work on village defenses?</p>
                        <p>5. Does the Government have an inspection service adequate for
                            identifying and dealing with official corruption in the Provinces?</p>
                        <p>6. Is it wise or necessary forcibly to move villagers into new strategic
                            hamlets to the extent that is being done?</p>
                        <pb n="649" xml:id="pg_649" facs="0669"/>
                        <p>7. What more should be done to minimize extortion, stealing, rare,
                            indiscriminate violence and other misbehavior by the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> and Civil Guards?
                                (TDCS-3/520/576)<note n="2" xml:id="d282fn2">Not found.</note>
                            Should the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>, which is considered the
                            worst of all, receive the same pay as the Civil Guards, in order to
                            reduce its exactions on the people?</p>
                        <p>8. To what extent do high crop rents skill create conditions favorable to
                            the Viet Cong (TDCS 3/520/576) and inhibit full production? Would free
                            distribution of fertilizer to the respective tenant farmers be an
                            appropriate remedy? Are more basic reforms not needed?</p>
                        <p>9. How can we best minimize the extent to which we give the impression we
                            are replacing the French in their colonial role? Has the American
                            presence reached a counter-productive level?</p>
                        <p>10. To what extent is the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> handicapped
                            by <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s use of northerners,
                            Catholics and the Can Lao?</p>
                        <p>11. Where is the trend of support for the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> upward, where downward, and why?</p>
                        <p>Sincerely,</p>

                        <p>A recent cable (Saigon's 283 to the Department, attached)<note n="2" xml:id="d283fn2">Not found attached. Dated September 11, it
                                transmitted Task Force Saigon's weekly progress report that featured
                                an account of a conversation with <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> on September 7. (Department of State, Central
                                Files, 751K.00/9-1162)</note> contains a somewhat bullish review of
                            the political and military situation in that country.</p>
                        <p>Several indicators of progress are given in the cable which, taken
                            together, give us some hope that the various measures we have undertaken
                            are beginning to prove effective.</p>
                        <p>A. The month of August saw the highest enemy casualty totals since
                            September 1961: 3,297 total casualties, of which 2,284 killed in action,
                            379 wounded and 634 captured. Total Viet Cong losses for the <pb n="650" xml:id="pg_650" facs="0670"/>first 8 months of 1962 are reported to
                            be 19,404, of which 12,791 were killed in action. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> losses for the same period totaled
                            8,634 of which 2,984 were killed in action. I do not believe that one
                            can rely entirely on these figures, although I am assured by State
                            Department that there has been considerable improvement both in the
                            accuracy of casualty reports and the degree of checking done by our own
                            people. These figures suggest a 2-to-1 ratio in over-all casualties and
                            almost a 4-to-1 ratio in the number of troops killed in action in favor
                            of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. If these ratios are
                            sustained they will inevitably have an important adverse psychological
                            effect on the enemy. I have asked the State Department to re-check these
                            figures with the field in an attempt to get their most pessimistic
                            estimate.</p>
                        <p>B. Minister <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> also reports
                            that for the first time in 15 years the price of rice is dropping
                            between two crop harvests—a time when it usually rises. He accounts for
                            this phenomenon by referring to increased deliveries from the Delta
                            where clearing operations have recently been more successful.</p>
                        <p>C. The British, who have historically been most bearish on the success of
                            our efforts in South Vietnam, have recently expressed “cautious
                            optimism” for the future, and have spoken favorably about the progress
                            we have been making;</p>
                        <p>D. Although the evidence is still somewhat spotty, the results of an
                            improved civic program are beginning to show up in terms of an uplift in
                            village morale in some areas. The same is also true of the strategic
                            hamlet program, which is now being conducted more nationally and in such
                            a way as to minimize the unfavorable reaction which the villagers
                            originally had to being forcibly removed to new locations.</p>
                        <p>The attached cable gives somewhat more detailed information on the above,
                            and you may wish to peruse it yourself.</p>
                        <p>While we cannot yet sit back in the confidence that the job is well in
                            hand, nevertheless it does appear that we have finally developed a
                            series of techniques which, if properly applied, do seem to produce
                            results. Furthermore we seem to have developed a group of Americans both
                            in the field and in Washington who are capable of carrying these
                            techniques forward with increasing effectiveness. Lastly there is
                            evidence that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is gradually
                            coming to understand and agree with us on the importance of winning over
                            the villagers to their side.</p>
                        <p>There is reason to be concerned about domestic reaction to our policies
                            in South Vietnam. There has been a considerable amount of bad publicity
                            emanating from Saigon in recent months. Part of this is due to the fact
                            that the newspapers and news magazines have not sent top drawer people
                            to the area, and partly due to the attitude of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> toward the press in general. I think an
                            effort should be made both here and in Saigon to correct both of these
                            faults, and I am pressing the Department to give more attention to the
                            problem. Should you have the occasion to discuss Southeast Asia with the
                            editors or publishers of any of our larger news media, you might refer
                            to this problem in general terms. Perhaps <persName corresp="#p_MER1">Ed
                                Murrow</persName> could also give a hand.</p>

                        <p>At the end of August 1962, Vietnamese Secretary of State at the

                            Embassy in Saigon that he would be in Washington for the meeting of the
                            International Monetary Fund, beginning September 17. By August 27, the
                            Department of State realized that Thuan was coming to the United States
                            chiefly to discuss Vietnam with United States officials. (Memorandum

                        <p>In opening the conversation the Secretary referred to the prospective
                            serious cut in the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> program
                            emphasizing that this was an annual battle which was not always
                            understood overseas. As to Viet-Nam he said that we were moderately
                            encouraged and pleased by the initiative shown by the Vietnamese
                            Government and its troops. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> replied that the progress was much greater than
                            reported by the press. Whereas morale was very low a year ago there had
                            been tremendous progress in the last six months. The Vietnamese plan to
                            break up large <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> units was successful
                            even in Camau which had been under Viet Cong control for fifteen years.
                            Priority was assigned to this area and to the delta since it was heavily
                            populated and supplied so much food. The situation in Zone D was more
                            difficult due to the jungle terrain and the fact that one division had
                            to cover nine provinces. Vietnamese commanders feel good progress will
                            be made right through until the end of the dry season in May. As in the
                            previous two years the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> had attempted
                            to take the offensive and knock the Vietnamese out during the rainy
                            season. In 1960 and 1961 they had made big attacks in August and
                            September. This year they were unable to do so since their main
                            formations were broken.</p>
                        <p>The migration of the Montagnards away from the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> has been most important as it deprives them of food and
                            labor. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are not pushing them away
                            because they need them as porters and to cultivate the land. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> have strongly emphasized the cultivation
                            of food by the Montagnards and that is why the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> believes it is so important to kill crops in these
                            areas. If the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> can't get food they
                            can't live there.</p>
                        <pb n="653" xml:id="pg_653" facs="0673"/>
                        <p>The Secretary inquired what effect crop destruction would have on the
                            Montagnards. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> replied
                            that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> had set up a large program
                            to care for all Montagnards who may come over even if this cost more
                            than the 50 million piasters in counterpart which had been originally
                            set aside. A nationwide campaign to help the Montagnards is being
                            carried out. Crop destruction will not hurt the Montagnards since they
                            are leaving their villages. The food situation for the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> is difficult. The province chief of Phuoc
                            Thunh province told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>
                            recently that they are limited to seven cups of corn daily. He explained
                            that crop destruction would speed up <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            success and assured Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>
                            that he could distinguish between <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> rice
                            fields and those of innocent people. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> put a small hut in the middle of their rice fields. The
                            number of Montagnards in each province is known and new rice fields are
                            easy to spot.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary turned to the question of relations with the American press
                            stressing the importance of not giving the impression that Americans
                            were being prevented from reporting. Adverse press reports would be less
                            harmful than news that reporters were not being allowed to report. A
                            hostile feeling should not be allowed to grow between the press and the
                            Vietnamese Government. Sometimes the Americans can help quietly. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> replied that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> fully understood the importance of this
                            matter and that he was trying to see as many members of the press as
                            possible on his visit to Washington. In Saigon the Vietnamese Government
                            simply could not understand occasions on which the press deliberately
                            twisted the facts in a manner unfriendly to the Vietnamese Government.
                            He cited the report by Bigart <note n="2" xml:id="d285fn2">Homer Bigart,
                                    <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi> reporter.</note> to
                            the effect that President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>
                            was limiting the distribution of radio receivers to Vietnamese who were
                            friendly to him, pointing out that distribution had actually been
                            limited temporarily in the Ban Me Thuout area in certain places where
                            only Radio Hanoi could be received. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> said we face the practical problem that Sully
                            would write a series of very bitter articles and said that it would have
                            been much better if our Ambassador had been asked to have officials in
                            Washington discuss this problem with Mr. Graham, the publisher of <hi rend="italic">Newsweek</hi>, who is a very reasonable man. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> understood that
                            certain French citizens in Viet-Nam (of course not the French
                            Government) feel bitter about success of the American help to Viet-Nam
                            because of French failure. Men such as Fall<note n="3" xml:id="d285fn3">Bernard Fall, author of <hi rend="italic">Street Without Joy</hi>,
                                who had just visited Saigon and was quoted as saying that the
                                Vietnamese lacked adequate leadership.</note> were using U.S. press.
                            The fact remained that it was unfortunate to have Sully write these
                            articles at a time when there was such a difficult struggle to obtain
                            foreign aid.</p>
                        <pb n="654" xml:id="pg_654" facs="0674"/>
                        <p>The Secretary turned to Vietnamese relations with its neighbors, pointing
                            out that hostility between Southeast Asian nations was a barrier to
                            achieving international support. He inquired about the military mission
                            to Phnom Penh.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> replied that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> was prepared to send such a mission,
                            that the question had been delayed due to a new government in Phnom Penh
                            and that <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Prince Sihanouk</persName> had
                            asked that a cabinet member and a general be sent to Phnom Penh
                            preliminarily to discuss the question. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> was prepared to do this. Although it had few illusions
                            about the success of such a mission it considered it the first step. The
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> did not wish to worsen its
                            relations with the Cambodians since it had enough problems at home.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary spoke of rumors in Phnom Penh to the effect that the
                            Vietnamese Government was planning to overthrow <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Prince Sihanouk</persName> and said that these
                            rumors did not make it easier to steady an emotional leader. He asked
                            what could be done.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> replied that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> was doing absolutely nothing and
                            reiterated three times that the rumors were completely untrue.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> pointed out that the
                            reports of frontier incidents were usually very vague, that the French
                            maps did not delimit the border dearly, that when incidents would occur
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> apologized and offered to pay
                            reparations.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary inquired about a joint boundary commission.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said a joint mission had
                            been proposed for some time. But that the Cambodians would never
                            accept.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> in reply to the
                            Secretary's question as to whether the U.S. might suggest a joint
                            boundary commission suggested that the most important step at this time
                            was to get military representatives of the two countries together so
                            that each could see how the situation looked from the other side.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said the Cambodians were
                            principally interested in settling the complex financial problem. He
                            hoped to discuss this and the sending of a military mission to Cambodia
                            further with Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary summed up by saying that it was of the very greatest
                            importance to world peace that the battle be won as quickly as possible,
                            that the U.S. had demonstrated its very strong support and the American
                            government wished to emphasize its hope that the time would soon come
                            when the Vietnamese could return to more peaceful ways.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> concluded his remarks
                            saying that there had been two trends in Viet-Nam, those who believed in
                            the French static method of defense (judging by early remarks to the
                            reporting officer <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> was
                            probably referring to Vice President <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Tho</persName>), and those who support a war of mobility. The
                            latter view was now dominant. The Vietnamese <pb n="655" xml:id="pg_655" facs="0675"/>Government thanked the American Government for its
                            assistance which was most useful and was one of the reasons why the
                            Vietnamese were winning. He emphasized that America had made a good
                            investment in money and men in Viet-Nam. It should not be thought that
                            the war was over, the Communists would try to win either by big massive
                            attacks—which would not be successful—or they would use political
                            methods to seek to neutralize Viet-Nam. The Secretary commented that we
                            did not believe that any effort from the Communist side to follow the
                            pattern of Laos should be allowed to succeed. For example, the Lao had
                            been allowed to commence an airlift. The time to stop an airlift was
                            when the first plane came over.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary was then called away. Afterwards Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> commented to the reporting
                            officer that he felt there had been very clear mutual understanding
                            throughout the conversation.</p>

                            Deputy Director of <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>, Saigon,
                            reported to the Task Force on the situation in South Viet Nam. Following
                            are summaries of their comments:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Comments by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWC2">Trueheart</persName>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWC2">Trueheart</persName> said he was
                            tremendously encouraged by developments in South Viet Nam. The military
                            progress had been little short of sensational and the intelligence
                            capability had been greatly improved. <pb n="656" xml:id="pg_656" facs="0676"/>Training for the Civil Guard units had begun to pay
                            off, but more training was needed for the Self-Defense Corps. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TWC2">Trueheart</persName> noted that the Viet
                            Cong have not yet made any large scale attacks even though the rainy
                            season has begun and that this is evidence of the improved military
                            situation. He said the Strategic Hamlet program has transformed the
                            countryside and that he did not think the Viet Cong could now destroy
                            the program. South Viet Nam's government organization to implement the
                            program has improved and the plan is now better understood both in
                            Saigon and locally.</p>
                        <p>He said the biggest political move by the government was to convince the
                            people that Montagnards were equals. He said the exodus of these people
                            will hurt the Viet Cong and that the Montagnards have demonstrated they
                            will fight to defend themselves. He noted that the way to destroy
                            infiltration is to make it impossible for the infiltrators to support
                            and maintain themselves on the plateau. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWC2">Trueheart</persName> said that all these developments have taken
                            place since last Christmas.</p>
                        <p>Commenting on U.S.-Viet Nam relations, he said the government was now
                            more willing to accept our advice. He thought that interagency relations
                            in the U.S. mission at Saigon were excellent.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question about the border situation in Cambodia, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TWC2">Trueheart</persName> said that, since
                            there is no question that the Viet Cong are down along the border, there
                            are bound to be incidents. He thought the two governments should try to
                            develop some kind of informal cooperation between their respective
                            military establishments.</p>
                        <p>The one gloomy spot in the picture, he noted, was the mission's relations
                            with the U.S. press corps. He asked for suggestions as to how to deal
                            with this problem. The press, he said, believes that the situation in
                            Viet Nam is going to pieces and that we have been unable to convince
                            them otherwise. This matter was discussed briefly by the working group
                            and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName> suggested that
                            it be brought to <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_MER1">Ed Murrow</persName>'s, attention.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Comments by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWH1">William Fippin</persName>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWH1">Fippin</persName> said he had been in
                            South Viet Nam for five and one-half years. He stressed the cooperation
                            among the U.S. agencies in Saigon. He noted that counterinsurgency was a
                            new field of U.S. effort and that funds had first been shifted to this
                            work in fiscal year 1962. It was only possible to begin funding properly
                            in fiscal year 1963. He estimated that 25% of the mission's 62 budget
                            had gone to this purpose and 2/3 or 3/4 of it would be used this
                            year.</p>
                        <p>He said that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> was beginning to
                            shift its emphasis from creating an urban infra-structure to matters of
                            rural concern. The mission is now able to work at the local level,
                            instead of only through the <pb n="657" xml:id="pg_657" facs="0677"/>central government. About 1,200 radio sets had been installed and the
                            program was proceeding well. He thought the supply situation was
                            steadily improving.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWH1">Fippin</persName> noted that the
                            Strategic Hamlet program was directed primarily by the government of
                            Viet Nam and that our support was limited.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWH1">Fippin</persName> wanted to show some
                            films on the Strategic Hamlet program next week, which had been produced
                            by the Viet-Namese government.</p>

                            said he wanted to use the piastres which are normally used to repay our
                            old <gloss target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss> loans for a local development
                            bank. He hopes Viet-Nam will be able to use our local currencies in
                            Japan and elsewhere. This will be considered by <persName corresp="#p_HF5">Hamilton</persName>, but he thinks it will require
                            legislation. He hopes we will help in getting a loan from the <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss>. He feels this is very important
                            because of our “Buy American” policy. This would give him some money to
                            buy things that are essential in other markets.</p>
                        <p>He pointed out that we had given 160 million dollars in aid last year of
                            which they could only absorb 140 million on account of the lack of
                            availability of American products.</p>
                        <pb n="658" xml:id="pg_658" facs="0678"/>
                        <p>He spoke of a triangular arrangement whereby the French would purchase
                            rubber from our stockpile and release francs to Viet-Nam for aid
                            purchases from France. He was sorry that Spain was off the prescribed
                            list as they had been buying iron, steel and medical supplies from
                            Spain. The addition of Hong Kong did not help very much, particularly on
                            account of the certificate of origin problem.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said that he felt sure we
                            would agree that the main measures recommended in the Staley Report<note n="3" xml:id="d287fn3">See <ref target="frus1961-63v01#d93">

                                    Document 93</ref>.</note> had been carried out. He pointed out,
                            for example, that the construction of schools in Saigon were of
                            barracks-type construction, rather than permanent, and that the savings
                            thereon would be used in the countryside. He said the village political
                            situation had improved. The election of local officials had helped
                            create better feeling. The Viet Cong were having difficulty in
                            recruitment, more so than at any time in the past. He said that he
                            thought the villagers were generally fed up with the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>He gave me some complicated figures about the officers training school.
                            He said that this year they had the largest number they had ever had.
                            There were two thousand spaces but 2300 had volunteered.</p>
                        <p>He pointed to the fact that for the first time in 15 years the price of
                            rice had gone down at this time in the rainy season.</p>
                        <p>I asked him about the amnesty plan. He said they would try to get it
                            through shortly, perhaps the latter part of October or November. He
                            recognized it would have to be done carefully, at a time of success,
                            rather than of setback.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> thought the direction of
                            their psychological warfare was working out better in agreement with the
                            U.S. advisers. He was generally more optimistic now than he had been for
                            some time.</p>
                        <p>We discussed the question of the press. I asked him what they were doing
                            to get a better atmosphere. He said that the information setup was being
                            reorganized for the press and they were having group trips for the
                            foreign press to see what was going on in the country. He expressed
                            suspicion of the reports of the visit in Hanoi of the Indian Ambassador,
                            Head of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>.<note n="4" xml:id="d287fn4">On September 6 the Embassy in Saigon reported that

                                from a 4-day trip to Hanoi during which the Indian Chairman,

                        </p>
                        <p>I spoke to him about Laos in vigorous terms. “We are trying our best to
                            help you—now it's up to you to cooperate with us.” I said we couldn't
                            give him any guarantees, but their pulling down their flag in Laos set
                            us back. We did not expect them to retain their Ambassador; they could
                            leave their Charge. I said that if they had been realistic in the
                            beginning, they could have found some way of having a representative <pb n="659" xml:id="pg_659" facs="0679"/>from the North, rather than an
                            Ambassador in Laos. He appeared to agree and said he would telegraph
                            strong recommendations to <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>We talked about Cambodia at lunch. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said it was pretty hard to take the insults which
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> was piling on
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>—that he was a stooge for
                            the Americans. I said that if President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> could take it, I didn't see why <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> couldn't. The important thing was
                            to come to an understanding on the border problems in connection with
                            the Viet Cong. I could not guarantee anything, except I believe if they
                            sent an intelligent military officer to Phnom Penh he would get more
                            cooperation on the Viet Cong border problems. <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> had promised us that the
                            Vietnam Mission could go “anywhere at any time.” If that promise were
                            not carried out, we would certainly go to bat.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> believed that both
                            Vietnam and Thailand were conspiring against him. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> denied it. I replied that right
                            or wrong, <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> believed it,
                            and that was part but not all of the reason for <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>'s explosions. <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> had no intention of putting
                            himself in the hands of the communists. I said <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> could not neglect the fact that
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> had only French and
                            American military advisers.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> told me when I spoke to him
                            privately that General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> and the Viet-Nam military were getting along
                            extremely well and so were their relations with <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>. He thought the differences of
                            judgment and opinion had been worked out to the satisfaction of both
                            sides.</p>
                        <p>I had a word to say about improved political action, and he countered by
                            saying that support of the peasants would come with security and the
                            program for village improvement. He said it was impossible to buy much
                            U.S. fertilizer because it was too expensive and the peasants could not
                            afford it. I told him I thought the political and economic program for
                            the villagers should keep pace with the military and hoped that would be
                            kept in mind.</p>
                        <p>He said that <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> was not afraid
                            of plots against him at the present time. There was no group behind the
                            two Air Force officers who had bombed the palace.<note n="5" xml:id="d287fn5">Regarding the bombing of the palace on February 27,

                            been 13 people questioned. They were satisfied that the bombing involved
                            only the pilots. He thought that with the changes in the constitution
                            which were contemplated that some of the intellectuals would feel a bit
                            better about the government.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. General Impression</p>
                        <p>Much progress has been accomplished since my visit in October 1961. The
                            most notable perhaps is the snowballing of the strategic hamlet program
                            which has resulted in some 5,000 hamlets being fortified or in process
                            of fortification. Improved training of the Army, the Civil Guard, and
                            the Self-Defense Corps has resulted in freeing many more Army battalions
                            for mobile, offensive operations. The clarifying of the channel of
                            command between Saigon and Army units in the field has been improved,
                            but is still spotty. In some cases, the Province Chief can not intervene
                            in the command channel, but in others he still retains prerogatives,
                            depending upon his personal relations with <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The refusal of the Montagnards to accept Communist domination and their
                            preference to give up their homes and move out of the mountains is
                            another encouraging indication of growing popular support for the
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> Government. Finally, the
                            statistics—for what they are worth—indicate improvement in comparative
                            casualties, in the reduced loss of weapons to the enemy, and in the
                            freeing of a larger segment of the population and of the national
                            territory from <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> domination.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. The Infiltration Problem</p>
                        <p>Unresolved remains the problem of closing the frontiers to infiltration
                            through Laos and Cambodia. The exact amount of infiltration is still
                            unverified but there is no doubt that important reinforcements in men
                            and matériel reach the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> across these
                            frontiers. On the other hand, the improved patrolling of the coastal
                            waters leads us to believe that very little is coming in by water.</p>
                        <p>The only current plan to meet the overland infiltration problem is the
                            proposed organization of tribesmen in the border areas to watch the
                            trails and to report infiltration to reserve units in rear. It will be
                            sometime before this program is established to any significant degree.
                            Eventual effectiveness is uncertain.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>There is still no coordinated national plan establishing priorities for
                            operations against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> has proposed the
                            concept of a national levee en masse of loyalist forces to attack
                            simultaneously the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> strongholds
                            throughout the country. He has offered this concept to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> who has apparently
                            accepted it. It remains to be seen whether a feasible plan can be
                            produced to execute the concept. If it proves feasible, presumably it
                            will be incorporated in the 3-year plan which General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> is drawing up at Secretary
                            McNamara's direction.</p>

                        <p>The local Saigon press, particularly the American component, remains
                            uninformed and often belligerently adverse to the programs of the U.S.
                            and <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> Governments. Both Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> and General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> need help at home

                        <p>A great deal has been done in the last ten months to improve the quality

                            current impression is, however, that much remains to be done. On the
                            encouraging side is the improved efficiency of direction finding

                        <p>I was encouraged to find that there is a more methodical reporting system
                            to check than I had realized, utilizing American personnel in the field
                            to report indicators of progress in the campaign against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. This system consists of a listing of
                            pertinent questions, which are revised periodically, and sent to the
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> advisors in the field on a
                            monthly basis. A comparison of the most current set of answers with
                            those which have preceded it leads to a judgment within each Province as
                            to the change in control of the areas concerned. From this information
                            it is possible to analyze the relative progress of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in extending its influence throughout
                            the country. The accuracy of the system depends on the framing of the
                            questions and on the perceptivity of the advisor observers. The question

                                international commitments regarding Laos.” (Ibid.)</note> Cottrell
                            called on <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> and made
                            following points:</p>
                        <p>1. He was sure that <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> must
                            have received clear impression in his talks in Washington that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> officials were solidly in support of
                            Viet-Nam and our commitments to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> confirmed this.</p>
                        <p>2. It is a fact that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is just as
                            firmly determined to have commitments to Laos fulfilled.</p>
                        <p>3. This is why <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> statement it obliged
                            revise its whole diplomatic position and international commitments to
                            Laos is received here as a shock. It means that a western power is
                            threatening to pull the support props out from under the international
                            structure so painfully erected. It is imperative that western powers
                            fulfill their obligations to the letter and that any breakdown in Laos
                            not be caused by western powers.</p>
                        <pb n="664" xml:id="pg_664" facs="0684"/>
                        <p>4. While understanding <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> frustration
                            and anger over an <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> action which
                            touches a sensitive fundamental <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            national issue at the same time we understand <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has a commitment not only to Laos but to 12 other
                            signatories including the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>5. The British have undertaken to see that the accords are observed by
                            the western powers and the Russians have assumed a similar
                            responsibility for the Bloc. Therefore the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> contemplated action would constitute a blow against the
                            British as well as to the other western signatories.</p>
                        <p>6. Cottrell reviewed the possible subsidiary effects outlined Deptel

                            central point was that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> action to
                            carry out revision of its commitments to Laos would produce a head on

                            about the situation in Viet-Nam of interest to the Agency.</p>
                        <p>Foremost was the relationship of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            with the international press corps. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WDM1">Wilson</persName> emphasized the necessity of improved relations
                            and the value of organized and regular press briefings to accomplish
                            this. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> replied that he was
                            fully aware of the problem as was President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>, and that such press briefings would hopefully
                            start next month. On the general subject, however, <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> launched into a lengthy
                            justification of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s reactions to
                            recent events arising out of the Sully case (although Sully was not

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WDM1">Wilson</persName> countered by again
                            stressing the fact that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> had
                            nevertheless to live with the international press which created a public

                            wide. Positively, he made the suggestion that more use be made of press
                            exploitation of Viet Cong defectors. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> replied that this was already being done, though
                            only the local Vietnamese press was using these opportunities to best
                            effect. (<gloss target="#t_IAF1">IAF</gloss> will follow up on

                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> ducked discussions of
                            this question by talking about U.S. support of mass communications in

                            saying that with it the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> hopes to
                            reach Hanoi which had been impossible with previous equipment. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> made passing reference to
                            difference in policy with the U.S. over jamming. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> had on its own (and particularly before
                            the new 50 kilowatt capability) tried to jam Hanoi; for this, they used
                            former French equipment. Hanoi's strong signal often previously drowned
                            out the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s voice even on some

                            to make a plea for U.S. support of television for Viet-Nam, which, he
                            said, would bring national events (and <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>) immediately to the attention of the people without

                            20. During his calls on US officials thus far following points were
                            stressed to <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>:</p>
                        <p>1. Assurances of continuing US support and guarded optimism re progress
                            in Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>2. Serious US concern on question <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            representation Laos.</p>
                        <p>3. Probable drastic Congressional cuts in aid bill repeatedly brought to
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>'s attention. However,
                            no suggestion that Viet-Nam program will suffer.</p>
                        <p>4. Hopes that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would make every effort
                            alleviate tensions with <gloss target="#t_RKG1">RKG</gloss> with as

                        <p>5. Importance avoiding serious frictions between <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and US press reps.</p>
                        <p>6. Agreement with <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> that
                            International Development Association be encouraged make funds available
                            to SOFIDIV.</p>
                        <p>7. Awareness of financial sacrifices and reforms being made by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, assurance that US would keep close
                            watch on <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> financial situation, but
                            clear indication that a) <gloss target="#t_AIK1">AIK</gloss> charges on

                            feasible.</p>
                        <p>8. Importance finding all means using US agricultural surpluses.</p>
                        <p>Among points emphasized by <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>
                            were:</p>
                        <p>1. Provided adequate US support continues <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> can probably not defeat <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> by increased military effort and hence likely apply
                            more and more political pressure for conference on Viet-Nam. (In 1959 Ho

                        <p>2. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> successes in delta and importance
                            of Montagnard swing to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. Importance of crop destruction program. (He received scant
                            encouragement and was questioned closely as to whether it would be
                            possible destroy <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> crops without hurting
                            Montagnards.)</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> compliance Staley recommendations,
                            particularly currency reform, increased tax collections and deficit
                            financing. This connection sharp fall in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> foreign reserves stressed.</p>

                                President's views. (Telegrams 305 and 309, September 15 and 17;
                                ibid.) By the end of September, North Vietnam had agreed to
                                Chargé-level representation only in Laos and <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> did not break
                                relations.</note> The President emphasized that the abandonment of
                            the Geneva Accords before they had been tried would allow the Soviets to
                            take the position that they had been violated by the United States. This
                            would be disastrous. While understanding the feelings of President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> that he did not wish the
                            Lao Government to recognize both the Government of Viet-Nam and the
                            Hanoi regime, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>
                            stated that to abandon the Lao Government in this way would play into
                            the hands of the Communists, would endanger the situation and increase
                            the chances of military action. Noting that the Vietnamese Ambassador
                            had been called home the President expressed the hope that the Embassy
                            would be left open in Vientiane. He pointed out that although the U.S.
                            did not recognize Communist China, we had sat down with them at Geneva
                            and that there were many other things which we had not liked about the
                            Geneva Conference.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> replied that having

                                President described in <ref target="#d292fn1">footnote 1</ref>
                                above.</note> he had sent a telegram to his government.
                            Unfortunately the first consequences of the Geneva Accords had been the
                            recognition by the Lao Government of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> which presented an internal problem for Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the Geneva Accords of 1954 had in a sense
                            constituted recognition of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> acknowledged this but
                            said that the present case involved diplomatic recognition. Having sent
                            a telegram to Saigon he had received an answer stating that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> agreed to keep a Charge
                            in Vientiane provided that the arrival of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> Ambassador was delayed and that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> did not have the same rank as the
                            Charge from Saigon. The President pointed out that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> must have expected <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna</persName> to recognize the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. He realized that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> did not like the Geneva Accords, but
                            said that if they failed our common efforts and his own efforts for the
                            last year would fail. A treaty had been signed with the Chinese
                            Communists and it would be a great mistake to have the burden for <pb n="669" xml:id="pg_669" facs="0689"/>the failure of the Geneva
                            Accords fall on the Vietnamese Government. If these accords failed, it
                            would then be very difficult to get the Communists to pull out their
                            troops. There were three choices in Laos, to fight for the country, to
                            withdraw from the country or to do what was being done. If we were to
                            undertake the present solution, we should not stop 1/3 of the way down
                            the road. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> could not ask that the
                            Hanoi delegate be given a lesser position than that of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. It would not work, and it would mean
                            that the Lao Government would have relations with only Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>The President concluded that while the present arrangement had not been
                            satisfactory from the beginning, he strongly desired that breaches of
                            the Geneva Accords, to which <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> was publicly committed, should come from the
                            Communist side and not from the Free World side. He hoped that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> would explain this to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Turning to Cambodia the President asked what both the Americans and the
                            Vietnamese should do to ease the present situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> replied his government
                            was ready to ease the tension, that it had said nothing even when
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> had publicly called
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> an American valet, that
                            the Vietnamese Government was ready to send a military mission which had
                            been already chosen by President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>, but that the “versatile” <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> had changed his mind and now
                            wanted a Cabinet Minister sent first. He also wanted the Vietnamese
                            Government to pay the Cambodian Government 1 billion riels based on the
                            1954 Paris Accords. However, since the burden of the 1954 war had been
                            borne by the Vietnamese they could not accept in addition to pay the
                            Cambodian Government this money. On the other hand the Vietnamese were
                            prepared to ask that the French unfreeze the Indochina franc account.
                            This would mean that the Cambodians would get about 3 billion old francs
                            and that Viet-Nam would get about the same amount. Viet-Nam would only
                            agree to this unfreezing if it were done simultaneously for the three
                            countries of Indochina.</p>
                        <p>There was no doubt in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>'s
                            mind that Cambodian territory had been a safe haven for the Communists.
                            In Zone D, for example, there had been found huge stocks of medicinal
                            cotton. The packages showed that this cotton had transitted Cambodia.
                            Captured Viet Cong maps showed that they used routes passing through
                            Cambodia. No one knew the location of the border. When the Cambodians
                            accused the Vietnamese of crossing the frontier, the Vietnamese replied
                            that they are willing to set up a commission and pay damages.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> then raised the subject
                            of crop destruction, saying that this was vital for Viet-Nam; that if
                            they were to shorten the war by controlling their frontier, they would
                            need both Montagnard intelligence units and the means of destroying Viet
                            Cong food supplies. The <pb n="670" xml:id="pg_670" facs="0690"/>manpower for the Montagnard intelligence units were forthcoming as the
                            Montagnard deserted the Viet Cong. The Viet Cong in the mountains were
                            already short of food.</p>
                        <p>The President asked how it was possible to distinguish between Viet Cong
                            and Montagnard fields.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> replied that the Viet
                            Cong fields were in inaccessible areas not inhabited by innocent people
                            or local tribes. These are areas which have been used by the Viet Cong
                            for 15 years. Montagnards from the Kontum area have petitioned the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to start their crop killing
                            program.</p>
                        <p>The President again inquired how it was possible to differentiate between
                            Viet Cong crops and Montagnard crops. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> replied that the Montagnards habitually build a
                            hut in the middle of their rice fields. The Viet Cong did not. Also the
                            province chiefs had intelligence which enabled them to pick out fields
                            used by the Viet Cong. The Viet Cong food situation in the mountains was
                            becoming serious.</p>
                        <p>The President replied that the Viet Cong could easily build huts in their
                            fields. The United States was concerned that the distinction between
                            Viet Cong and Montagnard crops be clearly made and secondly that the
                            U.S. was concerned lest it be accused of conducting food warfare. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> proposed that crop
                            destruction be carried out by hand in a few provinces, pointing out that
                            the October harvest was approaching. In reply to a question by the
                            President, he named the provinces of Phuoc Long and Phu Yen, suggesting
                            that after the crops had been destroyed in specific areas the results
                            could be assessed.</p>
                        <p>The President asked when the next harvest would occur. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> replied that it would be in May.
                            The President indicated that he was willing to reconsider the matter
                            both in terms of hand spraying and aerial spraying. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> suggested that the Vietnamese
                            might also need some C-123s which they did not have. The President
                            promised to get in touch with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> and to let the Vietnamese Government know by the
                            end of the week.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired as to the status of the amnesty program, to which
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> replied that this would
                            be undertaken by the Vietnamese Government. He continued that there were
                            more and more Viet Cong defectors, that the improved equipment and
                            training made available by the U.S. was most helpful. He was
                            particularly pleased with the improved intelligence now available to the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and with the aggressive and
                            competitive attitude of the younger Vietnamese officers.</p>
                        <p>He had explained political progress to Mr. Wiggins of the <hi rend="italic">Washington Post</hi> and to the editors of the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> saying that a recent
                            constitutional amendment required cabinet ministers to come to <pb n="671" xml:id="pg_671" facs="0691"/>the National Assembly and
                            answer questions of the deputies. He had also told them about elections
                            in the strategic hamlets. They had not been aware of these
                            developments.</p>
                        <p>Economically Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SEA2">Staley</persName>'s
                            recommendations had been carried out with successful results. The Shell
                            Oil people were now able to reach areas where they had not been for two
                            years and for the first time in 15 years the price of rice was dropping
                            between harvest seasons.</p>
                        <p>A swing in the pendulum was also shown by the fact that whereas there had
                            been 700 volunteers for officers training in 1960, there had been 2,300
                            volunteers in 1962.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> hoped to make real progress by
                            the end of the dry season (May 1963).</p>
                        <p>As to North Viet-Nam he said that the carefully planned <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> air strikes were having such an
                            effect that Ho Chi Minh had requested the Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> to ask <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> to stop them as a gesture of good will. Ho had
                            taken the line that the U.S. was trying to make <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> a puppet by the use of air strikes
                            since these were completely under U.S. control and their increasing use
                            made <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> more dependent on the
                            U.S. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said Ho's own
                            predictions for the future of the war were changing. Whereas in 1959 and
                            1960 Ho had undertaken to win the war within one year, his prediction
                            for 1962 was 15 to 20 years. Also, the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, which had previously never agreed to negotiate with
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>, was now willing to do
                            so. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said that since the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> was “losing the
                            waR&amp;Rdquo; it was increasingly anxious for a political
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that this brought the conversation back to his
                            original point on Laos. Although newspaper correspondents had predicted
                            the worst in Viet-Nam, things were now better. Similarly in Laos it
                            should not be forgotten that there were strong factors on our side, and
                            it was for that reason that the U.S. wished to carry through on the
                            present policy.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> then turned to the question
                            of aid, saying that his government understood the reasons for the “Buy
                            American” policy. He suggested that it might be possible to make
                            counterpart Japanese Yen now in U.S. accounts available to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. The President promised to look into
                            this.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said that the
                            President's speech at the IMF meeting was a masterpiece.<note n="5" xml:id="d292fn5">For text of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>'s address to the Board of Governors of the

                        </p>
                        <p>The President concluded by expressing U.S. admiration for the progress
                            being made in Viet-Nam against the Communists and urged the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> not to be too concerned by press
                            reports. He assured Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>
                            that the U.S. Government did not accept everything the correspondents
                                <pb n="672" xml:id="pg_672" facs="0692"/>wrote even if it appeared
                            in the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>. He emphasized that if the
                            Vietnamese Government was successful, the public image would take care
                            of itself. In reply to <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>'s
                            expression of concern at inaccurate press reporting, the President asked
                            him not to worry. This occurred every day in Washington.</p>

                            recommended approval of limited crop destruction operation in Phu Yen
                            Province by spraying from air and in Phuoc Long Province by hand in
                            conjunction ground operations. We are not yet prepared to recommend
                            broad-scale crop destruction program until trial operations give basis
                            for evaluating conduct such operations and results vis-à-vis Montagnard
                            population and <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. Under <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> plans, spraying would be directed only

                            as <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>-cultivated or <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>-controlled area. We have recommended test
                            program in Phu Yen primarily because of obvious advantages in support

                            total food supply reduced but believe impact will be much greater on

                            taken care of through other programs. Moreover, Montagnard letters
                            described Embtel 302 provide evidence that at least some Montagnard
                            groups would welcome destruction their crops in order deny assistance to

                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in fact has provided us with
                            maps showing specific target areas they wish to hit. These proposed
                            targets would be checked out beforehand by <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> and we could restrict use chemical agents to verified

                            consider providing VNAF with suitable spray equipped aircraft.</p>
                        <p>Feel sure however that, if <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> carried
                            out operations with only such limited and indirect US assistance, any
                            resultant <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> propaganda would still be

                        <p>Regarding psywar aspects: <gloss target="#t_FBIS1">FBIS</gloss> reports
                            indicate Hanoi has sporadically been accusing US of conducting or aiding
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in crop warfare in highlands
                            usually lumping these charges in long list heinous crimes and without
                            special emphasis. Thus, we already being accused to some extent. On
                            other side of coin, we have detected no <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> effort
                            propagandize mangrove defoliation operations. We have seen no public or
                            private <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> references to this operation.</p>
                        <p>At same fume, mangrove defoliation operations have shown that <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> has adequate psywar capability. After
                            somewhat erratic start, it has conducted ground and air leaflet program
                            with credible themes. It is also able employ loudspeaker planes and
                            demonstrate “sprayed <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> soldiers” to
                            show that chemicals do not harm humans or animals, for mangrove
                            defoliation program, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has also
                            instructed Province Chief forward any claims for crops deshroyed to
                            Saigon for action and payment.</p>
                        <p>In summary, General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>
                            and I favor proceeding with the program along the following lines:</p>

                        <p>We have sent a round-up telegram and memos of his conversations with the

                            with the following:</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic"> Walt Rostow </hi>—Dr. Rostow was sympathetic and
                            perhaps the most understanding of <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>'s interlocutors. He urged adoption of the amnesty
                            program, pointing out that the most critical part of such a program was
                            getting the signal through to the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. Dr.
                            Rostow made three suggestions in order to improve and strengthen
                            relations between the Government and the villagers:</p>
                        <p>1. The organization of Vietnamese students from the towns to do civic
                            action work in the villages, not only to help the villagers but to
                            increase the students' understanding of the war which their country
                            faces (this idea sounded particularly good to me).</p>
                        <pb n="676" xml:id="pg_676" facs="0696"/>
                        <p>2. A conscious <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> policy to encourage
                            industries to manufacture goods needed by the peasants. This would help
                            industry since “a rapidly growing industry must be based on the whole

                            for the peasants. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> agreed.
                            He mentioned the problem of getting loans from the <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> and yen from U.S. Treasury
                            accounts.</p>
                        <p>3. Train draftees whose terms of enlistment are ending so that they will
                            have useful skills when they return to their villages. This has been
                            done in Korea and some Korean experts might help in setting up such a
                            program.</p>
                        <p>On Laos he emphasized that the U.S. was working with Viet-Nam in a life
                            and death struggle. At the same time we had responsibilities which,
                            while they may be of second importance to Viet-Nam are important to
                            world order and in the long run will be important to Viet-Nam. He asked
                            that Viet-Nam help us in responsibilities which are important to the
                            United States in its position of world leadership.</p>

                            with the theme that Viet-Nam must have as an ultimate objective a

                            reunifying Viet-Nam and having it defend itself as a neutral the more
                            Frank agreed that the ultimate should probably be postponed to the

                            problems. Made most persuasive pitch I could on need for <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to take a fresh look at its relations
                            and positions vis-à-vis its neighbors, and to take bold and imaginative
                            diplomatic initiatives for the sake of stability in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> and to prevent its own diplomatic
                            isolation. <pb n="678" xml:id="pg_678" facs="0698"/>Keyed this approach
                            to improved situation in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, pointing
                            out that under present conditions <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            initiatives would be reflection of strength and confidence rather than
                            of weakness.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, I strongly urged reconsideration <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> position on relations with Laos, reviewing President's
                            talk with them,<note n="3" xml:id="d296fn3">See <ref target="#d292">Document 292</ref>.</note> and stressing advantage to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in position as outlined in Deptel

                        <p>On Cambodian problems, discussed also at length, I urged immediate
                            dispatch of conciliatory note on Koh Rokar incident,<note n="4" xml:id="d296fn4">On September 10, South Vietnamese troops and planes

                            state intention to send <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> military
                            mission to Phnom Penh, the head of which could negotiate its terms of
                            reference, and which could be immediately used to help investigate Koh
                            Rokar incident. On debt question, I urged that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> break impasse by offering to join on condition that
                            Cambodian will agree specifically to debt settlement conference.
                                (<persName corresp="#p_VVM1">Mau</persName>, in his mild-mannered
                            way, hit the ceiling on this. He said, “If we gave <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> his money first, we would be
                            chasing him for the rest of our lives trying to get ours. I said I did
                            not think so—that a magnanimous gesture might be exactly what this
                            situation requires.”)</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_VVM1">Mau</persName> was noncommittal. He said,
                            regarding Laos, that he wanted us to know that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> position had been very carefully weighed by President
                            and Cabinet and it would be hard, if not impossible, to reverse. His
                            only concrete commitment was to try to pry loose a note on Koh Rokar of
                            type we discussed by “early next week”. I warned him that this might be
                            too late; that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> might miss
                            opportunity after so long a delay.</p>
                        <p>I proposed to <persName corresp="#p_VVM1">Mau</persName> that I see

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Then and Now</p>
                        <p>The Viet Cong were winning the war in October of last year. From January
                            to October, 1961, <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> regular forces grew
                            from less than 10,000 to about 16,500. From July to October, their
                            strength accelerated dramatically, jumping up by more than 1,000 per
                            month. In September, the guerrillas struck several times in battalion
                            strength. Less than 50 miles north of Saigon they attacked the capital
                            of Phuoc Long province with a force of 1,500 and held it overnight. They
                            seemed to have the capability of “liberating” an area on the high
                            plateau. They choked off the flow of food to Saigon, and the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> was forced to import rice and restrict
                            the sale of pork. Most important, morale had ebbed away much more
                            rapidly than real <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> strength was
                            eroded. There was an air of near panic in Saigon.</p>
                        <p>Now a year later, the Viet Cong are not winning the war. As in 1862 and
                            1942, no one clearly has the initiative. However, <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are clearly further from their objective than they were
                            in October, 1961. The most dramatic change is in morale. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and its military forces are confident
                            and anxious to get on with the job. There are signs that the people as a
                            whole now believe the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will win: the
                            army is getting more and better intelligence from villagers, volunteers
                            for officer training are at an all-time high, rice is coming to market
                            normally <pb n="680" xml:id="pg_680" facs="0700"/>and for the first time
                            in 15 years the price is dropping between harvests-a sign of confidence
                            that security is returning because it means Ace hoards are being
                            sold.</p>
                        <p>The political climate has changed. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is gaining more popular support for the war effort,
                            particularly where it counts the most—in the rural areas. By means of
                            its strategic hamlet program, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is
                            making a major effort to provide the peasant with more social services
                            and to introduce democracy at the hamlet level. Hamlet councils are
                            being elected by secret ballot. Schools and medical facilities are going
                            to the provinces. The military design calls for the defense of all of
                            the people, not just military posts, communication arteries, and the
                            towns and cities. And the people are being successfully involved in
                            their own hamlets. With a stake in the local status quo, they have been
                            giving a good account of themselves.</p>
                        <p>The implementation of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> rural programs
                            is uneven; it suffers greatly from a chronic shortage of skilled
                            personnel. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> remains basically
                            paternalistic; a nation at war, divided, underdeveloped and with 2,000
                            years of authoritarian traditions does not quickly or easily become a
                            modern democracy. But real political progress has been registered in one
                            short year.</p>
                        <p>Military progress is also encouraging. The basic need and wish of the
                            Vietnamese people is security. They are beginning to get it through the
                            application of a strategy based on defense of the whole population, by
                            the whole population. U.S. logistic, technical and advisory assistance
                            has resulted in sharply increased mobility, better communications,
                            better intelligence, and better performance generally by both the
                            regular and the paramilitary forces.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> strength is now set at 20,000
                            regulars. But casualties are high, nearly 600 a week and going up. The
                            guerrillas are troubled by shortages of food and medicine. Morale among
                            replacements is reported low.</p>
                        <p>Most importantly the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> have not been able
                            to escalate through regiment- and division-sized operations towards a
                            new Dien Bien Phu. Their largest attack was in September, 1961, when
                            they used 1,500 men. They have not “liberated” any area on which they
                            could establish a government. In short, the momentum of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> attack has been lost. Or, to put it in
                            Vietnamese context, they no longer have the “mandate of heaven.”</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Last Year's Problems</p>
                        <p>To arrest the Viet Cong advance and turn the tide, a two-fold problem had
                            to be solved. First, an effective strategy had to be devised. The body
                            of anti-guerrilla doctrine was meager, and much of what we knew was not
                            applicable to Viet-Nam. We had to learn how to apply our strength and
                            how to hold an area once the military had <pb n="681" xml:id="pg_681" facs="0701"/>cleared it. We had to discover how to involve the
                            people in their own defense, and we had to find ways to separate the
                            guerrillas from the people.</p>
                        <p>Second, we had to overcome obvious weaknesses in the Vietnamese military
                            and civil establishments. We had to provide the military with better
                            intelligence, a much greater degree of mobility, and we had to wean them
                            away from static defense. We had to train and arm the paramilitary who
                            take the brunt of the attack and who can relieve the regulars from
                            static defense missions. The military and the civilian government had to
                            work together as a team at all levels. The government had to streamline
                            its operations and really put top priority on the war effort. Some means
                            had to be found to cause the people to identify their interests with the
                            defeat of the Viet Cong. And we had to achieve more effective
                            cooperation between the Vietnamese and ourselves.</p>
                        <p>The Viet Cong strategy was simple to describe, hard to combat. They
                            sought to isolate the government, both from its friends abroad and from
                            its own people at home, and then to destroy it. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> tried to paralyze the government at the
                            rice roots by assassinating and threatening village and provincial
                            officials. They sought to win the people's support, or at least their
                            passive tolerance, through a combination of propaganda and threats. They
                            threatened the families of potential draftees, trying to force the young
                            men into their own ranks instead of into the government forces. They
                            told the peasant that under the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> he
                            need not pay rent to the landlord, they told the squatter that the land
                            was his. They exploited grievances and floated rumors of government
                            corruption. They kidnapped or killed the recalcitrant. Teachers and
                            village health workers were special targets because they linked the
                            people to the government and presented a benevolent image of the
                            national authorities. More than 250 school teachers had been kidnapped;
                            of these 100 are still missing and 30 are known dead. In the first eight
                            months of this year 3,300 persons have been kidnapped; some return, many
                            do not.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A Year's Progress Toward a Solution</p>
                        <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Devising and Implementing a Strategy</hi>. The
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> aim to isolate the government from
                            the people. We aim to tie government and people together, and to isolate
                            the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> from the people. Applying the
                            lessons learned in Malaya and in the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s own agroville program, the “strategic hamlet” program has
                            been devised. This program seeks to give the people both the means and
                            the will to defend themselves. The <hi rend="italic">means</hi>: local
                            inhabitants are armed and trained, a perimeter is set up around the
                            hamlet, and communications with reserves forces are provided. If
                            necessary—and usually it is not—the houses are regrouped from scattered
                            homesteads into more defensible clusters. The <hi rend="italic">will</hi>: the <pb n="682" xml:id="pg_682" facs="0702"/>government
                            provides the hamlet people with a stake in their own status quo, i.e.,
                            the hamlet gets a school, a maternity clinic, cheap agricultural credit.
                            And the people elect their own hamlet officials by secret ballot.</p>
                        <p>The strategic hamlet concept is the child of the British Advisory
                            Mission, our own military advisors, and the Vietnamese government. It is
                            still being refined and defined, in practice. There are more than 3,000
                            strategic hamlets which have been constructed during 1962, and more than
                            2,600 under construction. Some are well defended and the people well
                            motivated. Some are poorly done, and only half-heartedly defended.</p>
                        <p>We have devised a “hamlet kit”, including such items as barbed wire,
                            weapons, and medicines, and we are planning to supply nearly 4,000 of
                            these kits by the end of FY 63. But the majority of the hamlets are
                            providing most of their own resources. Our military advisory machine has
                            a special section working on the strategic hamlets. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has an Inter-Ministerial Strategic
                            Hamlet Committee chaired by the President's brother, <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName>. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has also set up a Strategic Hamlet
                            regional committee under each of the Division Commanders.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is well aware that the strategic
                            hamlet program cannot succeed unless most of the people are willing to
                            go along with it. Presidential advisor <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo
                                Dinh Nhu</persName> stresses the political aspects of the program,
                            bills it as a democratic revolution in the countryside, insists on
                            election of hamlet officials by secret ballot and high calibre training
                            for high calibre cadre charged with carrying out the program. As in all
                            underdeveloped countries, there is an acute shortage of trained people,
                            and the program is unevenly implemented. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has recognized this by publicly calling for complaints
                            from its citizens about corrupt or abusive behavior on the part of
                            officials carrying out the program.</p>
                        <p>Built around the strategic hamlet program, which is nation-wide, are area
                            clear-and-hold operations. These are coordinated military, economic and
                            social drives designed to permanently clear given areas of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> strength and influence. Four are now in
                            progress: Binh Minh or Sunrise in Binh Duong Province, Hai Yen or Sea
                            Swallow in Phu Yen Province, and two just getting under way in Quang
                            Ngai and Binh Dinh Provinces.</p>
                        <p>These operations are supported in depth by U.S. economic, psychological,
                            and military aid and advice. Plans are approved by our Inter-Agency
                            Province Rehabilitation Committee and money disbursed through project
                            agreements with Province Chiefs and local committees on which U.S.
                            officials sit.</p>
                        <p>While the strategic hamlets are being built everywhere and available
                            resources are concentrated on clearing specific key areas, we must still
                            prevent the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> from consolidating their
                            strength and expanding <pb n="683" xml:id="pg_683" facs="0703"/>their
                            control. Hence the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> armed forces must
                            not only seek to protect the new strategic hamlets and expand <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> control by supporting clear-and-hold
                            operations, they must mount constant spoiling attacks against <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> strongholds. The recent, highly
                            successful operations in the Ca Mau peninsula are examples of this kind
                            of spoiling attack.</p>
                        <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Strengthening the Military Machine.</hi> The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces have been increased numerically,
                            the regular army to 200,000 and the paramilitary to about 154,000. More
                            important, their performance has been greatly improved by the
                            application of U.S. technical and advisory assistance. Our helicopters
                            and our M-113 personnel carriers have given the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces much greater mobility, forcing the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> out of many areas simply because they
                            know the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s reaction time is now too
                            fast for them. The helicopters have added the vital element of surprise,
                            frequently allowing the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to catch the
                            guerrillas unaware at their bases. Although much remains to be done,
                            both the regulars and the paramilitary are better trained to deal with
                            guerrillas. They patrol more at night, stay in the field longer, lay
                            more ambushes of their own. Perhaps most important, morale is up. They
                            believe they are going to win.</p>
                        <p>As the strategic hamlet program and the clear-and-hold operations have
                            progressed, military and civilian cooperation has greatly improved. The
                            problem of Province Chief and military chain-of-command is still with
                            us, but so eased by the meshing of military and civilian programs,
                            changes in personnel, and government structural adjustments to the war
                            effort that it is no longer a serious obstacle. American advisors at all
                            levels, particularly in the provinces, have played a vital role in
                            overcoming this problem.</p>
                        <p>U.S. military personnel in Viet Nam now number over 10,700. The great
                            majority are directly engaged in advising Vietnamese officers and units.
                            They are doing an excellent job, both in technically improving the
                            effectiveness of the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> and in
                            building close bonds of real understanding at all levels of the
                            Vietnamese military and government. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> have made them a special target. From January, 1961 to
                            September 1, 1962, the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> killed 11 and
                            wounded 32 American military personnel.</p>
                        <p>The increase in U.S. military assistance is across the board, including
                            such diverse items as radar to detect Communist overflights for
                            intelligence or air supply of guerrilla forces, sentry dogs, defoliants
                            to clear dense underbrush on road shoulders in order to reduce ambushes,
                            helicopters and basic communications equipment. U.S. military equipment
                            and personnel have given the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>
                            forces a far greater measure of mobility. About 150 U.S. manned
                            helicopters are now engaged in moving <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> forces rapidly to whatever point they are needed. A
                            joint Junk Patrol has been organized with the <pb n="684" xml:id="pg_684" facs="0704"/>Vietnamese Navy and elements of the
                            Seventh Fleet to cut infiltration from north Viet Nam by sea.
                            Construction is underway to develop a Junk Force of 28 Divisions (20
                            junks per Division) for this task and for inland waterway patrols. Four
                            Junk Force Divisions are operational and three Junk Force training
                            centers are in operation. For inland waterway and coastal patrols, and
                            to provide greater mobility in delta areas, the U.S. has provided the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> with a total of 351 craft,
                            including 125 river boats and 177 LCVP (landing craft vehicle
                            personnel).</p>
                        <p>Intelligence assistance includes the assignment of intelligence advisors
                            throughout the country at the province level, over 200 in all. Eleven
                            Special Forces teams are training Vietnamese special forces. Advice and
                            assistance on civic action has included medical and sanitary training as
                            well as help on troop education and psychological warfare. A Joint
                            combat test and development center has been set up to bring modern
                            military technology to bear on the special problems of the war in Viet
                            Nam.</p>
                        <p>Particularly important is the training program for the paramilitary which
                            are bearing the brunt of the Viet Cong attack. Since January, the number
                            of trained Civil Guard companies has increased from 33 to 255, companies
                            in training from 13 to 64, and training centers from 4 to 5. In the same
                            period the number of trained Self-Defense Corps platoons has increased
                            from zero to 966, platoons in training from 53 to 220, and training
                            centers from 15 to 31.</p>
                        <p>C. <hi rend="italic">Strengthening the Government and Gearing It for
                                War</hi>. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has made some
                            important structural changes, notably the creation of the
                            Inter-Ministerial Strategic Hamlet Committee, which is in reality a war
                            cabinet, and the division level Strategic Hamlet Committees on which the
                            Province Chiefs sit under the chairmanship of the Division Commanders.
                            But the most important alteration is in attitude. The war effort is now
                            clearly top priority.</p>
                        <p>Signs of this changed governmental attitude are
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>'s almost fanatic devotion to the strategic
                            hamlet program, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s willingness to
                            undertake whatever deficit financing is required, general willingness to
                            allow American advisors to work at all levels, and a new energy and
                            drive that has significantly reduced red tape and bureaucratic delays.
                            Perhaps most significant is the clear recognition that the people must
                            be won over at the rice roots.</p>
                        <p>Although still not adequate, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            intelligence machine has been overhauled and improved on our advice. A
                            Central Intelligence Organization has been set up, … training programs
                            are now in progress, and a national interrogation center recently began
                            operations. Military and civilian intelligence operations are
                            effectively linked.</p>
                        <pb n="685" xml:id="pg_685" facs="0705"/>
                        <p>Similarly, the psychological effort has been stepped up. The country is
                            covered with a radio net; emphasis is on programming for the rural
                            areas, and our advisors are working to improve quality. Nearly all
                            provinces have a daily or weekly newssheet. The clear-and-hold
                            operations have special newspapers produced with our help and advice. A
                            general amnesty plan is being hammered out, and <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>
                            believes that by the first of the year the trend toward a <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> victory will make the launching of such
                            a plan a sign of strength rather than of weakness.</p>
                        <p>Training programs for provincial officials are under way. Every province
                            now has a training plan, a training officer at the Deputy Province Chief
                            level, and a training center. In Saigon a special program is operating
                            to train strategic hamlet cadres. The emphasis in the training is on
                            winning the support of the people against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>In January, as a result of the Staley recommendations, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> undertook fiscal reforms which included
                            a successful devaluation (which means that the aid dollar now generates
                            25% more piasters), and an overhaul of the tax system. Tax collection is
                            better this year than last, but more can and should be done in this
                            area.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> recommendation
                            that de facto administrative changes be accomplished by persuasion at
                            high levels, by cooperation with <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s aides who want improved administration, and by a
                            U.S. operating presence, has been largely effected. The job is not done,
                            but it is being done rather well. Our people have shown remarkable
                            ability to deal with the Vietnamese, to advise and assist effectively at
                            every level from the hamlet to the Presidency, to meet and defeat the
                            Viet Cong on their own ground and on their own terms.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is cooperating
                            effectively with us on counterinsurgency planning: our Committee for
                            Province Rehabilitation and the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            Inter-Ministerial Strategic Hamlet Committee are working together
                            closely. They jointly review and approve (or send back to the drawing
                            boards) plans for clear-and-hold operations.</p>
                        <p>Counterinsurgency project agreements are signed directly with Province
                            Chiefs, and disbursement of funds is approved by joint committees on the
                            ground. Priorities on the strategic hamlet program have been worked out
                            jointly—a major objective of recent U.S. negotiating efforts. We have
                            military advisers working with every province chief now; <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> has expressed great satisfaction
                            with their relationship with his people and with the results. Our
                            military participate in the planning of virtually all operations, and we
                            have set up a joint U.S.-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> operations
                            center in Saigon.</p>
                        <p>On the fiscal side, we have the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s
                            agreement to take part in the vital and sensitive business of drawing up
                            their national budget for 1963. This is a concession we have long
                            sought. On the information <pb n="686" xml:id="pg_686" facs="0706"/>front, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has agreed to the
                            establishment of <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> field support
                            posts in the provinces. Eleven have been set up and a total of 18 are
                            planned.</p>
                        <p>E. <hi rend="italic">Some Specific Results</hi>. Perhaps the most
                            dramatic recent success in Viet-Nam is the mass exodus of nearly
                            one-sixth of the Montagnard tribal population out of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> controlled areas. The Montagnards are
                            seeking protection from <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> exactions in
                            some cases, simply fleeing a battlefield in others. But a significant
                            proportion are willing and anxious to be trained, armed, and sent back
                            into the hills. These trained and armed Montagnards are increasingly
                            valuable in supplying intelligence on <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            movements on Viet Nam's long and exposed frontier.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> tried to increase their attacks
                            under cover of the waning rainy season, but did not succeed. The dry
                            season, which lasts until the end of May, will increase the
                            effectiveness of the air monopoly which we enjoy in Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>Since July, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> control over the rural
                            population has increased by an estimated 2 per cent. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> now controls 49 per cent of the rural
                            population, the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> about 9 per cent.
                            Communications arteries have been reopened. Roads which formerly
                            required an armed escort are now traveled freely. Night train service
                            has been resumed.</p>
                        <p>As a result of US-supported rat and insect eradication programs, a bumper
                            harvest was anticipated in the Central Provinces. Unfortunately, a
                            typhoon wiped out much of the crop. But unlike last year, Viet-Nam now
                            has adequate reserves of rice to meet this emergency. The program for
                            rural health is moving ahead significantly. Twenty-five provincial
                            surgical suites will be completed by the end of the year. One American
                            surgical team is already in Can Tho, three others will soon be provided.
                            New Zealand will send a team, Australia and the U.K. may also
                            contribute. We have placed 1,300 radios in the villages and others are
                            being rapidly provided for the remaining villages and hamlets; they have
                            already proved very effective in summoning help when the Communists
                            attack.</p>
                        <p>Third country support is substantial. Eleven other countries have
                            contributed about 108 million dollars in aid. An international
                            coordination group has been set up in Saigon to stimulate more third
                            country aid and coordinate it. The Australians have sent military
                            trainers, the U.K. an advisory mission. The June 2 report of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> on <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            aggression and subversion in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> had an
                            important effect on international opinion.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Present Problem</p>
                        <p>Viet Cong armed attacks are down, but they still average 110 per week for
                            this year. Government forces have suffered over 3,000 dead since
                            January. Betrayals of strategic hamlets and paramilitary posts are still
                            frequent. <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> intelligence is probably
                            still better than <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> intelligence. <pb n="687" xml:id="pg_687" facs="0707"/>The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> have probably made progress in convincing some of the
                            Vietnamese people and some of the uncommitted nations that Viet-Nam
                            should be neutralized on the Laos pattern. Pressures for a conference on
                            Viet-Nam, while not yet serious, may be expected to increase,
                            particularly if the Viet-Cong continue to suffer military reverses.</p>
                        <p>The possibility remains that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> will
                            decide to escalate the war by a dramatic increase in the quantity and
                            quality of infiltration. The <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>
                            presence discourages this, but does not obviate the possibility. Perhaps
                            the greatest deterrent is the knowledge that escalation to the kind of
                            near conventional war the Viet Minh fought against the French in the
                            later stages of that struggle would make the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> forces more vulnerable to reactions from our
                            conventional arms.</p>
                        <p>Probably the most important problem is simply keeping up the momentum of
                            our joint efforts. This promises to be a long struggle. A shortage of
                            piaster resources coupled with the U.S. gold problem is already
                            troublesome. Continued sacrifice by the Vietnamese people and armed
                            forces may produce war weariness. American casualties can be expected to
                            increase. Our aid input must go on for a long time.</p>
                        <p>We shall intensify pressures for increased contributions from the
                            Vietnamese and from other countries. But the best way to save American
                            money will be the achievement of peace in Viet-Nam. We do not intend to
                            achieve this by surrendering Viet-Nam's independence at a Conference.
                            The war in Viet-Nam is costing us about one per cent of our military
                            budget. By next spring we may be able to predict whether the peak of
                            these expenditures has been passed.</p>
                        <p>The Viet-Nam war is important. For Americans it has proved among other
                            things that our people can live in the provinces and villages with Asian
                            peasants and help them hold off the Communists and improve their lot. On
                            a larger scale, a Communist victory would have a strong impact on all of
                            our allies by tending to devalue our commitments to them. It would
                            provide the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> with the rice surplus it
                            so badly needs, add 14 million vigorous people to the Communist Bloc,
                            and give the Bloc a strategic salient into the heart of Free Asia. A
                            victory for us would prove that our people can live in the villages with
                            Asians and help them, that underdeveloped nations can defeat “wars of
                            liberation” with our help, strike a telling blow to the mystique of the
                            “wave of the future”, and save the tough and hard fighting Vietnamese
                            people from the Communist regime they manifestly do not want.</p>

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> showed that
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> battalion-sized operations had
                            declined steadily. There were 8 in May, 1 each in June and July, and
                            none in August or September. On the other hand, <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> battalion-sized operations had increased from 156 to a
                            high of 454 in August, down to 378 in September. VNAF sorties had
                            increased from 150 in January to 628 in September. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> commented that evidence from
                            the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> showed that these operations were
                            hurting them and that there was no evidence from the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> that they considered they were getting
                            any propaganda advantages from them.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> and General
                                <persName corresp="#p_ABGRH1">Anthis</persName> pointed out that
                            American pilots are flying 100 hours a month which could not be
                            maintained and that more planes and personnel were needed now.</p>
                        <pb n="689" xml:id="pg_689" facs="0709"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated that
                            the initial objective was for US <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to carry the
                            burden of the combat. The following objectives were agreed upon:</p>
                        <p>a) To get a B-26 unit flown by Vietnamese pilots into action as soon as
                            possible. In this connection to explore the use of VN C-47 pilots for
                            B-26s, and the possible use of Chinese pilots in C-47s.</p>
                        <p>b) To expand the VNAF as fast as possible, having in mind <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>'s estimate that it could be
                            expanded to 10,000.</p>
                        <p>c) Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said “If
                            you really want more US pilots, make recommendations, but they will be
                            received coolly”. The Secretary emphasized that our objectives are to
                            help the Vietnamese fight their war and to reduce, not increase, our own
                            combat role.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_ABGRH1">Anthis</persName> showed that
                            Farmgate operations had been successful in convoying trucks. An average
                            of 32 convoys a month had been escorted by planes from January through
                            June and this had increased to 178 in September. None of the convoys had
                            so far been ambushed.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> continued that
                            generally Vietnamese troops were staying out longer. One battalion had
                            stayed out for 3 weeks. However, there were cases where Vietnamese
                            soldiers were not as fit nor as well-led as they should be. Recently one
                            group had eaten up all their food too soon and gotten their feet wet,
                            etc., to the point where they had to be pulled back prematurely. The
                            Ninth Division was now operational, the 26th Division (which would be
                            Viet-Nam's 10th) was due in January. Two additional VN airborne
                            battalions and 2 VN Marine battalions are now ready. (General <persName corresp="#p_TMGC1">Timmes</persName> commented before the meeting
                            that there are now 4 Vietnamese paratroop battalions, but that they were
                            not much used; this was partly because it was easier to get troops in
                            and out by helicopters.) The men and organizations needed to handle the
                            last large arrivals of M113s and M114 personnel carriers are now ready.
                            (The Secretary commented that although these vehicles are in short
                            supply, more could be made available for Viet-Nam if needed.) Staff
                            planning had improved but was still weak. Logistic support was better.
                            CO and DOC training would be finished as scheduled by the end of the
                            year. Mobile training teams for these outfits had not worked out well,
                            but some of it was being continued. There was a new airfield at Pleiku.
                            Helicopter training was now being carried out in Viet-Nam. Civilian
                            Irregular Defence Groups (CIDG) had made good progress. The Strategic
                            Hamlet program was OK. Intelligence had shown great improvement and was
                            being better used.</p>
                        <p>Defoliation operations in the Delta were very successful. Six target
                            areas would soon be finished. 100,000 leaflets were dropped each time
                            one of these operations was carried out. (Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> asked for further
                            recommendations on defoliation. As to crop destruction, he told General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> to assume that he
                            could get rapid Washington <pb n="690" xml:id="pg_690" facs="0710"/>approval for substitution of test sites providing the same high
                            standard of choosing these sites was maintained. It was agreed that
                            General Delmore <note n="3" xml:id="d298fn3">Brigadier General Fred J.
                                Delmore, U.S. Army.</note> who was then in Honolulu would be sent
                            back to Saigon to supervise crop destruction.)</p>
                        <p>54 junks had been delivered and although there was squabbling amongst the
                            contractors, another 143 were to be delivered during October. There had
                            been no sabotage recently in this program. The tropo-scatter was
                            working.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> then presented
                            his ideas for an explosive type operation. The concept had been approved
                            by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> and President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>. Even if there are
                            30,000 hard-core <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> as estimated by the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> (the US estimate is 20,000)
                            their forces were far inferior to the Vietnamese who have the equivalent
                            of 51 trained divisions. The objective, therefore, is to conduct a
                            nation-wide offensive to exert sudden and continuing pressure on known
                            areas of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> concentration. This required
                            a planning phase, a preparatory phase, which would include saturation
                            bombing against <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> installations,
                            especially in Zone D. Theoretically the explosive phase would consist of
                            full-scale coordinated operations exploding at every level from the rice
                            roots to the national level and finally follow-up operations. In
                            replying to a question from General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>, General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> said that such an operation might have to be
                            repeated several times. He emphasized the preparations which would be
                            made, particularly in the chain of command which would eliminate the
                            field command and bring it to General Ty's Joint Command Staff. (This
                            had been accepted in principle by President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>.) Improvement would also be made in the disposition
                            of Vietnamese troops, prepositioning of equipment, intelligence
                            training, planning, etc.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> did not have
                            time to present his plan for phasing out US personnel in Viet-Nam within
                            3 years. It is understood that this would involve large increases in the
                            US <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> for the next 3 years and for the
                            Vietnamese Defense budget. It would also involve very large increases in
                            the number of Vietnamese under arms. For example, an increase of the
                                <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> to about 140.000.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Armed Helicopters</hi> (Corridor Discussion)</p>
                        <p>Several officers were asked about the July recommendation that
                            helicopters be armed. The answers were generally unclear and somewhat
                            discouraging. General <persName corresp="#p_ABGRH1">Anthis</persName> pointed out that it was difficult to fire
                            accurately from an armed helicopter due to vibration and that it
                            presented a relatively stationary target to <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> on the ground. He recognizes the political importance of
                            improving protection for US helicopter crews and agreed that the
                            helicopters should be armed, at least to <pb n="691" xml:id="pg_691" facs="0711"/>see what could be done to improve the situation. Major
                            General <persName corresp="#p_RMGEL1">Rowny</persName> who has
                            participated in the field tests leading to the Howza (?)<note n="4" xml:id="d298fn4">The question mark appears on the source
                                text.</note> report, and who is going to Viet-Nam to supervise
                            research and development, was more optimistic. He was also anxious to
                            conduct experiments in mounting 2.75 inch recoilless artillery in
                            helicopters. This would permit the helicopters to remain at a greater
                            distance and still inflict damage on the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. Both he and General <persName corresp="#p_ABGRH1">Anthis</persName> agreed that the best helicopter operation was to
                            use fixed-wing aircraft to soften up an area with bombs, napalm, and
                            strafing, then bring in the helicopters as quickly as possible.</p>
                        <p>… the reason for the delay in arming helicopters was the Air Force
                            reluctance to have the Army demonstrate that its helicopters could be
                            effectively armed. This was certainly reflected in remarks by Anthis to
                            the effect that the helicopters were not designed as armed vehicles.</p>

                        <p>423. Had talk with <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> today in
                            his Office at Presidency. After we had covered wide range of subjects, I
                            said I had inferred from his remarks that there was nothing to the
                            rumors that he had resigned from any or all of his jobs because of
                            President's displeasure concerning the alleged lottery scandal.<note n="2" xml:id="d299fn2">In mid-September it was discovered that the
                                Vietnamese National Treasury was missing 44 million piasters owned
                                by the distributor of the national lottery tickets.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> directly confirmed that he
                            had neither resigned nor been asked to resign. He said when he returned
                            from America and Europe on October 5, he had immediately heard stories
                            that he was in disgrace because of involvement in a lottery scandal. He
                            recalled he had called me the next day and in response to my questioning
                            as to how he was, he had said, “I am trying to find my way around”. He
                            said he meant that he had not at that time seen President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> and didn't know what this was all
                            about. He said <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName> had
                            told him that apparently his enemies were out to get him. I asked who
                            these enemies were, and he said a number of non-Communist Vietnamese who
                            thought he had become too powerful and, of course, the Viet Cong. He
                            mentioned in the former category a number of businessmen and
                            professional men who, he said, for reasons of their own, opposed the
                            57th tax, the stricter enforcement of income declarations and
                            collections, the draft of officers and doctors, and other measures which
                            he had advocated.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said he went to the
                            President directly as soon as he could get to see him and asked him
                            bluntly whether there was any basis to the rumors that the President was
                            embarrassed or irate because of any actions of his or his wife's; if so,
                            he offered his resignation. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>
                            said President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> said there
                            was no basis to the rumors that <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> was in disgrace, that he had had the matter
                            personally investigated and was convinced that <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> had nothing to do with it, and
                            that he wished him to continue in his present duties. Since then, as was
                            evident from <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>'s previous
                            discussion with me on matters recently discussed with <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>, he has been active in all phases
                            of his previous work.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> I was delighted to
                            hear this and asked whether this applied to other members of the
                            Cabinet, about whom there were similar rumors. He said that to his
                            knowledge it applied to <persName corresp="#p_VVM1">Vu Van
                                Mau</persName>, Nguyen Luong (Minister of Finance), and Nguyen Van
                            Luong (Minister of Justice). I asked about Dr. Tuyen and Minister Ngo
                            Trong <pb n="693" xml:id="pg_693" facs="0713"/>Hieu. He said he did not
                            know about Dr. Tuyen, since he was not a Cabinet minister and was always
                            involved in “secret undertakings about which I know little”. He also
                            said he had not heard anything about the present status of Hieu.</p>
                        <p>While <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> did not state
                            specifically that there was no irregularity or scandal concerning the
                            national lottery (nor did I ask him this directly), he did state that
                            the rumors that his wife had been involved and arrested were absolutely
                            false and the rumor that Madam Duc Loi was an aunt of his was absolutely
                            false. He said that he did not know her. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> added that it seemed that every time he went away
                            there was a concerted attempt to cut him down, mentioning his trip to
                            Formosa in February and the fact that before he could get back after the
                            bombing there were rumors afloat that he was responsible. He also
                            remarked that all of those who were allegedly implicated in this affair
                            were northerners, who, he implied, were special targets of other
                            Saigonnaise factions.</p>
                        <p>One other point stated by <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>:
                            he said an important telegram he sent to President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> after his talk with President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> on Laos recognition
                            problem and crop defoliation had never been received by <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> or by <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>.
                            The telegram had been received by <persName corresp="#p_VVM1">Vu Van
                                Mau</persName>, who had sent it in two copies, as is customary, to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> and to Counselor
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>, but neither had received it. This
                            indicated to his mind that someone in the palace was either negligent or
                            untrustworthy.</p>

                        <p>Dear Fritz: As you know I remain concerned about the dangers of
                            over-optimism in Viet-Nam. I am well aware that things are much improved
                            since last year and I want you to know again how much credit you and the
                            other members of the Saigon Task Force deserve. Although the tide may be
                            turning in Viet-Nam, there is a danger that certain very serious
                            problems may not be receiving the attention and <pb n="694" xml:id="pg_694" facs="0714"/>action which they deserve here in
                            Washington. I think we are by far safer in carrying out the President's
                            directive to save Viet-Nam if we lean in the direction of emphasizing
                            our problems rather than our successes. In this connection I would
                            appreciate your full and unvarnished views on the following matters
                            which have come to my attention during and after the Honolulu
                                Meeting.<note n="2" xml:id="d300fn2">See <ref target="#d298">Document 298</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1) Are the villagers being armed fast enough? I take it that their
                            priority comes after the Army, the Civil Guard, and the Self Defense
                            Corps, and yet they are the ones who must usually resist the first
                            attack until the Army, Civil Guard or Self Defense Corps can come to
                            their assistance. It is my understanding that in the average village of
                            about 2,000 inhabitants there are approximately 50 Republican Youth who
                            are natives in the village who must resist the first attack and that
                            there are not usually more than 10 rifles of ancient vintage available
                            to them. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> has
                            made it clear that we have plenty of rifles, carbines, etc. I would like
                            to know if we can do more now to arm villagers who have received a
                            reasonable degree of training from Civic Action teams or from the
                            Popular Forces.</p>
                        <p>2) I gather that there have been delays in the arming of helicopters
                            despite the fact that at the July Honolulu Meeting<note n="3" xml:id="d300fn3">See <ref target="#d248">Document 248</ref>.</note>
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that
                            helicopters should be armed as rapidly as possible. From what I
                            understand, the Air Force prefers the strategy of bombing and strafing
                            an area with fixed-wing aircraft before bringing in helicopters. I also
                            understand that they prefer this method because it would give them a
                            larger role than arming helicopters which do not belong to the Air
                            Force. While bombing and strafing an area before bringing in helicopters
                            may provide greater safety it also runs the risk of killing more
                            innocent Vietnamese. I hope that Major General <persName corresp="#p_RMGEL1">Rowny</persName>, who I understand has recently
                            arrived in Viet-Nam to be in charge of Combat Development and Testing,
                            will push ahead with the arming of helicopters as rapidly as possible.
                            Since the whole doctrine of using helicopters in counter-guerrilla war
                            is now under development, I think that the helicopters should be armed
                            urgently so that we can at least find out whether they won't give
                            adequate protection to American armed forces personnel without the
                            necessity of saturation bombing and strafing.</p>
                        <p>3) I was frankly concerned by General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>' presentation of the “Explosion” operation which
                            he is considering. I believe that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            would be tipped off before such an operation could possibly take place
                            and that it would give them time to make themselves scarce. I am
                            concerned that given the very large numbers and different types of armed
                            forces now operating in Viet-Nam the attempt to carry out such <pb n="695" xml:id="pg_695" facs="0715"/>an operation simultaneously
                            throughout Viet-Nam would lead to chaos and the loss of many innocent
                            lives. I fear that after it had occurred the Vietnamese armed forces
                            would be in a weakened condition and that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> could slip back into their old positions relatively
                            easily. In sum, I am dubious about such an operation and I think that
                            its political implications are so important that it should not be
                            approved without full consultation with the Department of State.</p>
                        <p>4) I would like your views on whether we are doing everything possible to
                            put in administrative support in villages which have been recently
                            liberated. I realize that in areas like Zone B it is necessary to soften
                            up the Viet Cong by jabbing attacks and serial action and that you can't
                            put a team of civil administrators in the middle of a Viet Cong area
                            where they could not survive. However, I hope that every feasible effort
                            is being made to maintain the Vietnamese Government's presence after the
                            military have swept a village.</p>
                        <p>5) While I realize that progress is being made in improving the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s image, for example President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s speech at the opening
                            of the National Assembly,<note n="4" xml:id="d300fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> commented that
                                    <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s speech on October
                                1 and its reception were the “high-water marks” in an increasingly
                                successful attempt to rally Vietnam to a national mobilization.
                                (Telegram 367 from Saigon, October 1; Department of State, Central
                                Files, 751K.00/10-162)</note> I am still concerned that the Viet
                            Cong propaganda machine is more effective. In general I think that the
                            question will be solved through concrete steps taken to help the
                            villagers, while unfounded public claims by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will only hurt their cause. I approve of the many steps
                            being made to get information to the villagers through radios,
                            newspapers, etc., but I think we should make a constant effort to
                            dissuade the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> from over-optimism and
                            from overstating its case.</p>
                        <p>In general I feel that we are doing better militarily but that more must
                            be done to help the villagers themselves, not only by arming them more
                            rapidly but also socially and economically. I am aware that <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> has revolutionized its procedures,
                            greatly expanded its recruiting, and that it is fortunate in having

                            Director Brent in pushing this part of their program vigorously.
                            Nevertheless, the risks are so great that I am still concerned on this
                            question.</p>
                        <p>I want to assure you that the purpose of this letter is to determine more
                            accurately how I can carry out my job of meeting the President's
                            requirements in Viet-Nam and of supporting you on questions where I may
                            be of help in order to carry out his directives.</p>

                        <p>Dear Mr. Counselor: I have already taken much time of your Government's
                            officials, including the President, on the subject of relations with the
                            Laotian Government, and I hope you will pardon my sending you this note
                            on the subject to express once again my Government's strong hope that
                            the Government of Viet-Nam will find a way to continue diplomatic
                            relations with the Laotian Government. As undoubtedly reported to you by
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>, and as stressed
                            by me to the President, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> personally has requested a reconsideration of
                            your Government's position, in view of the stakes involved in this
                            matter, not only of direct concern to the Government of Viet-Nam but
                            also in the wider sense involving the position of the free-world
                            countries in the Laotian affair. President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> has made it plain to Minister <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> and to me that, while he can
                            guarantee nothing respecting the final outcome in Laos, the Free World
                            Signatories of the Geneva Accords have chosen a course there best
                            calculated, in his judgment, to benefit stability in Southeast Asia and
                            eventually to protect the frontiers of Viet-Nam against Viet Cong
                            infiltration. The success of this endeavor depends in great measure on
                            the solidarity of the free countries signatory to the Geneva Accords in
                            pressing by diplomatic means for the fulfillment of those Accords by the
                            Communist Bloc countries and by the Government of Laos. President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> feels that the United
                            States has the right to ask for the continued cooperation of the
                            Government of Viet-Nam in this matter. He also recognizes and
                            appreciates the fact that your Government has gone along thus far even
                            despite grave misgivings. He feels that it <pb n="697" xml:id="pg_697" facs="0717"/>would be a great mistake to break diplomatic relations
                            at this point, regardless of what the Laotian Government may do in
                            recognizing the Hanoi regime.</p>
                        <p>I would ask your consideration, therefore, of a similar case with which
                            Chancellor Adenauer was confronted, of which I am sure you are aware. As
                            you know, the Federal Republic of Germany has for years taken a stand
                            similar to yours—namely, that it will not accept two German ambassadors
                            representing the two parts of divided Germany. The United States has
                            fully supported this position. Nevertheless, there has been one single
                            exception to this policy, namely in Moscow. This exception was made by
                            the Federal Republic of Germany for overriding practical reasons and as
                            an isolated exception to a general policy. This exception has not only
                            been maintained as an isolated case, not creating a precedent, but has
                            also had practical, beneficial results for the Federal Republic of
                            Germany. I hope it has been reported to you that the United States has
                            offered to do everything it can to support your Government in confining
                            a similar exception to your rule to the single instance of Laos.</p>
                        <p>It appears that the presentation of credentials of the representative
                            from Hanoi is imminent and I therefore take the liberty of requesting a
                            prompt reconsideration of this question in the light of the factors
                            above, and in view of the repeated requests from my authorities in
                            Washington on this matter.</p>
                        <p>I am sending this letter to you inasmuch as I have not had the
                            opportunity to discuss the matter with you personally, although I have
                            done so with the President and other members of the Government.</p>
                        <p>With best wishes and regards,</p>
                        <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

                                <ref target="#d282">Document 282</ref>.</note> which listed eleven
                            questions asked by <persName corresp="#p_REE1">Ed Rice</persName> about
                            Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>These are, as you know, some (but not all) of the complex and broad
                            questions to which we are constantly seeking the answers and which we
                            are attempting to cover as completely as possible in our reporting. The
                            replies below are therefore but brief treatments of subjects which our
                            reporting deals with in more detail. They are numbered to correspond
                            with the numbers of your questions.</p>
                        <p>1. Because of the nature of a guerrilla warfare in which the enemy not
                            only mingles with the friendly or uncommitted population but is
                            frequently indistinguishable from such population in dress or manner,
                            aerial bombing and strafing present recognized problems. The Operations
                            Control Center uses the utmost care in selecting and cross-checking its
                            targets against all available intelligence and we are constantly trying
                            to refine these procedures. They are, in fact, as rigid and restrictive
                            as any enforced in any combat area. Furthermore, there is no doubt in my
                            mind that President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>, the
                            Vietnamese Air Force Commander and all others concerned are fully aware
                            of the harmful effects, political, psychological, and military, of
                            misdirected or inaccurate bombing. They are trying as hard as we to keep
                            these to the absolute minimum. As to the effect of an air stake on the
                            people in a <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>-occupied village, we can
                            assume it is not good. But so long as the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> conceal themselves among non-combatants, some of these
                            will suffer, too. On the other hand, all available intelligence shows
                            that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are being hurt by air
                            operations and that the populace is <pb n="699" xml:id="pg_699" facs="0719"/>not being driven into the communists' arms by them. So
                            far, then, aerial bombing has done considerably more good than harm and
                            the continued improvement in intelligence will further reduce the margin
                            for error. Vietnamese tactical air support of army operations and its
                            role in the relief of beleaguered hamlets have increased greatly during
                            the past year, and in such operations the danger to a non-<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> populace is greatly reduced. There are no
                            indications that napalm is resented more than the rockets, bombs, or
                            machine guns used by the Vietnamese air force in tactical operations. On
                            the general subject of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> versus civil
                            casualties see our telegram 376.<note n="3" xml:id="d302fn3">Dated

                        <p>2. In some cases the arming of hamlet militia has been delayed on the
                            grounds that the local authorities were still in the process of
                            determining the reliability of those they propose to arm, a position
                            difficult to quarrel with. The usual pattern in the case of completed
                            strategic hamlets seems to be to give the hamlet militia a small arsenal
                            consisting of shotguns and old French weapons and to improve these
                            gradually as better arms become available and the hamlet organization
                            develops. It thus happens that strategic hamlets are sometimes attacked
                            while they still have inadequate arms with which to defend themselves.
                            Two points should be noted in this connection, however:</p>
                        <p>a. An attempt is frequently made to protect insufficiently armed hamlets
                            through the assignment of civil guard or <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> personnel.</p>
                        <p>b. One of the primary <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> sources of arms
                            in the past has been weapons captured from friendly Vietnamese forces.
                            The chances of such losses occurring are, of course, increased when the
                            Personnel in question are inadequately trained or their loyalty has been
                            inadequately checked. But we know of no case where a hamlet had to show
                            its willingness to withstand a <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> attack
                            in order to become eligible for weapons. This, obviously, would be
                            nonsensical.</p>
                        <p>3. Many of <persName corresp="#p_REE1">Ed Rice</persName>'s questions are
                            phrased in terms of villages and villagers when I believe that hamlets
                            and their inhabitants are meant. To clarify, Vietnamese provinces are
                            divided into districts, which are in turn divided into villages. (In
                            some of the larger, more sparsely populated provinces there is an
                            intermediate unit called the canton.) Villages are primarily
                            administrative subdivisions of a district. Their councils are appointed,
                            usually by the district chief. Several hamlets are usually found within
                            the village area, one of which may also be the village headquarters.
                            Most of the people therefore are grouped in the hamlets, which are the
                            smallest and most numerous unit of habitation-not in the villages. There
                            has as yet been no <pb n="700" xml:id="pg_700" facs="0720"/>attempt to
                            arrange for the free election of village councils, but it is the avowed
                            goal of the strategic hamlet program to provide that each hamlet council
                            be so elected. Elections have not yet been held in all of the strategic
                            hamlets on the grounds that many are not yet ready for them. As to
                            whether they are really “free,” I can only report that balloting is
                            secret and there is a choice of candidates. Instructions to hamlet
                            cadres insist on these two elements but point out that if the cadre has
                            done his job well, the proper candidates will be elected. Despite this
                            paradox, there appears no doubt that a real thrust toward free elections
                            at the hamlet level is being felt and that perhaps as much progress in
                            this direction is currently being made as could be hoped for.</p>
                        <p>4. It is true that the poorest inhabitants are bearing the brunt of
                            unpaid work on strategic hamlet defenses. Those who are better off are
                            also called on to make their contribution but can do so by giving cash
                            or hiring someone else to do the necessary work. In defense of the
                            procedure it might be noted:</p>
                        <p>a. That most of the strategic hamlets established to date have been
                            financed without direct U.S. support and with limited means;</p>
                        <p>b. That the construction labor is a temporary contribution which does
                            result in increased protection for the inhabitant and thereby directly
                            benefits those working on the project;</p>
                        <p>c. In the case of current clear-and-hold operations and those which are
                            expected to be initiated with increasing frequency in the future, we are
                            hoping the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will provide minimal
                            remuneration for work accomplished, perhaps compensation in kind with PL
                                480<note n="4" xml:id="d302fn4">Formally entitled the Agricultural
                                Trade Development and Assistance Act, enacted July 10, 1954, P.L.
                                480 provided for the donation of U.S. agricultural surpluses to
                                friendly governments; for text see 68 Stat. 454.</note>
                            commodities.</p>
                        <p>5. The government does have an inspection service for dealing with
                            corruption, among officials in the provinces. There also exists a
                            President's “letter box” to which complaints alleging misconduct may be
                            addressed. While this machinery may not be adequate, there is evidence
                            that efforts are being made to eliminate lower and middle level abuses.
                            In the press there is a constant campaign devoted to exposing misdeeds,
                            and editorial comment calling on the people to denounce, and on the
                            government to punish, all cases of official corruption.</p>
                        <p>6. Most strategic hamlets do not involve relocation. The most common
                            practice is simply to build fences around the existing settlement. In
                            some cases those outside the perimeter are moved within, but they
                            continue to work their own land and remain within easy walking distance
                            of it. On the other hand, some combat hamlets, such as those in
                            Operation Sunrise, involve relocation. Our experience so far has <pb n="701" xml:id="pg_701" facs="0721"/>been that it was both wise and
                            necessary to move the villagers into combat hamlets in the Sunrise
                            operation, which was carried out in an area which had been held by the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. By relocating these people they
                            were brought back under <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> control, the
                            logistic support they provided the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> was
                            reduced, and they were offered a better and more secure life. On the
                            basis of this experience and similar situations in other provinces we
                            support the combat hamlet regroupment concept.</p>
                        <p>7. <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> and civil guard misbehavior is a
                            chronic problem, but here again the trend is an encouraging one.
                            Military civic action is still just getting off the ground, but the
                            concept of the good soldier as a friend of the people is being accepted.
                            Foraging in <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> areas will undoubtedly
                            continue, and there is probably little that can be done about it at this
                            time. On the other hand, outright crimes are usually punished when an
                            officer hears about them. Additional fundamental progress is primarily
                            an educational matter, and this is a slow procedure. The <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>, being the least disciplined
                            organization, most removed from regular units and most in contact with
                            the people in the hamlets, is, as you pointed out, the worst offender. I
                            personally believe their low pay is a contributing element in this
                            problem. Their 900 piasters per month salary was originally set up when
                            the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> was considered to be a part-time
                            organization. It has since clearly become an onerous, dangerous
                            full-time job. While squad and platoon leaders have recently been given
                            small increases, the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> continues to
                            bear the brunt of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> pressure, continues
                            to receive the lowest pay, and continues to have the fewest fringe
                            benefits. A problem arises in finding the necessary piasters to raise
                                <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> pay, however. As in the case of
                            hamlet labor, we are considering augmenting their compensation by PL 480
                            commodities.</p>
                        <p>8. The answer to question number 8 is contained in a number of recent
                            economic reports, particularly airgrams 134 and 140.<note n="5" xml:id="d302fn5">Airgram 134, September 13, transmitted a paper on
                                Vietnam's economic problems and suggested possible remedies.
                                (Department of State, Central Files, 851K.00/9-1362) Airgram 140,
                                September 17, transmitted a political and economic assessment of the
                                situation in Vietnam at that time. (Ibid., 751K.00/9-1762)</note> As
                            the question suggests, some basic reforms are needed. Plans are
                            currently underway to distribute large quantities of fertilizer to
                            Vietnamese farmers. The details, including the question of whether or
                            not free distribution should be made, are currently under
                            discussion.</p>
                        <p>9. I do not consider that a serious problem arises from any impression
                            that we are replacing the French in their colonial rule. This is, of
                            course, a theme on which communist propaganda has relied heavily, but it
                            may be expected that such propaganda will continue despite any action on
                            our part. It is also true that as Westerners in an Asiatic land we have
                            a physical resemblance to the French and other European colonizers.
                            There is, however, general recognition of our fundamental <pb n="702" xml:id="pg_702" facs="0722"/>differences from the former French
                            administration, namely, that we have not infringed on the sovereignty of
                            the Vietnamese government or people, that our actions are directed
                            toward assisting them, and our programs are largely carried out by the
                            Vietnamese themselves. Many of these same considerations are true with
                            respect to the question of whether the American presence here has
                            reached a counter-productive level. I believe that it is generally
                            recognized that we are here to assist. In light of the difficult
                            conditions under which both the Americans and Vietnamese are operating,
                            the evidences of faction have been remarkably slight.</p>
                        <p>10. The role of northerners in the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is
                            less a source of criticism than it was several years ago. While
                            regionalism is still very much present in the Vietnamese mentality, and
                            a native of one area is quick to make slighting generalizations about
                            those from another, the past years have had an homogenizing effect.
                            Thus, I do not think <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s
                            administration is handicapped by the use of northerners.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s alleged favoritism of
                            Catholics is more of a problem, for many actions take place which are
                            unjustified and are attributed to his own favoritism of Catholics. A
                            current source of concern in this area is a report that the Phu Yen
                            province chief, with whom we have worked exceptionally well, is to be
                            relieved because of his failure to get along with a very active Catholic
                            priest in the province.<note n="6" xml:id="d302fn6">I have just been
                                told that Maj. Dong (Phu Yen Prov. Chief) is to remain with

                                [Footnote in the source text.]</note> There are reports that many
                            officials in the government and officers in the army believe the only
                            way to get ahead is to be or become a Catholic. It may well be that the
                            alleged favoring of Catholics is based less on what the policy actually
                            is, however, than on what those involved believe it to be.</p>
                        <p>There remains the presence and insidious influence of the Can Lao in the
                            government. The Can Lao, however, seems to have lost momentum during the
                            past year or two. It is no longer the feared machinery for intrigue and
                            inquisition, for individual success or failure, that it used to be. The
                            factions within it are more divided today than they have been
                            previously. <persName corresp="#p_NDC1">Ngo Dinh</persName> Can's
                            Central Viet-Nam wing is probably even more estranged from <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName>'s Southern branch than it
                            was in the past and various favored groups outside the Can Lao have come
                            into being. The party still maintains its military groupings and
                            economic interests, however, and these undoubtedly are a source of
                            insecurity and irritation on the part of businessmen and army
                            officers.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>On Friday, October 12, I had an interesting talk with John Heble, the
                            U.S. Consul in Hue, about the situation in Central Vietnam. The Consul
                            in Hue has always gotten around the countryside much more than any other
                            US diplomatic official in Vietnam. When I prepared my paper on the
                            “Central Government and the Countryside”<note n="2" xml:id="d303fn2">See
                                    <ref target="#d249fn3">footnote 3, Document 249</ref>.</note> I
                            found the reports of Mr. Heble and his predecessor among the most useful
                            sources of information on the situation. Since his return to Washington,
                            Mr. Heble's relatively pessimistic reports on the present situation in
                            Central Vietnam have provoked a good deal of interest; Governor
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_REE1">Ed Rice</persName> have taken a personal interest
                            in them. Following are the principal points made by Mr. Heble in his
                            talk with me:</p>
                        <p>1. The situation in Central Vietnam can be characterized in general as
                            one in which the rate of deterioration of the Central Government's
                            position has been reduced but deterioration itself has not stopped.</p>
                        <pb n="704" xml:id="pg_704" facs="0724"/>
                        <p>2. In Central Vietnam the strategic hamlet program is mostly pure facade.
                            Often creation of a so-called strategic hamlet involves nothing but a
                            very inadequate fence around one-quarter of the hamlet. This in itself
                            might not be so significant since, while the hamlet fences have become
                            the symbol of the strategic hamlet program, other elements are of equal
                            or greater importance. However, in Central Vietnam the “strategic
                            hamlet” begins and ends with such a fence. There is no other effort to
                            improve the defenses of the hamlet and nothing at all to improve the
                            internal situation in the village <hi rend="italic">in connection with
                                the strategic hamlet program</hi>. In part this failure may be the
                            result of differences between brothers Can and Nhu. Can is unconvinced
                            as to the value of the strategic hamlet program. More generally,
                            however, it reflects customary defects of Vietnamese administration-its
                            basic inability to handle such a program, particularly with the speed
                            that is presently being demanded. The result is failure combined with an
                            effort to cover up failure through superficial compliance which can be
                            reported to the Central Government as full compliance.</p>
                        <p>3. The villagers in Central Vietnam can see no advantage in the strategic
                            hamlet program and they complain because work on the hamlets takes them
                            away from their fields. Province and district chiefs with whom Heble has
                            talked admit that the strategic hamlet program has had no effect
                            whatsoever on the number of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> attacks,
                            etc.</p>
                        <p>4. Can's Popular Force is in Heble's view a much more promising approach
                            to the problem of security in the hamlet and village. This program is
                            based upon the realization that the VC are much more deeply rooted in
                            the village than the Government has been willing to admit. Experience in
                            Central Vietnam suggests that about 1/3 of the males in any village are
                            likely to be active <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> collaborators. You
                            can build all the hamlet defenses you wish, but if you leave the VC
                            cadres in the village untouched you will not increase the villagers'
                            sense of security and his willingness to collaborate with the
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>5. Can recruits his Popular Force on a volunteer basis. Its members are
                            given training which is comparable to US Marine boot camp training in
                            its rigor. Members of the force are required to work all day and much of
                            the night. After a few weeks of training members are given the option of
                            leaving, of taking a somewhat easier administrative job in the Popular
                            Force, or of staying on in the military units of the force. The Popular
                            Force has a good deal of esprit and has something of the same appeal to
                            the youth possessed by the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. It offers
                            adventure and dedication to a cause.</p>
                        <p>6. After training, a Popular Force unit of 150 men is put in a village.
                            The members live with the villagers and help them in the fields, in the
                            construction of public works, etc. over a period of six months. The
                            members are strongly disciplined and behave in a proper manner toward
                            the villagers. After working all day members of the <pb n="705" xml:id="pg_705" facs="0725"/>force spend much of the night on
                            military patrols and forays against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. They use VC tactics, hitting the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> when they outnumber them or can achieve surprise and
                            retreating from the village when attacked by a stronger <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> force. Their activities create a sense of
                            gratitude on the part of villagers—a feeling that the Government is
                            interested in the village and its welfare. The Popular Force builds up
                            an intelligence net and gradually begins to get the cooperation of the
                            villagers. Even more significant, <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            cadres in the village begin to defect. (Although interrogations have
                            provided some information on the reasons for such defection, a more
                            intensive effort is going to be made by Can to determine the reasons.)
                            After six months or so, when the Popular Force feels it has rooted out
                            the VC organization, has developed the village defenses and has created
                            an intelligence net it moves on to another village. In Heble's view the
                            strategic hamlet program can make sense only if it is made an adjunct to
                            such an effort as this. At the same time he cautioned that if the
                            Popular Force concept is introduced generally in Vietnam—and there is
                            some present trend in this direction—it may not be effective in areas
                            where Can does not control it.</p>
                        <p>7. There has been a struggle between <persName corresp="#p_NDC1">Can</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> over the Popular Force.
                            Until recently <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> tightly controlled the Central Government's
                            support for the Popular Force and it was largely dependent upon local
                            resources in Central Vietnam. Recently, however, <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> has been convinced of the
                            desirability of increasing support for the Popular Force and has reduced
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>'s and <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>'s control over its finances… .</p>
                        <p>8. In Central Vietnam about the only welfare program of the Central
                            Government that reaches the villager or hamlet dweller is the program
                            for elimination of crop pests. This program, for which we supply much of
                            the support, has done an effective and important job of significantly
                            increasing crop yields. When I asked Heble what sort of welfare programs
                            he would recommend he mentioned small public works—especially roads and
                            small irrigation works.</p>
                        <p>9. A general exception to Heble's statements about the ineffectiveness of
                            Government programs was his view of the Montagnard program. The
                            Government has in recent months been doing a much more effective job
                            with the Montagnards. Nonetheless he is a little afraid that there may
                            be a gap in planning between the kind of immediate relief activity in
                            which the Government is presently engaged and its longer term
                            resettlement programs. I mentioned to him that I had had a similar
                            concern as reflected in my paper but had been assured by Bill Trueheart
                            and others that, in fact, the Government was moving beyond the immediate
                            welfare stage.</p>
                        <pb n="706" xml:id="pg_706" facs="0726"/>
                        <p>10. Mr. Heble confirmed what I have heard before with respect to
                            intelligence; namely, that while intelligence on the VC has improved as
                            a result of improved organization and efficiency of military
                            intelligence collecting system, cooperation of the villagers in
                            providing intelligence has <hi rend="italic">not</hi> significantly
                            improved. This failure is, of course, a significant indicator of the
                            inability so far of the Central Government to obtain the loyalty and
                            cooperation of the rural populace. The Popular Force program has, in the
                            limited areas where it has been developed, resulted in improved
                            intelligence from the rural population.</p>
                        <p>11. Heble emphasized the need for better training of officials,
                            particularly those in immediate contact with the rural population. The
                            rural populace rarely saw officials above the level of district chief.
                            Heble thought that a training program directed in the first instance at
                            the district chiefs would be of considerable utility. This is, of
                            course, the suggestion I made in my paper. Heble also agreed that there
                            could be real value in using visits to districts and provinces where an
                            effective job is being done as part of a training program for district
                            chiefs and others. It provided one means by which one could hope to
                            change the attitudes of district officials.</p>
                        <p>12. Heble also agreed with my conclusion that the election of hamlet
                            councils under present circumstances had little, if any, value in
                            providing a channel of communication between the Government and the
                            countryside. As long as the councils were fundamentally the instrument
                            of the central Government for the imposition of certain programs in the
                            countryside, truly free elections would be difficult to achieve and even
                            if achieved would not produce a body that could serve as a channel of
                            communication. Heble believes that the establishment of such channels of
                            communication is of considerable importance.</p>

                                relations with Laos if the North Vietnamese Ambassador presented his
                                credentials. (Ibid., 651J.51K/10-1762) Regarding telegram 331, see

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> met his visitors at the door to his office
                            and, after everyone was seated, asked Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> how the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> meeting had progressed.<note n="2" xml:id="d305fn2">Since there was no formal SEMO Council meeting in

                                York on September 29.</note> Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> answered that he thought that the meetings had been
                            successful and had been concerned principally with the refinement of the
                            latest plan. He commented that, of the four plans which had been
                            prepared up to now, three of them concerned South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> then asked the Admiral what he thought of
                            the situation in Laos. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> held up his crossed fingers and said that we must
                            hope for the best. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> explained that crossed fingers meant, in
                            Vietnam, “nothing doing”. The Ambassador then said that the Phoumi
                            charges concerning the locations of North Vietnamese Communist units had
                            been delivered to the International Control Commission. He added that
                            the forces which were working in Laos appeared to be driving Phouma more
                            to the right. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName>
                            agreed, and said, in confidence, that that very morning the Pathet Lao
                            had launched attacks in direct violation of the Geneva Agreements. He
                            could not, he said, understand what their interest could be in doing
                            this. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> agreed
                            that it was difficult to understand what they could gain by such
                            violations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> stated that these actions could
                            be the result of the fact that there were many factions, many
                            “tendances” within the Communist element. The Ambassador commented that
                            there was not much coordination between the factions. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> then volunteered his personal opinion that
                            the two North Vietnamese regiments which were in Laos did not want to
                            return to Hanoi. They wanted to come to South Vietnam—which was contrary
                            to the desires of their leaders in the North. He then said that last
                            year, there had been a meeting in Hanoi which had been presided over by
                            the Chinese. At the meeting zones had been assigned within South East
                            Asia—including Vietnam, Malaya, Thailand, Burma and Cambodia in
                            connection with the settlement of the Laotian question. North Vietnam's
                            task was to provide two regiments which would operate in the South.
                            Since that time, authorities in Hanoi had decided to replace the two
                            regiments in South Vietnam by two regiments which were more reliable and
                            the two units originally assigned to South Vietnam were ordered to the
                            area surrounding Saravane. This action created doubts within the two
                            regiments which had been reassigned and their morale was affected by the
                            knowledge that they were not trusted. They had sent emissaries to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> with the request that he take a strong
                            position against neutralism in Laos—since the realization of this state
                            would result in their forced return to North Vietnam—which they did not
                            want.</p>
                        <pb n="709" xml:id="pg_709" facs="0729"/>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> then asked what
                            the monthly rate of defection was. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said
                            that he did not know but that it was increasing because of the growth in
                            the number of strategic hamlets. He went on to say that the defection of
                            officers remained a question of the individual and that the surrender of
                            entire units still remained in the contact-negotiation phase. He then
                            told the story of how, in Khien Phong Province, a leader—Colonel—of the
                            Viet Cong had been seriously wounded during an offensive operation
                            carried out by government forces. A check of the serial numbers of this
                            officer's pistol (which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> produced and showed
                            to his visitors) revealed that the wounded man was a person who had been
                            favorable to the government. Generally, said Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>, the dissatisfied Viet Cong troops wanted
                            no part of neutrality in Laos. One of their leaders, a General, had
                            attended a number of meetings held by the Communist chiefs and had
                            reported that one must not believe that the Communists really wanted a
                            neutral Laos. He had added that the creation of the present government
                            in Laos had served to demoralize the factions in the North who were
                            opposed to the Communist regime. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> then asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> if he
                            thought that there were many malcontents in the North. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> replied that, although the number of people
                            who were opposed to the Communist government was important, they were
                            not properly organized. Reverting to his discussion of the two regiments
                            he said that some of the troops were willing to return to North Vietnam,
                            but most of them would rather return to the South. He added that a
                            peculiar problem had been raised by the possibility of the Russians'
                            refusal to supply the Communist regiments in Laos. If this occurred
                            Hanoi would be forced to take care of them. Meanwhile, the effect of
                            this problem was felt in Zone “D”. It had been planned that this area
                            would be stocked in a manner to provide for the needs of a division.
                            Recently, however, the plan had been upset. Operations carried out by
                            forces of the Government of South Vietnam had resulted in the loss of
                            one-third of these supplies. Another third had been stolen to meet the
                            needs of the two regiments in Laos. This was why it was necessary,
                            concluded Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>, for the government to launch an
                            operation which would result in the seizure of the remaining stocks,
                            leaving the projected <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> division hungry.
                            In reply to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>'s
                            question, he said that he did not believe that the effective of a
                            complete division were actually in Zone “D”.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> then said that he believed that the doctrine
                            of Mao Tse Tung contained a basic fallacy. According to Mao there was a
                            natural progression from guerrilla activity—through irregular forces to
                            conventional warfare. The fallacy became evident when the Viet Cong
                            tried to progress to the stage of irregular forces and found that they
                            did not have popular support. This was the reason for their many recent
                            failures, to which mobility of regular government forces and improved
                                <pb n="710" xml:id="pg_710" facs="0730"/>counter-guerrilla tactics
                            had contributed a great deal. He ended this part of his statement by
                            saying that there was a direct connection between the events in Laos and
                            the Viet Cong plans for Zone “D”, adding that the Geneva solution of the
                            Laotian problem had caused much hesitancy among the Viet Cong forces
                            which had been sent to Saravane.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> then asked Mr.
                                <hi rend="italic">Nhu</hi> for a clarification of what he had said.
                            Did he mean, asked the Ambassador, that the continuation of Pathet Lao
                            control on the borders of South Vietnam was an encouragement for the
                            defection of Viet Cong troops and an advantage for the side of the
                            Government of South Vietnam. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> answered that
                            he thought that it could be—if we could inspire confidence in the
                            defectors. He said that he had met with their spokesmen twice, only, but
                            that they had spoken at length with their old friends now in the South.
                            Many of them, he felt, were serious minded men. Eight or nine months ago
                            they were worried about the results of the Geneva Conferences. From the
                            standpoint of basic doctrine, as well as that of strategy, they were
                            opposed to neutrality—recognizing it as merely a step toward communism.
                            When Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> pointed
                            out that these people continued to fight on the side of the Communists,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said that their approach to him was with
                            the objective of finding out what the government had to offer. They saw
                            the American approval of neutralism in Laos and an aberration—and
                            asked—“if they fought for real freedom, who could they count on to fight
                            along side them?” When Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> insisted that, in Vietnam, there was no question
                            of neutralism, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> answered that he believed
                            this, but that others asked, in view of Laos, where the United States
                            policy would stop. He then went on to say that there was a decalage—an
                            echelonment in time between the psychology of the United States and that
                            of the under-developed countries of Southeast Asia and the captive
                            nations of Europe. This, he said, was the greatest worry of those who
                            were hesitant about which cause they should support. The second reason,
                            he added, was himself. The concept of the strategic hamlets had been
                            accepted as a stroke of genius. But, people said, you, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> are an intellectual and you have tended to
                            surround yourself with intellectuals who are incapable of realistic
                            action. This is a cause for their hesitancy now—and later. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> then made reference to the Dulles
                            policy—which he said was still being applied to Southeast Asia. He said
                            that the Dulles concept, which he described as a concept of a personal
                            universe, was better understood outside America—particularly in the
                            under-developed countries of Southeast Asia and the captive countries of
                            Europe. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> then
                            protested that the world picture of the Dulles policy was wrong—an
                            illusion. He said that Dulles was a firm man—that he was credited with
                            having said that “there was no morality in neutralism” but. <pb n="711" xml:id="pg_711" facs="0731"/>insisted the Ambassador, the basic
                            policy expounded by Mr. Dulles was the same as that of the present
                            administration. He added that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, as well as Mr. Dulles and before him Mr. Acheson
                            and he, himself, saw things alike. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> replied
                            that, perhaps there was an illusion—an optical illusion—but he felt that
                            dealing with neutralism was dealing from a position of guilt. He said
                            that he had the impression that the government in Washington was above
                            prejudice. When it dealt with under-developed countries or the captive
                            countries of Europe it was, in a sense, like the dealings of Russia with
                            Albania. Once again he used the word “decalage”, (an echelonment in
                            time) to explain that the continuation of the Dulles policy vis-à-vis
                            the nations of Southeast Asia was similar to the Russian, or <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>, policy vis-à-vis Communist
                            China—still considered to be operating under the policies outlined by
                            Stalin. This, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> went on to explain, was one
                            of the reasons for the misunderstanding over the settlement in Laos. It
                            has caused hesitancy on the part of the anti-Communists in the North.
                            Vietnam, he reminded his guests, has been at war for twenty three years.
                            It cannot afford to settle for an intellectual ideal. To be objective
                            equals folly. For the past six months, he emphasized, the war has been
                            intense. The people have been convinced that they have been fighting for
                            a just cause—one worth dying for. Now they are told that they must die
                            for half this cause. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> asked, at this point, what we could do. Given
                            the fact, he said, that there is an agreement which we are committed to
                            uphold, what could be done to reaffirm our resolution? Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> replied that Washington should realize that
                            they must not let go of the prey to grasp the shadow. South Vietnam is
                            at war, he said, she must not be sacrificed for the shadow of Laos and
                            Cambodia. When the Ambassador said that the United States had no
                            intention of doing this, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> insisted that the
                            position of South Vietnam had been weakened in favor of an overall
                            policy for Southeast Asia—which exists, he added, only because of the
                            solid spiritual and political strength of Vietnam. He then said that the
                            policy of the Communists should be emulated. They had worked toward the
                            consolidation of the North—and the spread of revolution in the South. We
                            should reverse this by consolidating the South and spreading revolution
                            to the North. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>
                            suggested that the word “magnetize” be substituted for the word
                            revolution. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> agreed, with the proviso that
                            the effort be a solid one. The thinking in Washington, he thought, was
                            somewhat abstract—adding that he could ask for nothing better than to be
                            mistaken. He went on to say that Vietnam certainly did not want to
                            precipitate clashes. He then referred to <pb n="712" xml:id="pg_712" facs="0732"/>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>'s
                            written account of the Yalta Agreements pointing out that these
                            agreements rested on the signature and the word of Stalin.<note n="3" xml:id="d305fn3">Presumably <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> is referring to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>'s account of his
                                discussion with Stalin in <hi rend="italic">Peace with Russia?</hi>
                                (New York, 1959), pp. 163-164.</note> He quoted <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>'s question in which he asked
                            Stalin why he had not lived up to the agreements—and Stalin's answer
                            that the conditions which had made the agreements necessary no longer
                            prevailed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> then said that the events in
                            Laos were the direct consequence of the Vienna discussions between
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>.<note n="4" xml:id="d305fn4">Reference is to the Vienna meeting, June 3-4, 1961.</note>
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> reminded him
                            that at the time of the Vienna meeting, some twenty months ago, the
                            Communists were doing very well in Laos and conditions there were in
                            their favor. Also, he added, the tension which existed in Laos was not
                            the same as that which prevailed at Yalta. In Laos, the Communists had
                            created the tension themselves and were free to lift it whenever they
                            chose to do so. He then asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> if he thought
                            that <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> wanted real
                            neutrality in Laos. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> replied that the
                            actions of the countries of the Free World were such that the initiative
                            was always left with the Communists. The “agreements” in Laos were
                            entirely dependent upon the will of <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>. Why, he said, can't we provoke an
                            anti-Communist movement through our own initiative? When Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> referred to the
                            present policy of the United States, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>
                            retorted that Americans, ideologically, think that governments really
                            govern. Passing over Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>'s remark that this was true in the United
                            States, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said that, in under-developed
                            countries control of the people had to be established at hamlet level.
                            How, he asked, could Phouma or Phoumi hope to do this? In Vietnam, he
                            added, the government in Saigon could be changed 36 times and the people
                            would never know it. We must think seriously, he said, of organizing the
                            villages in Laos—and in Thailand. If the villages are not held, there is
                            no hope of stopping Communist progress. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> then said that <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Phouma</persName> had expressed his intention to
                            travel extensively throughout the country. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>
                            retorted that President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> had
                            been traveling throughout Vietnam for eight years. He was adored by the
                            population, but there still remained the question of organizing the
                            masses. For this, he added, there must be a revolution. In Thailand and
                            Cambodia this was equally true. In Thailand the great difficulty lay in
                            the fact that two revolutions would be necessary. There, the Army and
                            the police constitute two separate forces. Reorganization of the
                            villages would involve paramilitary forces—the police—and consequently
                            the Ministry of the Interior. The Army, of course, would not approve and
                            there would consequently have to be two revolutions—one at the
                            summit—and the other in the villages. <pb n="713" xml:id="pg_713" facs="0733"/>In Laos too, added Mr. Nhu, there would have to be a
                            revolution and if this revolution is not better than the one which the
                            Pathet Lao have to offer, the country will be lost. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> at this point commented that,
                            when <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Phouma</persName> visited
                                Washington<note n="5" xml:id="d305fn5">Laotian Prime Minister
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna Phouma</persName> visited
                                the United States, July 27-30.</note> he was asked his views on
                            social and economic reform. The general impression gathered from his
                            answers was that he had a good fundamental program. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> interjected the facetious remark that
                                <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Phouma</persName> had promised such
                            things as hospitals and schools. The Ambassador insisted that Washington
                            was convinced that <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Phouma</persName> had
                            ideas which went deeper and that he was genuinely interested in reform.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> commented that reform was not enough—there
                            had to be a real revolution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> next said that he had discussed some of his
                            theories with an American journalist. This man had told him that if he
                            really carried them out he was working toward his own destruction.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>'s answer to him was that “unless the seed
                            die, there can be no new harvest”. He then, once again, spoke of the
                            “decalage” or time gap in Washington thinking. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> admitted that there was a
                            tendency on the part of Americans to think of governments doing what
                            they say they will do vis-a-vis the people. Still, he added, responsible
                            people in the United States Government were beginning to understand more
                            and more what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> had said about the need to
                            win over the people at the basic hamlet level. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> agreed that this was good but insisted that
                            the need for social revolution in under-developed countries should be
                            appreciated. Cambodia, he said, was a country in which this was not
                            realized. <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> wanted no part
                            of agricultural reform or of any other revolutionary move. He was
                            content to hide behind the “alibi” of nationalism. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> commented that this was
                            somewhat like the <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            government in Indonesia. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> then went on to
                            say that in 1945, the need for revolution was not appreciated. When he
                            had said to the French Commander, during the period of Japanese
                            occupation, that it was time to do something about reform and
                            independence, the Admiral had said, “Yes—after we have achieved
                            victory”. It was useless to tell him that, without reforms, there would
                            be no victory. The need in all the Southeast Asian countries was for an
                            economic and social revolution. Governments could not prevail unless
                            they themselves carried out this revolution.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> then reminded
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> that he had continuously expressed the hope
                            that South Vietnam would keep its representation in Laos. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said that there would still be a South
                            Vietnam presence in Laos, though, he added in response to Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName>'s question, there
                            would be no Embassy. Perhaps, he said, there would be Consulates—and by
                            his manner implied that there would be <pb n="714" xml:id="pg_714" facs="0734"/>other forms of presence. He then said, somewhat
                            lightly, that the Laotian Embassy would remain in Saigon—though the only
                            time they had anything to say was when they wanted money or something
                            else. He once again mentioned the differential in the thinking in
                            Washington and in Vietnam. He said that he was not against the basic
                            Washington policy but that his objection to it was one of degree and
                            form. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>
                            suggested that there might be some difference of perspective—to which
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> replied that South Vietnam, not having the
                            means of the United States, could not afford this basic policy.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> then said
                            that if there was any doubt in the minds of the people of Vietnam, or
                            amongst the Viet Cong who wanted to return to the side of the
                            government, a way must be found to clarify the fact that the Americans
                            are in Vietnam at the invitation of the government and that they intend
                            to continue to help until victory has been won. They would then leave.
                            Any doubt about the United States shifting its policy toward neutrality
                            must be dispelled. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said that there was no
                            fear that the Americans would remain too long—the fear was that they
                            would leave too soon—and that they would slip out through the door of
                            neutrality. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>
                            then said that Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName>,
                            who had frequent and recent contact with Washington, could attest to the
                            fact that, in Washington, there was no thought of neutrality for
                            Vietnam. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> said
                            that he had never heard the faintest whisper of such an idea. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> then said that he, personally, was
                            convinced that the United States had no idea of abandoning Vietnam, but
                            that others could not understand the reason for what had taken place in
                            Laos. Those who had the desire to confront the Communists thought that
                            Laos offered the perfect terrain for their struggle. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> made the point that there was
                            a big difference between Vietnam and Laos. In South Vietnam people were
                            willing to fight, and to die if necessary for their freedom. This had
                            not been true in Laos. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> repeated that the
                            guerrilla-minded people thought that, if ever they had to fight the
                            Chinese Communists, the ideal terrain would be Laos. Here, they said,
                            was the place to open a gigantic hemorrhage in the belly of Communist
                            China.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName>, at this point,
                            asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> what the status of the amnesty
                            program was. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said that it was now too early
                            to announce this program and that it should be proclaimed at the time of
                            the general offensive proposed by General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>.<note n="6" xml:id="d305fn6">Regarding the general offensive, see <ref target="#d277">Document 277</ref>.</note> He said that the Viet
                            Cong were preparing plans for their fall and winter campaigns—but that
                            the initiative would be taken away from them by the government. He said
                            that the recently increased government activity was preparatory to the
                            general offensive. In reply to Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName>'s question as to when this campaign would be
                            launched, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> replied <pb n="715" xml:id="pg_715" facs="0735"/>that this was a military matter to be
                            decided by the military, but that he felt that it was closely linked to
                            the Strategic Hamlet Plan which, at the first of the year, would have
                            three-quarters of the population under government control. Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> commented that, at
                            that time, the second of the two new divisions would have completed its
                            training. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> again pointed out what he
                            believed to be the great fallacy in the Mao doctrine and said that his
                            concept of the Strategic Hamlet Program had grown out of this.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> then said that he
                            was much encouraged by the attitude of the government authorities he had
                            talked to during this visit. He added that a great change for the better
                            had taken place since he first visited Vietnam some four years before.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> agreed that much progress had been made and
                            said that, in three months the problem of desertion would be solved.
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> said that he had
                            examined the desertion reports carefully and had been quite worried
                            about them. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> explained that one of the
                            principal causes of desertion had been the feeling of injustice which
                            had spread amongst conscripts who, ostensibly had been drafted for
                            eighteen months service but who had subsequently been extended
                            indefinitely. The major problem, he said, had been that if the
                            conscripts were released after. eighteen months service they would
                            return to their native villages where they would be impressed by the
                            Viet Cong. This, in effect, amounted to the government training troops
                            for the enemy. As of the first of the year, all draftees who had
                            completed thirty-six months service would automatically be released.
                            When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> repeated that there had been a
                            terrible sense of injustice amongst those who were kept beyond the
                            originally specified period, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> assured him that there was no difference between
                            their feelings and those of Americans. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> then
                            said that an impending problem would be that of taking care of the
                            defectors who would come over to the side of the government in
                            ever-increasing numbers. Smilingly he said that this was really a
                            post-war problem. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> added the comment that it was an optimistic
                            problem. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> said
                            that he kept statistics on the number of people killed in action,
                            wounded in action and captured. To this, he said, he would add a column
                            showing the number who defect to the side of the government. This, he
                            said, would become the most significant figure.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> then asked Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> what actions were being taken to solve the
                            problem of dependent housing. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> replied that
                            the problem had been placed high on the priority list of things to be
                            accomplished through the strategic hamlet plan. He said that first
                            priority in the hamlets was given to families of combatants—not only for
                            housing but in such matters as agricultural credits. Their children were
                            granted scholarships to attend schools. In reply to Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName>'s question as to what had been
                            done for the families of conscripts, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>
                            <pb n="716" xml:id="pg_716" facs="0736"/>said that these people could be
                            divided into two categories. The first of these, in the tradition of the
                            French expeditionary forces, were the camp followers. Eventually this
                            problem would be solved by the completion of the Strategic Hamlet
                            Program which would assure the security of the families and protect them
                            from the threats and reprisals of the Viet Cong. Meanwhile, a special
                            policy was required to take care of them. Not only was there need for
                            housing for them, but an organization had to be set up to train them in
                            “mobile” skills such as nursing, midwifery, hairdressing, teaching and
                            sports. With these skills, which they could take with them as they
                            followed displaced troop units, they could supplement the family budget
                            instead of whiling away their time uselessly while their men were away.
                            The presence of these families would also constitute a cordon sanitaire
                            around troop installations. The establishment of strategic hamlets would
                            provide for the second category of families. Freed of the menace of Viet
                            Cong reprisals they could remain on the family land and devote
                            themselves to productive tasks. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> insisted
                            that he should not normally be concerned with these problems which, in
                            essence, were military, but, as Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> agreed, the strategic hamlet program touched on all
                            basic problems—including that of morale.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> who, earlier,
                            had said that he would have to leave in a relatively short time in order
                            to say farewell to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_Hooten1">Hooten</persName>, the Canadian member of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>, told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> that
                            it was long past the time when he should have left, and the meeting came
                            to a close</p>

                            place upon it and the fact that we have a right to ask him as an ally to
                            cooperate in matters which so vitally affect our efforts to keep South
                            Viet-Nam free. This is also true of Cambodia where <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is continuing to aggravate situation to

                        <p>Dear Mr. President: As the Republic of Viet-Nam comes once again to
                            celebrate its establishment and its independence, the United States of
                            America sends greetings to the Vietnamese people and to their
                            government.</p>
                        <p>In writing to you on this same occasion last year,<note n="2" xml:id="d308fn2">For text, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign
                                    Policy: Current Documents, 1961</hi>, p. 1049.</note> Mr.
                            President, I paid tribute to your country's heroic struggle against the
                            campaign of terrorism, destruction and suffering by which Communism had
                            responded to the progress which your young republic had achieved. In
                            those dark days the American people joined with your compatriots in
                            looking forward to a future October twenty-sixth when Viet-Nam would
                            again know peace, and its citizens would begin to enjoy the <pb n="719" xml:id="pg_719" facs="0739"/>freedom and prosperity which Communist
                            subversion would deny them. That day is approaching. The valiant
                            struggle of the past year, the sacrifices and sorrows of countless
                            heroes and the introduction of new institutions such as the strategic
                            hamlet to bring lasting social and economic benefits to the people in
                            the countryside earn for Viet-Nam the world's admiration.</p>
                        <p>As Viet-Nam gains its victory over adversity and aggression, it will be
                            in a position increasingly to devote its energies to achieving closer
                            cooperation among the community of free Southeast Asian states. Each of
                            these nations has its unique character and philosophy. In common they
                            are confronted not only by grasping Communism but also by the chance to
                            develop together. By sharing the development of their individual
                            capacities they can multiply their mutual strength. Thus can Southeast
                            Asia become unassailable and contribute to the stability of the world
                            community. This task is as difficult as it is necessary. It will require
                            a mutual submergence of differences and bold leadership. It will call
                            upon those of vision to see a future of Asian peoples working for their
                            common benefit in a harmony and freedom bequeathed them by their
                            forefathers.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, I again express my faith and that of the American people
                            in Viet-Nam's future and I look forward with confidence to a year of
                            increased momentum and progress leading to the restoration of peace, law
                            and order, and a better life for the Vietnamese people.</p>

                            representative in Laos would not be in position to help with diplomatic
                            influence on <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> would doubtless not leave its embassy
                            in Saigon under these circumstances. I used President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>'s great and heavy
                            responsibilities involving world peace, as reflected in decision re

                            Laos. I put this to him as strongly as I could without indicating any
                            thought of withdrawal of support or infringement <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> sovereign right of decision. I asked <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> not to come to a decision
                            immediately but to think it over yet again in the light of what I had
                            said on instructions. He did not seem as adamant as previously, but did
                            say that he thought that he had gone quite far, and as far as he could
                            go, to accommodate our views. He added that he had no desire to
                            undermine the agreement on Laos, although he had little faith in its
                            outcome; but he also was determined not to undermine the will and
                            rationale of the Vietnamese people by seeming to ignore an action on

                            was seeking to conceal what was going on in Vietnam. I pointed out that
                            press reporting on Vietnam had improved markedly in recent weeks and
                            that this favorable development would be undermined by expulsion
                                <persName corresp="#p_RJ14">Robinson</persName>. I urged him to
                            accept fact that press problem would cure itself, and could only be
                            curbed, by manifest success in defeating Viet Cong. Finally, I told him
                            calmly that his rationale for action against <persName corresp="#p_RJ14">Robinson</persName> would not be understood or accepted by US
                            Government or people.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TWC2">Trueheart</persName> and I repeated these
                            and other arguments many times in course of meeting without apparent
                            effect. <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> acknowledged that
                            visa question was technicality and that action was directed against
                                <persName corresp="#p_RJ14">Robinson</persName> personally. He had
                            with him a dossier of <persName corresp="#p_RJ14">Robinson</persName>'s
                            past broadcasts and showed me one of about six months ago which was
                            highly critical of President and his family. He characterized <persName corresp="#p_RJ14">Robinson</persName>'s attitude as “intolerable”,
                            lacking in elementary respect for chief of state, referring specifically
                            to <persName corresp="#p_RJ14">Robinson</persName>'s alleged remark to
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> press <pb n="722" xml:id="pg_722" facs="0742"/>officer, after long interview with
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> some months ago, that
                            president had “taken a great deal of time saying nothing”. He referred
                            to sacrifices which he and his family have made for Vietnam over many
                            years and said that for these past actions he and his family were widely
                            respected in Vietnam. It was his duty not to permit this respect to be
                            undermined by insulting press reporting. He said several times that it
                            was also his duty to other chiefs of state not to tolerate attitude of
                            reporters like Robinson. (It was made clear that American political
                            leaders do not expect immunity from personal press attacks for
                            themselves or their families.)</p>
                        <p>This is essence of lengthy discussion in which I believe all available
                            arguments were brought to bear with great earnestness and in which basic
                            difference in points of view was clearly isolated. Fundamentally, this
                            difference is that Diem is unwilling or unable to subordinate to other
                            considerations, however important, his canons of correct behavior, and
                            what he regards as his primordial obligations to his family.
                            Accordingly, I frankly have little or no hope that <persName corresp="#p_RJ14">Robinson</persName>'s expulsion can be averted.</p>

                        <p>Feuding between <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and American newsmen,
                            for years one of unhappy facts of life in Saigon, this week appears to
                            be expanding to unprecedented and undeniably dangerous proportions.</p>
                        <p>In past Mission has been able to preserve at least semblance of order,
                            e.g. last spring when Ambassador persuaded President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> to rescind expulsion orders
                            against Homer Bigart (NY Times) and <persName corresp="#p_SF3">Francois
                                Sully</persName> (<hi rend="italic">Newsweek</hi>). When <persName corresp="#p_SF3">Sully</persName> was again ordered to leave early
                            September, however, Mission appeal was rejected. Since then, as though
                            reassured by relatively harmless reaction, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has been getting increasingly tough with press—despite
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>'s promise to <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> after Sully affair that effort would
                            now be made to improve facilities and otherwise repair relations.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Newsweek</hi> has been wholly banned from SVN

                            despite Mission representations to <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>, Tao and other senior officials. Minister Hieu
                            last week told <gloss target="#t_PAO1">PAO</gloss> ban would remain in
                            effect at least six months—though this may be softened if Kenneth
                            Crawford of Newsweek's Washington bureau, visiting for month, maintains
                            initial good impression. One-issue bans and delays of other American
                            publications, notably <hi rend="italic">Time</hi>, have become more
                            frequent.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has also advised Associated Press
                            correspondent Malcolm Browne that it intends to terminate AP contract as
                            of end of calendar 1962 to save money ($600 monthly), rotating <gloss target="#t_UPI1">UPI</gloss> and AP on yearly basis thereafter.
                            Since <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> controls AP circulation
                            through Vietnam Press, this will deny entry to Vietnam of AP news in any
                            form. (We are attempting to find way to buy service for new AFRS station
                            as possible means persuading <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to
                            reconsider.) For moment there's no hard evidence that cancellation is
                            anything more than economy, but it's considerable coincidence in view of
                            open <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> moves against US press. It also
                            comes after several Browne dispatches that irritated <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. These notably included report few
                            weeks ago of trouble between <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> and
                            US personnel; <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> officials have
                            repeatedly protested article to Mission officers.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s repeated promises to institute
                            daily military press briefings have come to naught, and project now
                            seems to be dropped, at least for moment. <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> PIO reports that the three <gloss target="#t_DGI1">DGI</gloss> officers, whom he had been training in briefing
                            techniques, have ceased coming around; PIO speculates that complexities
                            of undertaking were too much for them. Two military officers who <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> had promised to provide for similar
                            training have never materialized.</p>
                        <p>Within past few days two new restrictions were imposed: 1) prohibition on
                            newsmen riding in T-28 aircraft, and 2) prohibition on visits to Special
                            Forces units without <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> permit. Letter,
                            when newsmen discover it, is certain to stir considerable bitterness
                            because most SP operations are run by Americans, who thus are made
                            inaccessible without <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> okay.</p>

                        <p>On top of all this, GVN chose October 25, eve of Independence Day
                            celebration which was marked by public assertions of gratitude and
                            friendship with US, to order <persName corresp="#p_RJ14">James
                                Robinson</persName>, veteran Far East correspondent for <gloss target="#t_NBC1">NBC</gloss>, to leave country “within shortest

                            ordered because <persName corresp="#p_RJ14">Robinson</persName> had
                            entered <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> with transit visa and failed
                            apply for regular visa within seven day limit (which was true).</p>
                        <p>Ambassador called on <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> October
                            29 to protest and learned technicality was only ruse, that true reason
                            was “insulting” broadcast by <persName corresp="#p_RJ14">Robinson</persName> last May discussing family “clique” running
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> government. <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> also complained he had once given
                            long interview to <persName corresp="#p_RJ14">Robinson</persName> only to
                            learn subsequently that <persName corresp="#p_RJ14">Robinson</persName>
                            not only had not used story but also had remarked that it's not much of
                            a President who has that much time to “waste” on reporters. <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> flatly refused Ambassador's appeal
                            to reconsider (see <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 466),<note n="2" xml:id="d311fn2">

                        <p>Mission has considerable evidence that expulsion created unprecedented
                            divisions inside <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_DGI1">DGI</gloss> Director Phan Van Tao and his deputy
                            Dang Duc Khoi called on <gloss target="#t_PAO1">PAO</gloss> in
                            unmistakable state of emotional agitation same night <persName corresp="#p_RJ14">Robinson</persName> received order. They reported
                            that order had originated with <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh
                                Nhu</persName> and that they had spent previous hour and half trying
                            futilely to persuade him not to issue it. Tao and Khoi continued
                            thereafter to try to persuade <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> to reconsider, including strong
                            memo from Khoi to <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> yesterday,
                            all unavailingly. Khoi openly told newsmen he opposed expulsion, leaked
                            considerable details on behind-scenes maneuvers (including <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> talk with <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>), and even told <gloss target="#t_PAO1">PAO</gloss> he was disgusted to point of resigning
                            (most doubtful).</p>
                        <p> Grotesquely Tao and Khoi gave dinner evening October 27 for foreign
                            newsmen, including <persName corresp="#p_RJ14">Robinson</persName>.
                            Newsmen considered boycott but then decided to go and found guest of

                            evening being charming, turning away newsmen's complaints with quiet
                            response that they must understand conditions unusual here because
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> at war.</p>
                        <p> Newsmen sent formal mildly-worded protest to <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> in <persName corresp="#p_RJ14">Robinson</persName>'s
                            behalf October 31. Its main point was that this discrimination because
                            other journalists had also violated visa regulations. (Mission has
                            located three who are here now, though all applied after seven-day
                            deadline.) So far <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has not responded.

                            protest to <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> calling expulsion
                            “incomprehensible” and asking explanation. McAndrew also asked how long
                            ban would remain in effect. Mission has repeatedly asked us same
                            question <pb n="725" xml:id="pg_725" facs="0745"/>and received no clear

                            should not attempt return immediately. <persName corresp="#p_RJ14">Robinson</persName> today said he would try for visa about month
                            hence.</p>
                        <p> Newsmen of course are uniformly bitter, predicting if <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> gets away with <persName corresp="#p_RJ14">Robinson</persName> on top of <persName corresp="#p_SF3">Sully</persName>, still more expulsions are
                            probable. Post is inclined to agree. Affair has made clear that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> has decided he can
                            override advice of US Mission on press policy. It also has indicated
                            clearly that <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>, and presumably wife, are becoming
                            increasingly the moulders of this policy, and are doing so in bitter

                        <p>Dear Ben: The enclosed is something I almost sent off last week—but held.
                            The matter has since died down somewhat, and I would not recommend
                            issuing any such statement at this time. However, I wanted you to know
                            how I felt about the matter in principle, and I am also puzzled by the
                            lack of any reaction from Washington. I suppose our little problem was
                            completely snowed under by the Cuban crisis—right?—or was there a
                            deadlock on whether to invoke sanctions?</p>
                        <p>All the best,</p>
                        <p>Sincerely,</p>
                        <p> Fritz </p>
                        <p>P.S. This is for YOU personally—not intended to stir up any action.

                            making on-record statement along following lines, if Dept approves.</p>
                        <p>“Embassy has done everything it can on this case (<persName corresp="#p_RJ14">James Robinson</persName>, <gloss target="#t_NBC1">NBC</gloss>), short of recommending changes of US policy, which I
                            do not think desirable or justified. The Republic of Viet-Nam is a
                            sovereign country and makes its own decisions. For our part, we have
                            made quite clear to President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Ngo Dinh
                                Diem</persName> our view on this matter, which is that the
                            encouragement of a free flow of information is the best way to vindicate
                            the just cause of Free Viet-Nam and to maintain full support for it.
                            Measures of suppression or control, either directly or through a
                            technicality, are in the final analysis self-injurious.</p>
                        <p>“I hold no brief for inaccurate reporting, nor for discourtesy in any
                            form, but I believe that the best antidote to criticism is success and
                            victory, rather than press control.”</p>
                        <p>I recognize such statement will in all probability bring heavy riposte
                            from <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>-controlled sources here and may
                            cause further decline my ability to influence Diem. On other hand, to
                            let the matter go without comment (<persName corresp="#p_RJ14">Robinson</persName> has departed this afternoon) will, in my
                            judgment, increase tendency here to pursue policy of press control and
                            intimidation at expense U.S. ability to continue support this
                            effort.</p>
                        <p>We have of course been waiting for some guidance from Dept on this
                            matter, which I recognize may have been difficult under circumstances of
                            past week. Would appreciate reaction re above ASAP, with discretion to
                            use or not depending on circumstances—e.g., other pending issues, degree
                            of press interest, etc.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>1. There is considerable differences of opinion within the Executive
                            Branch as to the progress being made in the strategic hamlet strategy.
                            This is not unnatural during a period of transition, but resolution of
                            opposing views is difficult because of a paucity of information. This
                            problem is recognized in Saigon and effort is being made to get at <pb n="728" xml:id="pg_728" facs="0748"/>the true facts by better
                            administration and production of information on the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> side. In the meantime, it would be wise
                            to evaluate the incomplete information available cautiously.</p>
                        <p>2. The doubters exist in the Pentagon, as well as State and in the White
                            House in the person of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FLMV1">Forrestal</persName>. Last week, Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> called General <persName corresp="#p_KMGVH1">Krulak</persName> over for a general talk on
                            our military efforts in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> with
                            emphasis on the security aspects of the strategic hamlet strategy.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_KMGVH1">Krulak</persName> allayed
                            Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>'s uneasiness,
                            using the basic information contained in the attached draft memorandum
                            to the Secretary of Defense.<note n="2" xml:id="d314fn2">Not found. For
                                the memorandum that <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> sent to the Secretary of Defense, see <ref target="#d319">Document 319</ref>.</note> The provision of this
                            information to the Secretary of Defense, and perhaps distributed in some
                            form to other interested Departments, is probably intended by General
                                <persName corresp="#p_KMGVH1">Krulak</persName> to spread the
                            gospel and offset opposing views in Washington. This will not be easy,
                            however, because of information gaps and other factors, some of which
                            are as follows:</p>
                        <p>a. The American Consul in Hue has reported <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s brother, Bishop [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] Can,
                            is according priority to his Republican Youth Civic Action and
                            Self-Defense Program rather than the strategic hamlet program being
                            pushed from Saigon and, as a result, the strategic hamlet program s not
                            effective in its present form.<note n="3" xml:id="d314fn3">See <ref target="#d303">Document 303</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>b. While current Viet Cong actions against hamlets (kidnapping, theft,
                            murder) are direct attacks against the people, they serve the political
                            purpose of showing that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is not
                            able to protect the populace using the strategic hamlet concept. This is
                            important as the program gets underway.</p>
                        <p>c. Neither the Fiscal Year 1964 <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> nor
                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> programs provide for strategic
                            hamlet kits. This is not a serious matter at this point except to
                            indicate that administration of the strategic hamlet program is not yet
                            an efficient matter. In this particular case, there is also a dispute
                            between <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> and DOD as to division of
                            funds for such kits.</p>
                        <p>d. Information available from Saigon continues to indicate that the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> strategic hamlet program is
                            handicapped by poor implementation by province chiefs.</p>
                        <p>e. In Malaya, the requirement for reinforcement to meet Communist attacks
                            at night was met by the collection of good intelligence and by assuring
                            that villages and posts had defenses sufficient to resist attack for the
                            6-8 hours until daylight when reinforcements could be deployed. It is
                            not clear how this problem is being met in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. </p>
                        <p>3. The draft memorandum as prepared raises certain questions which
                            follow:</p>
                        <p>a. Is the additive of 300 strategic hamlets per month being applied in
                            the area of the some 2700 poorly conceived hamlets which now exist or is
                            it merely an add-on to the current total of 3353 strategic hamlets? If
                            the latter is true, the program remains seriously weak; if the former is
                            true, real efforts at improvement are in progress.</p>
                        <pb n="729" xml:id="pg_729" facs="0749"/>
                        <p>b. How many strategic hamlet kits have already been delivered? How does
                            this figure compare with the total of not more than 600 properly
                            conceived hamlets? In other words, is the number of effective hamlets
                            directly proportional to US provision of hamlet kits or does it, in
                            fact, depend to a major degree on other action by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>?</p>
                        <p>c. To be useful, figures showing attacks against strategic hamlets and
                            other villages should indicate the total targets in each category.
                            Further, there should be a breakdown of the numbers of strategic hamlets
                            attacked into those which were properly conceived and those which are
                            poorly defended.</p>
                        <p>d. There should be a statement indicating just how the US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is meeting the problem of “considerable
                            significance” concerning Viet Cong attacks at night.</p>
                        <p>4. I recommend that answers to these basic questions be sought and that a
                            specific reporting system be instituted to refine reports now made by
                            Com <gloss target="#t_USMACV1">USMACV</gloss>. At the same time, there
                            is no reason why the proposed <gloss target="#t_SACSA1">SACSA</gloss>
                            memorandum should not go forward to the Secretary of Defense as a
                            current appraisal. I would suggest adding the following paragraph to
                            assure the data is in proper perspective:</p>
                        <p>“6. Continuing assessments of the effectiveness of the strategic hamlet
                            concept requires better information than is now available. Action is
                            being undertaken to develop a broader reporting system which will become
                            the basis for future analyses of this program.”</p>
                        <p>5. If you concur with the above, I will:</p>
                        <p>a. Have the draft memorandum typed in final form, with the addition of
                            paragraph 6 and, on signature, distributed to State and to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FLMV1">Forrestal</persName>.</p>
                        <p>b. Advise <gloss target="#t_SACSA1">SACSA</gloss> of the need to develop
                            answers to the basic questions remaining, preferably through a refined,
                            continuing reporting system levied on the field.</p>

                                298</ref>.</note> As of 3 November, General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> reports that the operation
                            is still in the planning stage as amplified below; that operations will
                            be intensified in critical areas during December, January and February
                            with nationwide intensification anticipated in mid-February. The exact
                            time has not been determined.</p>
                        <p>2. The purpose of the plan is to conduct a nation-wide offensive against
                            the Viet Cong, bringing to bear the full military potential of the
                                <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>, paramilitary and citizenry
                            of South Vietnam in an integrated campaign. The plan is phased as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Planning Phase:</hi> Involves adjustments in the
                            Vietnamese command structure to streamline channels of command as well
                            as the development of a comprehensive <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> operation plan.</p>
                        <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Preparatory Phase:</hi> Includes preliminary
                            operations with the preoperational preparations. This phase is not
                            necessarily dependent upon Phase I planning but is a continuation of
                            current operations and shall proceed concurrently with and beyond the
                            planning phase.</p>
                        <p>III. <hi rend="italic">Execution Phase:</hi> Full scale coordinated
                            operations, utilizing the talents and capabilities of every loyal
                            citizen and every paramilitary organization with the regular military
                            establishment.</p>
                        <p>IV. <hi rend="italic">Follow-up and Consolidation Phase:</hi> Restoration
                            of full control by the Government of South Vietnam, banging into the
                            plan all elements of the civil government.</p>
                        <p>3. Plans for reorganization of the military command structure are being
                            finalized and have been submitted to President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> for signature which is considered
                            necessary as a legalizing procedure. President Diem informally approved
                            the over-all concept in early October.</p>
                        <p>4. Highlights of the Vietnamese reorganization include</p>
                        <pb n="731" xml:id="pg_731" facs="0751"/>
                        <p>a. Readjustment of the Joint General Staff and the creation of three
                            service component commands.</p>
                        <p>b. Creation of an Unconventional Warfare Directorate to coordinate and
                            control the efforts of special forces and irregular fighting elements of
                            the country.</p>
                        <p>c. Elimination of the Field Command Headquarters from the command
                            structure.</p>
                        <p>d. Establishment of a fourth Corps for operations exclusively in the
                            Delta region.</p>
                        <p>e. Assignment of the necessary tactical and logistic support elements for
                            each corps by attachment or in direct support.</p>
                        <p>5. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> expects the
                            reorganization to be completed by late December. Implementing plans by
                            the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> and operational planning by
                            the Corps are proceeding concurrently.</p>

                        <p>Dear Mr. President, I wish to thank you warmly for the message,<note n="2" xml:id="d316fn2">
                                <ref target="#d308">Document 308</ref>.</note> so cordial and full
                            of understanding, which you sent me for the people and Government of the
                            Republic of Vietnam on the occasion of our National Day, Oct. 26.</p>
                        <p>As we celebrate the seventh anniversary of our Republic this year, we
                            note with great satisfaction that our determination has overcome the
                            difficulties which the enemy has heaped in our way, and that our efforts
                            in the economic and social fields already bear the most promising
                            fruits, raising the hope, as you kindly pointed out, that the day is
                            approaching when the Vietnamese people finally enjoy peace, security and
                            happiness again. I deeply appreciate the fact that you made a special
                            reference to our strategic hamlets and described them as an institution
                            designed to help us rapidly attain the essential objectives of our
                            policy, which are respect for the human person, social justice and the
                            creation of true democracy.</p>
                        <pb n="732" xml:id="pg_732" facs="0752"/>
                        <p>It is hardly necessary to add that the assistance of the United States,
                            under your leadership, definitely contributed to the successes which we
                            have scored, particularly during recent months. I bow with respect to
                            the sacrifices of those American citizens who came and shared our trials
                            and hardships and sealed with their blood the brotherhood of our two
                            peoples. I want to renew here the expression of our gratefulness to
                            these noble sons of America, to their families, and to the entire
                            American people as well. Their sacrifices will not be in vain, as they
                            show that the cause which the Vietnamese people are defending is just,
                            one which deserves to be upheld by all peoples dedicated to freedom, and
                            the more so by those directly interested in the maintenance of peace and
                            stability in this part of the world.</p>
                        <p>In reaffirming the friendship of the United States of American and its
                            faith in our future, your message is not only particularly auspicious
                            but also really heartening to us.</p>

                        <p>Defoliant operations have been completed in the areas in South Vietnam
                            that you approved 9 August 1962. The technical team charged with
                            evaluating the program considers the results of the spray operations as
                            excellent. The effectiveness of herbicides against the types of
                            vegetation sprayed in previous operations is evaluated by General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> as follows:</p>
                        <p>Mangrove forest—90-95% effective</p>
                        <p>Evergreen forest—60% effective</p>
                        <p>Tropical scrub—60% effective</p>
                        <pb n="733" xml:id="pg_733" facs="0753"/>
                        <p>The operation conducted in the Bien Hoa Air Base area during July has
                            increased horizontal visibility from approximately 5 feet to 30-50 feet
                            while improving vertical visibility by 80-90 percent. The susceptibility
                            of the sprayed areas to ambush has been significantly reduced.</p>
                        <p>United States advisors working in the vicinity of areas sprayed report
                            that there has been no apparent reaction by the populace to the spray
                            operations. Radio Hanoi commentaries to Asia and Europe, 13, 14, and 16
                            October, claimed that chemicals sprayed by the United States had injured

                        <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff and <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>
                            have reviewed the overall effects and operational value of defoliants in
                            South Vietnam and have recommended that general authority be granted to
                            General Harkins to plan and conduct future operations to achieve
                            specific military objectives by use of herbicides, without reference of
                            each detailed plan to Washington for approval. The authority proposed
                            would not extend to crop destruction and would be limited to field
                            decision concerning operations to clear grass, weeds, and brush around
                            depots, airfields, and other fixed installations; to clear fields of
                            fire to inhibit surprise attack by the Viet Cong; and, in conjunction
                            with military field operations, to spray defoliants in areas wherein
                            attainment of a military objective would be significantly eased. Plans
                            and arrangements for each operation would be reviewed and approved both
                            by the United States Ambassador to Vietnam and by the Commander of the
                            United States Military Assistance Command, Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile the Joint Chiefs of Staff have also received field
                            recommendations for extension of the defoliant operations which you
                            approved in August to five additional specific areas. The five
                            recommended areas, shown on the attached map, are examples of the type
                            of operations that we propose be conducted in the future on the
                            authority of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>
                            and General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>. They are
                            segments of highways 1, 13, and 14, a rail line and a power line, each
                            located in an area regularly harassed by the Viet Cong. The military
                            objectives sought in defoliating these five areas are improved
                            visibility and reduced susceptibility to Viet Cong ambush.</p>
                        <p>Specific psychological warfare precautions taken in previous defoliant
                            operations would be applied as appropriate for these and all future
                            operations involving use of herbicides. These measures include
                            loudspeaker warnings, dropping of leaflets, discrimination to avoid
                            damage to cultivated and inhabited areas, and avoidance of areas near
                            the Laotian or Cambodian borders.</p>
                        <p>I recommend that employment of herbicides be authorized in the five
                            specific areas shown on the attached map<note n="2" xml:id="d317fn2">Not

                            destruction to achieve specific military objectives in South Vietnam.

                            firmness with which you acted vis-à-vis the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. He felt that the Embassy had done what it could and I

                            from the Governor or anyone else about invoking sanctions. </p>
                        <p>On the other hand the Governor feels as strongly as ever that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is making a serious mistake in its
                            handling of the foreign press. The second and third sentences in the

                            think the expulsion of <persName corresp="#p_SF3">Sully</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_RJ14">Robinson</persName> have been at least
                            partially swallowed by the journalistic profession on the grounds that
                            they are not perhaps among the more outstanding members of the Fourth
                            Estate. Although the enclosed editorial from the <hi rend="italic">New
                                York Times</hi>
                            <note n="5" xml:id="d318fn5">Not printed. It was <hi rend="italic">The

                            a continuing journalistic thundering, the cases of <persName corresp="#p_SF3">Sully</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RJ14">Robinson</persName> are certainly not developing into cause celebre
                            here.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps the banning of <hi rend="italic">Newsweek</hi> and the continued
                            sporadic suppression of other American periodicals will have a more
                            galling long-run effect and, I must say, seem inexcusable in American
                            eyes. These are international publications which only very occasionally
                            refer to Viet-Nam. Whereas an individual correspondent's behavior might
                            provide some grounds for “handing him his passport”, the suppression of
                            one of the Free World's leading news periodicals seems a bit childish.
                            Do you think anything might be done?</p>
                        <p>Evidently the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> think they have our
                            number on this press question and can do as they wish. I can thus
                            understand your temptation to make a public declaration. Should we
                            perhaps have one or two plans up our sleeves in case they should try
                            another fast one?</p>
                        <p>1. As you know, the Governor has very good relations with the upper brass
                            of the journalistic world and has recently said that he is always
                            prepared to have a word with them. By this he meant that if you see
                            storm clouds gathering around a particular journalist or publication he
                            might help m explaining the Vietnamese point of view here to the owner
                            or Publisher concerned. He would, of course, only undertake this if the
                            Vietnamese view could be presented as making sense in American eyes.</p>
                        <p>2. Might it be wise to let the GVN know now that if they intend to “fire”
                            another correspondent, it may be necessary for you in Saigon or for the
                            Department here to make a public statement, calmly but clearly setting
                            forth our disagreement?</p>
                        <p>3. As to sanctions, while the Governor has said he did not wish to invoke
                            them, we have not studied the question here. Would we be prepared to cut
                            off any <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> or Psywar services to the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> which would embarrass them
                            without hurting the war effort? I imagine we should not cut off services
                            to the provinces, but we might seriously consider whether we should
                            reduce our support of cultural activities in Saigon if the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> should take another swipe at the
                            freedom of the U.S. press.</p>
                        <p>Certainly the main point that the Vietnamese should understand is the one
                            expressed so clearly by the President to <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>, when the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            begins to do better in the war, its public image will take care of
                            itself.</p>
                        <p>Good luck with your numerous visitors and may you have a quiet Christmas

                        <p>1. Although the Government of Vietnam publicly announced support of the
                            Strategic Hamlet Program in February 1962, a national plan was not
                            formally approved by the Government until early August. In the interim,
                            the strategic hamlet idea expanded rapidly throughout the country, as a
                            form of inter-province competition, with little planning and less
                            coordination. Numbers appeared to be the prime objective. Many hamlets
                            were improperly constructed and inadequately defended, and little
                            attention was given to the psychological, sociological and economic
                            preparation of the populace, or to the proper qualification of
                            administrative personnel, with the result that a basically sound idea
                            got off to a weak start.</p>
                        <p>2. Now, the Government of Vietnam's Strategic Hamlet Priority Program,
                            and the related implementing documents, include measures designed to
                            overcome the deficiencies inherent in the initial poorly-coordinated
                            program, and there is evidence of limited progress.</p>
                        <p>3. There are now 10,971 localities designated for development as
                            strategic hamlets, of which 3353 are reported as completed. These vary
                            widely in quality, as to the nature of their defenses, the composition
                            of related security forces, and as to the efficiency, competence and
                            dependability of administrative personnel. Of the entire number,
                            probably not more than 600 can be viewed as fulfilling the desired
                            characteristics in terms of equipment, defensive works, security forces
                            and, possibly most important, government.</p>
                        <pb n="737" xml:id="pg_737" facs="0757"/>
                        <p>The number of properly conceived hamlets is now growing at the rate of
                            about 300 per month. There are some 1,897 strategic hamlet kits provided
                            in the current <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> programs; over 1,200 village radios are
                            now installed, and installation of hamlet radios is now beginning at the
                            rate of 1,000 per month.</p>
                        <p>Kindred to this is the growth in quality of the Self Defense Corps, Civil
                            Guard and Civilian Irregular Defense Groups, all of which contribute in
                            some measure to hamlet security.</p>
                        <p>Thus it will be seen that the real strength of the program is still more
                            in prospect than in reality. It is only now beginning to be felt, and
                            the statistics with which we have been working to date are not an
                            accurate measure of the durability of the true strategic hamlet but,
                            more accurately, are a reflection of operations of the Viet Cong against
                            all rural localities.</p>
                        <p>4. The enclosures present the recent situation graphically. Tab A<note n="2" xml:id="d319fn2">None of the tabs is printed.</note> shows the
                            number of attacks on strategic hamlets and other, less secure,
                            localities in the past three months. “Attacks” are characterized as
                            destruction of defenses, assassination of hamlet officials, kidnapping
                            and theft of foodstuffs (Tab B). Strategic hamlets sustained an average
                            of five attacks per week, while other localities were attacked nine
                            times weekly. In the three month period covered about two per cent of
                            hamlets of all types were attacked. Two strategic hamlets were overrun;
                            nine of the less secure localities suffered that fate. The remainder
                            varied from serious depredations in the hamlet, to outright defeat of
                            the Viet Cong, to a stand-off, where both sides lost resources and
                            interest.</p>
                        <p>In terms of size, six attacks against strategic hamlets exceeded platoon
                            size while twenty-five attacks of platoon or larger composition were
                            reported against the other localities. (Tab C)</p>
                        <p>It is further of interest to note, in terms of VC tactics, that about
                            eighty per cent (Tab D) of all attacks occurred during hours of
                            darkness. This assumes considerable significance when contemplating
                            reaction time and the use of vehicles or aircraft for reinforcement or
                            support.</p>
                        <p>In geographic terms, Tab E portrays the areas in which the attacks on
                            strategic hamlets and other localities have occurred. They cover some 23
                            provinces. Of interest is the fact that during the period there were
                            only 14 attacks against the hamlets in the current <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>/US approved clear and hold operations
                            in Bin Duong, Phu Yen, Binh Dinh and Quang Ngai.</p>
                        <p>5. There would seem to be no reason for modifying the views expressed by
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> and
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> regarding the
                            long-term virtues of the program. It is only now commencing to mature
                                <pb n="738" xml:id="pg_738" facs="0758"/>and the vigorous reactions
                            against it—both reported and forecast—suggest that the Viet Cong also
                            perceive its potential. Certainly the current Viet Cong actions with
                            respect to hamlets, involving terrorism, theft, murder and kidnapping
                            are direct attacks against the people. In this sense they are
                            inconsistent with the avowed communist principle that the affection and
                            confidence of the populace are essential to their program. </p>

                        <p>Dear Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>: I thank
                            you for your letter of October 12<note n="2" xml:id="d320fn2">
                                <ref target="#d300">Document 300</ref>.</note> on the dangers of
                            over-optimism here and on other matters basic to our operation. Your
                            thoughts were most welcome, and, had we not had unfortunate difficulties
                            relating to Laotian recognition, press problems and border incidents to
                            try to deal with, I would have answered it earlier.</p>
                        <p>I agree with you that over-optimism is dangerous. I find it difficult at
                            times to be optimistic at all, in face of setbacks, non-activation or
                            poor execution of plans, dissensions among the Vietnamese, and a general
                            stickiness which pervades this place. But, as General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> put it the other day, we
                            must “whistle while we work”, for the sake of our own and everyone
                            else's morale here. And we are making progress.</p>
                        <p>Your inquiry whether the, villagers are being armed fast enough seems to
                            imply that there might not be enough small arms in Viet-Nam to give out
                            rapidly. That is not the case. Supplies of shotguns, carbines,
                            Springfields, grenades and other weapons are more than ample. There are,
                            however, two problems. First, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            and local authorities have been reluctant to issue arms to village
                            youths or militia before they have been thoroughly screened and given
                            some <pb n="739" xml:id="pg_739" facs="0759"/>training. This slows up
                            the process, though for reasons we cannot really challenge. Second, it
                            is <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName>'s fear that too
                            many arms in a strategic hamlet will make them targets for <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> supply operations. He advocates,
                            therefore, that the number of arms in a hamlet be limited to about a
                            dozen and that if the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> attack in
                            numbers too large to be resisted by the hamlet's defenders, they hide
                            their arms and disperse. We have not followed this concept, however, and
                            in the plans we are now supporting there is provision for equipping two
                            and in some cases three squads (of about 12 men each) of hamlet militia
                            depending on size and location of the hamlet.</p>
                        <p>The question about arming helicopters and using them on escort missions
                            is being taken care of. As you know, there is now a squadron of HU-1A's
                            here. Each carries a sizeable quantity of rockets and two machine guns,
                            and they have been very busy and effective lately.</p>
                        <p>I had previously talked on several occasions with General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>, along the lines of your
                            misgivings about the “explosion” scheme. He assumes the VC will know in
                            general what is up, but he does not expect them to be able to cope with
                            it. He expects them in many cases to conceal themselves, a standard
                            tactic, but to be unable to operate as effectively during and after the
                            operation as before, because in the meantime the strategic hamlet and
                            the clear-and-hold programs would go forward and forces would be
                            developed to secure the area more permanently. Further, the “explosion”
                            scheme is not conceived as a one-shot operation but rather as a series
                            of measures designed to place <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> in
                            a more aggressive posture throughout the country and to show the
                            fence-sitters who has the power. I am not completely convinced of the
                            soundness of the concept, nor of its feasibility. But I can frankly
                            think of no better way to test this government's will to bring this
                            struggle to a show-down, and this, I think, is becoming psychologically
                            necessary, particularly as regards the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> armed forces. I share your concern about the need to
                            protect the innocent from injury during military operations insofar as
                            possible, and I can assure you that General Harkins does also.</p>
                        <p>Administrative support of former <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            villages is a problem which grows in proportion to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s success. Until our first province
                            rehabilitation operations got started, there was little retaking and
                            little rehabilitation. However, in Binh Duong, where Sunrise is going
                            on, and in Phu Yen's operation Sea Swallow, villages have been retaken
                            from the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, and in these administrative
                            support and institutions have been installed. This will continue as the
                            comprehensive strategic hamlet programs we are beginning to support in
                            the delta areas. All hamlets, even those formerly dominated by the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, seem to get the same general
                            treatment. The controls in the latter may be a little stronger and last
                            longer, but the plan is that ultimately they, too, will have their own
                            hamlet councils and defense forces. And, we will try very hard to <pb n="740" xml:id="pg_740" facs="0760"/>insure that they, too, receive
                            the dispensaries, wells, schools, etc. that are part of our support
                            program and a necessary follow-up to military operations. There is of
                            course a continuing lack of trained administrators and civic action
                            specialists.</p>
                        <p>Your comments on the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s image and the
                            need for concrete accomplishments instead of empty claims are well
                            taken. We are aware of this problem which, in fact, was discussed during
                            the last Province Rehabilitation Committee meeting. <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> psychological warfare people are increasingly involved
                            in advising on and supporting province operations. As you point out, the
                            best propaganda by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will be its
                            concrete accomplishments in the countryside.</p>
                        <p>I feel we have made considerable headway toward focusing on the social
                            and economic betterment of the villagers, particularly on the
                            organizational aspects. Joe Brent and Rufe Phillips are pushing ahead
                            rapidly and the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> appears to agree on
                            the importance of these aspects. In connection with the review of next
                            year's military budget we have been careful to retain on the civilian
                            side a sizeable amount for direct counterinsurgency operations. In
                            exploring this generally with <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> earlier this week, he recognized the importance of
                            this and of earmarking the necessary funds on the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> side. As you are aware, concrete
                            accomplishments in these areas are directly related to the degree of
                            security in a given area. While we can assure, for example, that the
                            necessary economic and civic action components are included in our
                            province rehabilitation planning, they can only take hold and develop in
                            those areas where <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> clearly exercises
                            control. As the security situation improves we should expect an
                            accelerated and cumulative effect from the economic and civic action
                            measures. We will continue to concentrate on these important areas,
                            which I agree, must go hand-in-hand with the military.</p>
                        <p>I share your view that it is safer to lean in the direction of
                            emphasizing our problems rather than our successes. After a hard winter,
                            however, it is difficult to restrain feelings and expressions of
                            exhilaration at the first signs of spring. There has been a rather
                            dramatic change in outlook among <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            (and US) officials from the extreme pessimism of a year ago. This, I
                            think, is a good thing and provides considerably more impetus toward
                            uniting and getting the job done. The mood is nevertheless still one of
                            cautious optimism and I do not believe that any of us underestimates the
                            complexity of the task ahead.</p>
                        <p>I should add that, in general, things seem to be going <hi rend="italic">internally</hi> pretty well; the <hi rend="italic">external</hi>
                            problems less well (relations with Laos, the Cambodian problem, press
                            relations, etc.). A part of our difficulty in <pb n="741" xml:id="pg_741" facs="0761"/>dealing with the latter comes precisely
                            from the increased confidence of the Government, which—they are frank
                            enough to admit—we have helped to create!</p>

                        <p>537. In talk with <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> at his
                            request November 19, following matters discussed:</p>
                        <p>1. Progress Against <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> Insurgency.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> briefed me on contents
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> documents recently captured in An
                            Lac operation. (We have copies of these, now being translated.)
                            According <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>, these documents,
                            mostly letters from <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> officers in high
                            plateau area, describe a situation of severe lack of food, medicines,
                            recruits; generally low morale, desertions, and fear of <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> attack. Asked whether this was local
                            condition around An Lac, or typical of larger area, <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said he thought it applied
                            generally to high plateau (roughly <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            Second Corps area), but this not entirely clear from captured letters.
                            He said President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>, greatly
                            encouraged by these reports, had briefed his military commanders on
                            them, stressing necessity to keep up military pressure everywhere in
                            highlands; necessity to enforce strict controls over drugs and food
                            distribution; and feasibility of attacking areas like An Lac where ARVN
                            had previously feared to go. I asked <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> whether this picture of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> demoralization did not offer just the opportunity we
                            have been looking for to start large-scale defections and surrenders by
                            a well-organized country-wide amnesty program. I suggested something
                            like Magsaysay's “all-out friendship or all-out war” program, tailored
                            to Vietnamese psychology. He said this had been again discussed and that
                            a program of this kind would be launched at Tet (late January).</p>
                        <p>2. External Relations. From discussion of above, I led into dangers to
                            Viet-Nam and to progress achieved here from too narrow and inflexible a
                            policy vis-à-vis Viet-Nam's neutral neighbors, especially Cambodia. I
                            told him again of our deep concern re RKG's threat to <pb n="742" xml:id="pg_742" facs="0762"/>invite ChiComs into Cambodia if
                            Sihanouk's fears of aggression from Viet-Nam and Thailand were not
                            calmed. I said I did not know what <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>'s
                            position on proposed neutrality statute would be (since we had not seen
                            text), but that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> ought to be as
                            concerned to find a way out of dilemma made by this move as we are—even
                            more so. I said I felt <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s handling of
                            the issues with Cambodia (border incidents, notes, debt settlement,
                            etc.), regardless of the rights and wrongs on specific issues, had been
                            slow, unimaginative, and inept. If in fact their aim was to calm
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> down and prevent his
                            pushing his demands and threats too far, they should be more skillful in
                            dealing with him. I said we were counting on <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, and specifically <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> as Min. of Defense and Acting Min. of Foreign
                            Affairs, to avoid anything which could be interpreted as hostile towards
                            Cambodia on the one hand, and to promote some constructive moves on the
                            other. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said this subject
                            was most difficult. Without contesting that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> had not been forthcoming or adept in dealing with
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>, he said this was
                            inevitable when <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s president was
                            constantly being attacked personally by <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> as a “bloody dictator,” etc. Under these
                            circumstances, he said, it was most difficult to achieve a flexible and
                            realistic policy, even though such a policy would be “smart”. I asked
                            him point-blank whether there were any grounds whatsoever for <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>'s fear that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> had designs to overthrow him or to take
                            any aggressive moves against his country. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> answered that there were no grounds whatsoever. I
                            said we continued to get from time to time reports that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> agents were plotting with Cambodian
                            dissidents, and that <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>
                            apparently believed this to be the case. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> denied that this was going on. I then stressed
                            again necessity on the military side to avoid any actions which would
                            exacerbate this situation and might lead to introduction of ChiCom
                            forces on the flank of Viet-Nam. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said he realized the importance of this and would
                            do everything possible to minimize the chances. I told him that we would
                            rely on that. Thuan said that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would
                            not enter into an international agreement on the Laos pattern with
                            Cambodia, because this would be tantamount to condemning themselves as
                            aggressors, which they are not. He said the Thai Government felt the
                            same way.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> then said that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, despite gratification over internal
                            success, continued to be deeply concerned and alarmed over developments
                            in Laos, where, he said, General <persName corresp="#p_PN3">Phoumi</persName> is bitter against the U.S. and left wing is
                            continuing to make progress among the people. He said that any reduction
                            of <persName corresp="#p_PN3">Phoumi</persName>'s forces would simply
                            mean transferring those soldiers to support Pathet Lao. He then said
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> was convinced that French
                            Government has made deliberate policy decision to try to restore French
                            influence throughout former Indo-China states through extension of
                            neutralism, with “U.S. paying the bill”. He said French are doing this
                            through <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna Phouma</persName> in <pb n="743" xml:id="pg_743" facs="0763"/>Laos and through “French
                            lawyers” and men like Charles Mayer in Cambodia. He said while <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> fully trusted U.S. intentions in
                            Vietnam, they were deeply worried by U.S. “trustfulness” of French
                            policy. I said that we are not as naive as this statement seemed to
                            imply, that perhaps we had better information on French policy than
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, whose views on this matter were
                            somewhat prejudiced.</p>
                        <p>There are good reasons to believe that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is genuinely concerned over Cambodian developments and
                            are doing their best to prevent border incidents. On the other hand, I
                            do not expect any effective soothing salve to be applied by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, nor any real dexterity in dealing with
                            this ticklish issue.</p>

                        <p>Saigon once again is full of brave talk about imminent <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> inauguration of regular press
                            briefings. Besides the assurances you received Monday from <hi rend="italic">Thuan</hi>, Counselor <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> told me
                            last week that briefings and other facilities should be instituted.
                            Colonel Smith reports that General <persName corresp="#p_NK5">Khanh</persName> has volunteered to do the briefings temporarily
                            himself. <persName corresp="#p_NK5">Khanh</persName> has even asked
                                <persName corresp="#p_SBK1">Smith</persName> for advice on creation
                            of a DOD public information office.</p>
                        <p>Unhappily we have heard this tune before, always followed by endless
                            delays. Already there is a taste of the same routine in the air. When I
                            called Dang Due Khol today to ask what comes next, in view of <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>'s promises, he replied that
                            immediate action is impossible because of “difficulties” in obtaining
                            information from the field fast enough for the newsmen. He said he would
                            speak to <persName corresp="#p_NK5">Khanh</persName> about it. <pb n="744" xml:id="pg_744" facs="0764"/>This is exactly the stall we
                            encountered on the last go-round, when we offered unsuccessfully to feed
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> information collected through
                                <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> channels.</p>
                        <p>I hope I'm wrong, but it seems to me almost certain that adequate
                            improvement, if any at all, in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            relations with the foreign press is not about to materialize. In
                            anticipation of this and in view of the fact that these relations have
                            presently reached an abysmal low, there follows a reassessment of the
                            situation, and recommendations for relatively drastic action. I hope you
                            may see fit to send a copy (attached) to General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> and that the three of us
                            and Colonel Smith may then meet to discuss it.</p>
                        <p>Reason for a reassessment, in my judgment, is the fact that it has now
                            become clear that the expulsions of <persName corresp="#p_SF3">Francois
                                Sully</persName> last summer and of Jim Robinson a few weeks later
                            were considerably more than isolated incidents. On the contrary,
                            evidence accumulates that they signaled a major change in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> press policy, and that this policy is
                            being formulated and administered by Counselor <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>,
                            uncomfortably often at the whim of his wife. In my opinion, the policy
                            is rooted in an emotional, almost irrational attitude which will prevail
                            indefinitely, regardless of what comes of the current crop of promises.
                            There is ground to doubt whether the newsmen of the US Mission can live
                            with this.</p>
                        <p>Subtly but undeniably, evidence is accumulating that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>'s attitude toward the US press reflects his
                            attitude in general toward the US Government and people. It is surely
                            significant that during my talk with him on November 19, which included
                            considerable discussion of the press, <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> made at
                            least a half dozen openly contemptuous remarks about Americans.
                            Variously he accused us of failing to “understand” communism,
                            underdeveloped countries, Asians, India and cold war realities. As
                            reported elsewhere, he capped all this with the reckless (and
                            psychotic?) remark that the US should now mount an atomic attack on
                            Peking.</p>
                        <p>If you relate this to the evidence that <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>'s
                            personal power is critically increasing, I think it may be likely that
                            press policy happens only to be one of the first of our forthcoming
                            disagreements with him. It follows that the US Mission's reaction to
                            this initial challenge quite possibly could set a pattern for future,
                            much more difficult and important problems with him.</p>
                        <p>The <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>s' influence almost certainly is the main
                            reason why the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>—despite repeated
                            promises to you, the <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> and myself—has
                            failed to date to institute a single one of the improved facilities we
                            have suggested. There is even less doubt that the Nhus have been behind
                            what amounts, contrarily, to a deliberate new campaign of <pb n="745" xml:id="pg_745" facs="0765"/>harassment. It has been applied against
                            all the newsmen, furthermore, friend and critic alike, and in a spirit
                            of bitter contempt for their protests.</p>
                        <p>There have been continued public and private recriminations against the
                            correspondents by the Vietnamese press and leaders, e.g. Mme.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TLX1">Nhu</persName>'s remark in a taped interview this morning
                            with a Mutual Broadcasting System correspondent that the American
                            correspondents here are “intoxicated by communism.” (Copy attached)<note n="2" xml:id="d322fn2">Not found.</note> American newsmen in Saigon
                            believe they are regularly tailed. They are threatened with reprisals if
                            they fail to be properly “objective” (which means friendly by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> definition), notably including recent
                            publicized letter to the AP in New York personally attacking
                            correspondent Mal Browne. The permanent ban on <hi rend="italic">Newsweek</hi> continues, as well as intermittent bans of other
                            American publications.</p>
                        <p>If there was any question whether all this was officially inspired, it
                            was removed by General Ty's circular of October 13 (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 536)<note n="3" xml:id="d322fn3">Telegram 536, November 21, reported that reporters were required to
                                submit their questions to field commanders in writing. (Department
                                of State, Central Files, 951K.6211/11-2162)</note> requiring field
                            unit commanders to talk to correspondents only through written questions
                            and answers—which of course amounts to a ban on talking to journalists
                            at all if literally enforced. We have not been able to confirm the
                            origin of the Ty circular, but several newsmen claim to have information
                            that it was suggested by the Palace; in any case
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> endorsed the order when I asked him about
                            it last week. The order has already resulted in several newsmen being
                            kicked off American helicopters.</p>
                        <p>Hard on top of this came last week's prohibition on newsmen covering the
                            new operation in Zone D. This ruling also originated with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. Some 30 or 40 American helicopters
                            participated—which together with unit advisors meant perhaps as many as
                            150 Americans entering into combat conditions. The newsmen felt that the
                            ban on reporting this to American readers was an outrage. Inevitably
                            many of them found their own sources for information on the operation,
                            notably including Neil Sheehan of <gloss target="#t_UPI1">UPI</gloss>,
                            whose story led to a <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>
                            investigation, intensifying the newsmen's resentment. The Zone D order
                            has tended to turn the newsmen bitterly against the US Mission—to a more
                            serious degree, I think, than at any time since last winter.</p>
                        <p> Sheehan and Halberstam of the New York Times have both sent messages to
                            their New York offices urging formal complaints in Washington because of
                            the Zone D operation. Halberstam says he told his office that the <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> explanation of the ban (that the
                            operation's objectives are classified) was “an insult to the patriotism”
                            of the newsmen. <pb n="746" xml:id="pg_746" facs="0766"/>Attached is a
                            hastily written letter to you<note n="4" xml:id="d322fn4">Not
                                printed.</note> which Halberstam composed in my office and then
                            threw on my desk in disgust last Friday,<note n="5" xml:id="d322fn5">November 23.</note> remarking “you can do any damn thing you want
                            with it.” It is certainly true, as the letter notes, that Halberstam's
                            initial effort to be detached and fair to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, which indeed has been the tone of his copy, is fast
                            disappearing. The process accelerated Sunday when Halberstam went on a
                            trip with the junk forces, got what he called a first rate briefing from
                            a US Navy officer only to be told later by the same officer that the GVN
                            commander had rebuked him for giving the briefing and asked him to ask
                            Halberstam not to use it. When he got back to Saigon, Halberstam was
                            literally shaking with anger.</p>
                        <p>Our hope that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would begin getting
                            a better stateside press as it made progress with the war has been
                            fulfilled. There has been a distinct, continuing improvement, a widening
                            recognition that the GVN perhaps can win. But the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, instead of easing off its bitterness,
                            is responding with blind vindictiveness for past criticism.</p>
                        <p>I said earlier I'm not sure we can live with this. Apart from the
                            tactical problem of how to deal with <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>, I think
                            we must consider action because the issue itself has changed. We
                            reluctantly accepted the <persName corresp="#p_SF3">Sully</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_RJ14">Robinson</persName> expulsions, without
                            resorting to sanctions, on the principle that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is a sovereign country and thus has a
                            right to move against unfriendly reporters, even though this is not the
                            way we would do it. The difference now is that this time the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is deliberately harassing all foreign
                            newsmen, and, even more seriously, deliberately attempting to establish
                            a blackout on news from Vietnam other than official communiques, which
                            are notoriously unreliable, including news about activities of US
                            personnel in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The question of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> sovereignty is less
                            black and white in this case. This is not just another under-developed
                            country, or banana republic or what have you, rocking along in the usual
                            intrigue and petty chauvinism. This is 1) the scene of a confrontation
                            between East and West which could be decisive to the fate of Asia, and
                            2) an area of massive US involvement. This is not in any way meant to
                            invoke the weary argument that we're spending millions here and the US
                            thus has a “right” to special treatment by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, which in effect is to confirm the communist line that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> is a puppet, etc. The
                            point is rather that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is
                            infringing on a root American right: the right of the American people to
                            be informed of the facts on which the policies of their government are
                            based, and on the activities of US military personnel committed to
                            combat.</p>
                        <pb n="747" xml:id="pg_747" facs="0767"/>
                        <p>All this, furthermore, is apart from the fact that continued criticism of
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in the US press for trying to
                            suppress newsmen inevitably weakens the Administration's political
                            capability to maintain the present policy of support for the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>There is a certain parallel here with the problem of the American
                            correspondents who covered the Eastern Front in World War II under
                            innumerable restrictions, with one very big difference: in Vietnam, the
                            USG has the <hi rend="italic">means</hi> to correct the situation
                            unilaterally, at least partially. It is, furthermore, conceivable that
                            this could be done without a direct clash with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, i.e., without forcing a face-losing
                            showdown which could lead to serious damage to our relations in other
                            areas.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly some <hi rend="italic">recommendations</hi> which I hope you
                            and General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> will
                            consider:</p>
                        <p>1) We should cease forthwith any further efforts to change the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> policy toward the press by persuasion,
                            especially in view of <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>'s
                            categorical assurances to you yesterday, which were the most we can hope
                            for anyway. Failure of the GVN to follow through this time will surely
                            establish beyond doubt that persuasion on this highly emotional issue
                            doesn't work, and that further agitation can only exacerbate our
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>2) <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> should begin now to give regular
                            daily briefings to Western newsmen on a non-attribution basis. These in
                            general should be limited to news about activities involving US
                            personnel (which means virtually every action initiated by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>), but news of major developments
                            involving only <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> personnel should also
                            be “leaked” at the discretion of <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>.
                            It would be preferable not to advise the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> formally that such briefings have been started, thus
                            avoiding a direct question of “face.” But if and when the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> hears about them and inquires, we
                            should simply say the pressure from the US press for adequate
                            information became so intense that we could no longer resist it, and
                            that of course the briefings will be discontinued once the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> itself begins doing the job.</p>
                        <p>3) <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> should begin giving a limited
                            amount of classified information to reputable Western newsmen to give
                            them a true picture of what's going on, and then request them not to
                            publish or otherwise circulate those portions which would be damaging to
                            operational security. This could not be done to the extent that
                            correspondents were briefed during World War II because there is no
                            censorship nor juridical control over them in this situation.
                            (Censorship might be desirable here, but <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> application of it would unquestionably be so chaotic
                            and politically motivated that it's not a reasonable consideration, in
                            my opinion.) But I am completely confident that enough information could
                            be entrusted with the newsmen to win their cooperation. It would, of
                            course, be relatively simple to enforce their respect for classified
                            information by instantly barring a correspondent who violated a
                            confidence not only from the briefings but even from all American
                            installations in Vietnam. If this is feasible, I think we should call a
                            meeting of the American newsmen here to discuss how to go at it.</p>
                        <pb n="748" xml:id="pg_748" facs="0768"/>
                        <p>4) American advisors throughout the country should be instructed to
                            ignore any <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> efforts to prevent them
                            from cooperating with newsmen, to urge their Vietnamese counterparts to
                            cooperate, and to insist that space for newsmen be provided in the plans
                            of any operation involving American personnel or equipment. In
                            application, the sense of this would be: no correspondents, no choppers.
                            Again if this were done at the regional level, I think a showdown with
                            the GVN could be avoided because the local commanders would be less
                            willing to jeopardize US support by balking than would be the case in
                            Saigon.</p>
                        <p>I think we should all accept the reality that the newsmen here will
                            continue to find access to very much of the truth of what's going on,
                            regardless of what we may do. I think it is futile to try to “control”
                            them, or cut off their sources. Americans, even in the military, simply
                            don't work that way. If Sheehan's source for the Zone D story were
                            located, for example, he would find somebody else next time. Similarly
                            it seems rather pointless to me to try to prevent newsmen from obtaining
                            such classified figures as the number of helicopters in an operation.
                            Most of them find out simply by checking friends who live near Tan Son
                            Nhut and count them as they take off.</p>
                        <p>There is hope of suppressing that kind of sensitive information, however,
                            if we take the newsmen into our confidence as much as possible, i.e.,
                            honor their sense of patriotism as Halberstam puts it, and then ask them
                            on the basis of their own good sense not to use certain specified
                            items.</p>
                        <p>This kind of drastic shift in our policy vis-a-vis the press admittedly
                            risks an unpleasant time with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.
                            It would verge on application of sanctions—especially in insisting on
                            the right correspondents to go along on all operations as a condition to
                            providing the helicopters. In my opinion, however, the long-term damage,
                            if we permit the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to continue its
                            present policy of deliberate harassment, would be appreciably greater.
                            There is a good possibility, furthermore, that if the US applied this
                            new policy swiftly and decisively, yet quietly, so nobody loses face,
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would go along with it in
                            recognition, however reluctant, of the greater need for our help.</p>
                        <p>Subsequent (November 28) to typing of the foregoing, Colonel Smith
                            advises that General <persName corresp="#p_NK5">Khanh</persName>'s
                            office had called to ask <gloss target="#t_PIOMACV1">PIO/MACV</gloss> to
                            act temporarily as the outlet for <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>
                            military reports on a daily basis, pending inauguration of <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> briefings. <persName corresp="#p_NK5">Khanh</persName> then delivered to the PIO a
                            three-paragraph “bulletin” reporting on the resumption of the Zone D
                            operation on November 27. <persName corresp="#p_SBK1">Smith</persName> is
                            releasing this to newsmen in writing. <persName corresp="#p_NK5">Khanh</persName>'s office promised to deliver such bulletins daily
                            around 5 or 6 p.m. <persName corresp="#p_SBK1">Smith</persName> plans to
                            follow the same procedure of release in writing, at least for the time
                            being.</p>
                        <p>This, of course, is encouraging in the sense that Khanh is showing real
                            interest in the project. It must immediately be noted, however, that the
                            first bulletin was a day late. If this continues, the newsmen <pb n="749" xml:id="pg_749" facs="0769"/>can be expected to continue
                            tapping their own sources to get the news faster, with resulting
                            continued errors and possible security breaches. Also, the bulletin was
                            vaguely worded, omitting any indication of the size of the operation and
                            similar details that newsmen will be sure to want.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will have to go vastly beyond
                            this cautious first step if it hopes to bring about any appreciable
                            change in the situation. My recommendation that <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> should begin its own briefings forthwith perhaps
                            should now be amended to read that <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>
                            should be prepared to do this if the present GVN experiment fizzles. But
                            this does not change my opinion that <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> briefings will inevitably become necessary, nor affect
                            my other recommendations.</p>

                        <p>The party arrived at Gia Long Palace at 11:30 a.m. Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> expressed the group's pleasure

                            Hamlet program was likely to be completed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>
                            said that three years from now was the target date for complete
                            implementation of the Strategic Hamlet program. Two thirds of the
                            population will be living in Strategic Hamlets by January 1, 1963. The
                            political, social, economic, and military revolution involved in the
                            program would not be complete for three years, however. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> noted that, while
                            speed was important in implementing the program, thoroughness was also
                            essential.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_PC4">Pell</persName> asked Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> to explain the over-all Strategic Hamlet
                            concept and its long-range goals. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said the
                            concept was intended to be a positive contribution to international
                            strategy in the anti-Communist struggle. Subversion is the principal
                            Communist strategy on the international level, and Viet Nam's
                            contribution is to develop a means of countering subversion. As long as
                            the Communists are able to engage in subversive war, the free world
                            cannot negotiate with them, because the Communists will not negotiate in
                            good faith. The war here may be won militarily, but so long as the
                            Communist <pb n="751" xml:id="pg_751" facs="0771"/>Bloc retains the
                            capability of waging subversive war, any free world victories will not
                            be definite. By destroying the Communist's subversive capability, we
                            will be placing them in the strategic deadlock in which we presently
                            find ourselves.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> noted that we
                            were thus trying to turn the tables on the Communists.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> stated that neither the Communists nor the
                            free world wants a conventional war at this time. The Communists thus
                            have an element of superiority in being able to wage subversive war, and
                            it is not in their interest to negotiate. They will negotiate sincerely
                            only when they are convinced they will not win by subversion. This is
                            the perspective in which the strategic hamlet program should be
                            seen.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> noted that underdevelopment in Viet Nam has
                            three aspects: 1) a feeling of humiliation, 2) a disunity of minds,
                            resulting in contradictory forces, and 3) Communist subversion. To
                            combat the problem of underdevelopment there are two great historical
                            forces, one tending toward centralization, the other toward
                            fragmentation.</p>
                        <p>The history of underdeveloped countries in the last fifteen years shows
                            that the tendency toward concentration and centralization has
                            predominated. All governments in underdeveloped countries that have
                            tried democracy have been overthrown and replaced by military regimes.
                            The backward nations have used only one of the great historical forces
                            presently at work, concentration. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said he
                            had developed the idea that Viet Nam could make use of both of these
                            forces, authoritarianism and democracy, to combat underdevelopment. He
                            compared these forces to positive and negative electrical currents,
                            which produce thunder, fire, and death, when not harmonized. If we can
                            harness these forces, however, we can provoke not destruction but
                            power.</p>
                        <p>The device for accomplishing this is the strategic hamlet. It attempts to
                            exploit the war in Viet Nam for progress and democracy. This is contrary
                            to history, but Viet Nam is trying to prove history wrong. Thanks to the
                            war, the peasants recognize the usefulness of the strategic hamlet in
                            providing them security. Security, however, is but one consequence of
                            the social and political revolution contained in the strategic hamlet
                            philosophy.</p>
                        <p>If there is no such revolution in Laos, Thailand or Cambodia, these
                            nations will not be able to fight Communism or to make progress. The
                            international proletariat of underdeveloped countries, and Communist
                            subversion, have upset the classical norms of economic development. A
                            more dialectical concept is needed. Most Afro-Asian countries choose
                            neutrality in order not to be subject to pressures from East or West.
                            Because of their distance from the West, they enjoy the <pb n="752" xml:id="pg_752" facs="0772"/>indulgence of the Communists, but they
                            still cannot achieve economic progress. Cambodia and Laos, for example,
                            should wage an economic social, and political revolution.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_PC4">Pell</persName> asked whether land
                            reform was necessary in Cambodia.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said that it was necessary, for each man
                            should have his own property. Viet Nam has supported land reform with
                            land development and agricultural credit programs. 87% of the population
                            in Viet Nam is rural; this is the usual ratio for underdeveloped
                            countries. However, this segment of the population enjoys only l/a of
                            the national production, and this gives rise to a feeling of injustice.
                            With the Strategic Hamlets, we hope to be able to reverse this
                            ratio.</p>
                        <p>The West pays too much attention to winning the sympathy of the
                            population, and not enough to organizing it. If the population is not
                            organized, the Communists will be able to mobilize it against the
                            government overnight. In Cambodia, for instance, the Communists could
                            foment a rebellion at will, because the population is not organized.
                            This would not be done only by political propaganda. In 1954, after the
                            Geneva Agreements, the Communists regrouped 135,000 people to North
                            Vietnam, and 10,000 of these were Cambodians. With this 10,000, they can
                            blackmail 10,000 families, and can infiltrate agents into Cambodia
                            whenever they wish. This is how the problem started in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>It is impossible to combat Communist subversion with the personal
                            popularity of the leadership. President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>, for instance, was elected by the whole people, but
                            the government is still subject to a subversive war.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> noted that the
                            President had explained this concept in theory to the group yesterday.
                            The Senator stated that the relationship between our countries is
                            excellent, but that occasionally people in the United States read about
                            difficulties with the Western, and especially the United States, press.
                            He said he was raising this question not only from a personal point of
                            view but also from a Congressional standpoint. Some things that happen
                            here create an unfavorable reaction in the United States. The Senator
                            asked whether something could not be done about this problem, bearing in
                            mind security and mutual respect, because it is a serious problem, and
                            really the only one between the two countries. He said that he was
                            asking this in the friendliest spirit.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said he was glad that Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> had raised this question, as
                            he was concerned with the problem as a part of global strategy. The free
                            world is not adapted to subversive war in all fields. The Western press,
                            especially the American press, is not adapted to <pb n="753" xml:id="pg_753" facs="0773"/>subversive war, and lags in the world
                            evolutionary process. For example, American newspaper correspondents in
                            Vietnam are very young and inexperienced</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> stated that he had seen Mr. Crawford, a
                            <hi rend="italic">Newsweek</hi> editor, recently and had talked to him in the same vein. Mr.
                            Crawford had asked him why the things he was saying were not known in
                            the United States. Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> asked if these things were new to Mr.
                            Crawford. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said that Mr. Crawford had told
                            him that he had talked to the American Embassy before he called, but
                            that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>'s remarks went far beyond anything he
                            had heard. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said he had told Mr. Crawford
                            that he understood it was difficult for the United States press to send
                            high level correspondents to Viet Nam. However, newsmen must meet
                            minimum standards of intellect and of emotion in order to grasp the
                            problems in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Vietnam, in addition to Communist infiltration, there
                            exists infiltration from other countries who have interests contrary to
                            those of Vietnam. Vietnam is a former colony, and a certain class of
                            people were left behind after independence who remained attached to
                            colonialism. This class has lost its privileges as the go between for
                            the colonialists and the Vietnamese people. As former landowners, they
                            are the victims of agrarian reform, and therefore discontent. Because
                            they know how to speak foreign languages, they find it possible to
                            communicate with foreigners.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador explained that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> was referring
                            to the tendency of foreign correspondents to get their views from French
                            and English speaking Vietnamese, who sometimes provide a distorted
                            view.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> noted that “our French friends” believe they
                            have been replaced by the Americans, and are dissatisfied.</p>
                        <p>Before the Strategic Hamlet program, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> stated,
                            there was great discontent in the Vietnamese countryside. Under the
                            pressure of Communist subversion, the army was not capable of protecting
                            the population. Military operations fell into a vacuum because the Army
                            was not helped by the population. The people were dissatisfied with the
                            army, troops were dissatisfied with their officers, and far from
                            protecting the people, the army created popular discontent.</p>
                        <p>Senator Boggs asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> to describe the reaction
                            in North Vietnam to the economic and social progress being made in the
                            Republic of Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said that the North Vietnamese reaction was
                            to seek a method of countering this progress, but that up to now they
                            had not found an adequate one. He said that his objective was not to
                            break the natural process of Communism, but rather to exploit it. The
                            enemy is thus placed in an impasse. The Strategic Hamlets are a point of
                            attraction for <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> troops. Traditional in
                            Asia, leaders have been afraid of <pb n="754" xml:id="pg_754" facs="0774"/>remote regions, because distance can foster dissidence.
                            The Strategic Hamlets will attract Communist troops and they will
                            abandon their leaders. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> compared this
                            tendency to the tendency of the Chinese who migrated to California to
                            implant themselves there and forget their origins.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> noted that the Laotian settlement failed to
                            exploit this tendency, because Laotian neutrality, which is really
                            pro-Communist neutrality, is destroying the hope of eventually
                            liberating North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> pointed out that
                            there was a difference in the Laotian and Vietnamese problems because
                            the Laotians would not fight. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> stated that
                            this was because they do not know how to fight a subversive war. Senator
                                <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> observed that the
                            United States had spent 400 million dollars in Laos to help them fight.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said that they had not been organized and
                            thus did not know how to fight. Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> said that the pro-Western Laotians had only
                            shot their guns into the air, and that the Pathet Lao must have been
                            stiffened by North Vietnamese, and even Chinese, soldiers. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> asked why we had not sent our own cadres to
                            stiffen Gen. <persName corresp="#p_PN3">Phoumi</persName>'s troops.
                            Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> asked if this
                            had ever been suggested. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said he had
                            suggested it to Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>
                            and to the French. He went on to say that if, in foreign policy, we say
                            we accept the facts, that means we refuse to break the balance of
                            forces. But we must break the balance of forces if it is not in our
                            favor. One year ago, the balance was against us, but Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> would not accept the facts and refused to
                            believe the Laotians would not fight. In Vietnam too, before, to [<hi rend="italic">the</hi>?] Strategic Hamlets, the people did not want
                            to fight. As he said earlier, the population was against the soldiers,
                            the soldiers were against the generals, the generals were against the
                            government, and the government was dissatisfied with United States
                            effectiveness. This general dissatisfaction prompted Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> to develop the Strategic Hamlet
                            program.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> noted that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> had said he was dissatisfied with United
                            States aid. The Senator noted that we had sent our best generals to
                            Vietnam, and asked what had been wrong.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said that what he had meant was that when
                            the situation was bad, everyone blames his neighbor. He said he had
                            refused to accept these dissatisfactions, and had thought something else
                            was wrong. What had been needed was a master plan corresponding to the
                            requirements of an underdeveloped country in the Twentieth Century.
                            Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> asked if he had
                            found it in the Strategic Hamlet plan. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said
                            that the Strategic Hamlet plan was only one element. He said that it
                            must be considered in the context a) of Vietnamese history, b) of the
                            historic movement of underdeveloped countries, c) of General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>'s visit, and d) of men in
                            the modern <pb n="755" xml:id="pg_755" facs="0775"/>world. It was part
                            of a new kind of humanism. The freedom which one acquires oneself is
                            more precious than the freedom that is given by Santa Claus.</p>
                        <p>There has been a tremendous enthusiasm arising in the countryside during
                            the last month. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said he did not reproach
                            the United States press for ignoring this popular movement, but he did
                            notice that the press was not up to date.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> asked if this was
                            just the American press.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said that the American press is the most
                            powerful. He said that his ambition was to bring a positive contribution
                            to the United States, which is the leader of the free world. United
                            States strategy leans on regional organizations, but is weak in
                            underdeveloped areas. These areas have been a dead weight so far for the
                            United States and have made no contribution. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said that if we succeed in our experiment
                            here, it will be very valuable for all other countries.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said, with respect to the press, that there was always a
                            time lag in reporting. He said he tries every day to explain to the
                            press how things are moving in Vietnam. One mark of the journalist,
                            however, is skepticism toward government releases. The journalist wants
                            to go out and see for himself. If he sees that the government is
                            applying pressure on the people, he compares this with the government's
                            own statements. The Ambassador asked again that there not be a severe
                            reaction to unfavorable stories, as this only increases the skepticism
                            of the press and makes our mutual task more difficult.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said that we must not concentrate so much on
                            this question because the American people have a good sense of fair
                            play. Once they recognize their mistakes they change their attitude. For
                            a powerful country such as the United States, opposition to the press is
                            nothing. For a small, poor country at war, like Vietnam, there is great
                            popular sensitivity. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said that the
                            Vietnamese are conducting an impassioned war, not subject to reason.
                            There are only 14 million South Vietnamese fighting against
                            international communism, represented by 650 million Chinese. Vietnam has
                            been fighting 23 years for subjective reasons. Its passion must be
                            respected as that is all it has left.</p>
                        <p>He said that he thought the attitude of the American press had changed,
                            because the Americans have a high respect for those who are willing to
                            fight. The Vietnamese are proud to fight, and want to be proud of their
                            friends. He said that the United States reaction to the Cuba situation
                            had made the Vietnamese proud.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> said that we were
                            very pleased to hear this.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> continued that the Vietnamese had been
                            humiliated, however, by the United States policy in Laos and
                            Cambodia.</p>
                        <pb n="756" xml:id="pg_756" facs="0776"/>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_SBK1">Smith</persName> asked Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> to describe the background of the Cambodian
                            and Laotian problems, and to estimate how long they would last. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said that when the United States found an
                            adequate solution for subversive war, we would win. So long as we have
                            no solution, we will be humiliated.</p>
                        <p>Relationships between Vietnam and Laos and Cambodia include United States
                            involvement as a factor. What the Communists are seeking in Laos and
                            Cambodia is to weaken Vietnam and to drive the Americans out. That is
                            all. They accomplished this in Laos and Cambodia and are trying to do it
                            in Vietnam. The Ambassador said that they had not done it yet in
                            Cambodia. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said that Cambodia had asked that
                            the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> withdraw. The Ambassador noted
                            that this had not yet been done, and that the problem was very
                            delicate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said that both <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> realize that their value lies in their distance
                            from the U.S. If they were committed to the U.S., they would lose their
                            value. By leaning toward the Chinese Communists, they retain their
                            position with the U.S., but if they aligned themselves with the U.S.
                            they would be despised. They have a means of pressure on the U.S., but
                            the U.S. has no means of pressure on them.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador asked whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> thought Prince
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> would like to see
                            North Vietnam take over South Vietnam. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said
                            that Sihanouk hates North Vietnam. There are two elements in his policy:
                            1) the conviction that communism is the wave of the future, and 2) the
                            desire to retain his bargaining position with the U.S. He takes
                            advantage of the fact that America has no means of pressure on him. If
                            we develop a theory of subversive war, and can wage it ourselves, we
                            will have a means of pressure on him.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> continued that in the meantime, America
                            should not drop its existing friends for potential friends. <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna</persName> are not friends of America. America has a firm
                            friend here in South Vietnam, and must not sacrifice it for the sake of
                            those who will never be America's friends. If the Communist Chinese come
                            to Southeast Asia, Vietnam will fight them. The Vietnamese would like to
                            fight the Chinese, and there are elements in North Vietnam that would
                            support such a war.</p>
                        <p>At this point the meeting broke up. The Ambassador asked Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>, after the meeting, for clarification on
                            one point. Had Mr. Crawford of <hi rend="italic">Newsweek</hi> magazine
                            said that he had not understood our explanation of the situation in
                            Vietnam? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said that Mr. Crawford had
                            understood it, but that he, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>, had clarified
                            his understanding of the problem.</p>

                        <p>On leaving, Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName>
                            thanked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> for being so frank and direct. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName> said that his frankness was an expression
                            of Vietnamese friendship for the United States, and added that America
                            is Vietnam's only friend in the world.</p>

                            appraised the internal political situation in South Vietnam over the
                            past year. Although the leaders of South Vietnam apparently believed
                            that the tide was turning against insurgency and subversion, the
                            memorandum concluded that this optimism was premature, and that at best

                        <p>Dear Fritz: This letter can be put aside and read later when you have
                            fewer visitors.</p>
                        <p>We were very pleased here with Ken Crawford's cover story in <hi rend="italic">Newsweek</hi> on Viet-Nam of December 10, 1962. If
                            anything it was a bit optimistic, but we can use some balancing cheer in
                            the public prints. I hope to get to the <hi rend="italic">Saturday
                                Evening Post</hi> people about the two poor articles in their
                            November 24th issue. Bernard Fall's recommendations certainly follow
                            very close to the neutralist, crypto-communist line. I don't think he is
                            a communist, but his emotions have been so long wrapped up in Viet-Nam
                            that his judgement is false. I must say I was surprised that the <hi rend="italic">Post</hi> published it. The article on South Viet-Nam
                            in <pb n="758" xml:id="pg_758" facs="0778"/>the same issue by Harold H.
                            Martin left one with the impression that all of the Americans are
                            champing at the bit for more military action, but are being held back by
                            a timid President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>. This
                            non-accurate assessment presumably reflects the many and galling
                            frustrations under which all military advisors work in the field and is
                            probably also connected with the fact that they can't know everything or
                            even enough of what's going on in Saigon. Halberstam's articles also
                            rely heavily on military sources.</p>
                        <p>I have been discussing this here with some of our public relations people
                            and we would like to encourage you to give even more time than you now
                            do to the newspaper men so that their reporting will reflect a better
                            overall assessment of the war from the point of view of all American
                            interests involved. I don't know what your present practice is, but
                            wonder if you would consider giving a weekly backgrounder. I realize
                            this can be time consuming, annoying and that they don't always appear
                            to listen, but I do believe it will pay off not only as a means of
                            briefing them, but also as an occasion of give and take exchange of news
                            and as a chance for them to vent their frustrations to the top American.
                            The reporters are there and they are going to report the war to the free
                            world press. Since the Vietnamese are doing such a poor job, it devolves
                            on us to see that we get better understanding and support from the
                            American press. I remember how well you handled the press during the
                            backgrounder which you gave here last winter, as well as your TV
                                appearance.<note n="2" xml:id="d325fn2">Regarding <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>'s visit, January 5-14, see
                                    <ref target="#d14">Documents 14</ref>-<ref target="#d16">16</ref>.</note> Since you have both the capacity and the
                            position to speak for the Americans, allow me to sell you on doing as
                            much as you can, I am sure that this will give us the results in the
                            press here which we badly need. In fact this gap—the explanation of the
                            war to the American citizen—seems to us the biggest remaining problem to
                            be licked in our efforts to maintain an effective and long-continuing
                            American support of the Vietnamese defense effort. Furthermore, if you
                            demonstrate that the American press can be briefed successfully and that
                            they are, after all, human, the Vietnamese may be encouraged to be more
                            forthcoming and to take on more fully the job of describing their own
                            war to the foreign newsmen. However, I realize the deep emotional
                            problem which you face here with Counselor <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>.</p>
                        <p>I was asked recently about how Americans are briefed on the concept that
                            as guests in the Vietnamese house they should not be publicly critical
                            of Vietnamese efforts. I recall in 1959 that incoming personnel, both
                            military and civilian, used to receive several days briefing and I
                            suppose that this continues. I realize that to circulate anything in
                            writing which could be interpreted by the newspaper men as an order to
                            U.S. personnel to keep their traps shut would hit the <pb n="759" xml:id="pg_759" facs="0779"/>headlines the next day. I therefore
                            suppose the guest-in-the-house idea is presented orally, in the course
                            of indoctrination briefing. In view of the frustrations all Americans
                            face in Viet-Nam, particularly those in the field, I suppose it is one
                            of those topics on which people need frequent oral reminders. If fish
                            and guests stink after three days, sometimes the guest's view of the
                            host can become jaundiced during the course of the visit.</p>
                        <p>New subject. I have pouched to you yesterday several old despatches and
                            telegrams which I drafted on the history of the Vietnamese-Cambodian
                            frontier and other aspects of the relations of the two countries. This
                            is not only pride of authorship but also because there seem to be no
                            other documents in the files. I concluded in 1958 that there was no
                            sacred document which would reveal the one, true line. There does appear
                            to have been a series of decrees (cited in the telegrams I sent you)
                            issued at about the time the French pulled out but apparently the
                            decrees did not have any maps annexed to them. Within a few days I will
                            get together with the Geographer's Office and send a telegram to Saigon
                            and Phnom Penh giving a round-up of the information available in
                            Washington. This incidentally includes a full set of 1:40,000 aerial
                            photographs made in the late 1950s for the Army Map Service. More on
                            this anon.</p>
                        <p>Ted gave a most excellent discourse on the situation in Viet-Nam
                            yesterday to the assembled members of Cot's <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> Task Force. It evoked much interest and sympathy. He

                        <p>In Saigon I had conversations with President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>, Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_VVM1">Mau</persName>, Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> and several members of the Assembly.<note n="2" xml:id="d327fn2">A memorandum of the conversation with <persName corresp="#p_VVM1">Mau</persName>, which dealt with the situation

                            </note> In addition to the Ambassador, I also met with selected members
                            of the Country Team, particularly the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Station Chief and the <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWC2">Trueheart</persName>,
                            and some U.S. military officers. I also visited two provinces in the
                            highland area (Pleiku and the new province of Phu Bon) and one in the
                            coastal area (Tuy Hao), as well as the new Pleiyit mountain commando
                            school.</p>
                        <p>My general impressions and observations are as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. The spirit of the Vietnamese officials and the U.S. officials and
                            advisers, and the relations between them, are very impressive. While
                            there is a subjective tendency on the part of both to emphasize the
                            positive and to minimize the negative, the undoubted gains are
                            substantial. The negative factor for which it is difficult to find a
                            satisfactory answer is that both the U.S. and Vietnamese estimates
                            indicate a significant increase in organized Viet Cong strength during
                            the past year. It is also difficult, even in the field close to the
                            area, to obtain a clear view of the level and relative importance of
                            present infiltration through Laos.</p>
                        <p>2. There is no basis for believing the “war can be over” in another year.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>'s most optimistic
                            estimate is three years.</p>
                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> is now doing a vigorous and
                            effective job, and there is excellent coordination between all elements
                            of the Country Team as well as with the Vietnamese Government.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> continues to be very
                            suspicious of French motives and these suspicions have been reinforced
                            by the French attitude on the recent <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> neutrality proposals.<note n="3" xml:id="d327fn3">For text of <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>'s letter to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>, August 20, requesting
                                official recognition of Cambodian neutrality, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1962</hi>, pp.
                                1002-1003.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> constantly seeks reassurance
                            that we are not going to be influenced by the French to seek a
                            negotiated “neutral solution” in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>5. Both Thailand and South Vietnam see Cambodia as “their Cuba” and hope
                            that if <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> invites in the
                            Chinese Communists we will take an equally vigorous stand.</p>
                        <p>6. The Montagnard program is very impressive and the Vietnamese have
                            embraced it with enthusiasm. In some ways they seem to be going to
                            greater lengths to woo the Montagnards than their own people.</p>
                        <p>7. In the field one feels much less squeamishness on using chemical crop
                            destruction than when back here in Washington. First, napalm has for
                            long been used quite extensively. Also, one gets the feeling that the
                            local officials and military have a fairly accurate picture of what <pb n="762" xml:id="pg_762" facs="0782"/>crops are going where. Also,
                            one is reassured by the evident effective measures for relief of
                            Montagnard refugees. In addition, there seems to be much less of a
                            psychological or political problem in the use of such methods against
                            Montagnard crops than would be the case against the crops of the more
                            sophisticated Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p>8. The $189 million ceiling on <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> for FY
                            '63 is substantially interfering with our ability to fund the very
                            important “strategic hamlet kits” and the less important TR-5 hamlet
                            radios. <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> feels the
                            ceiling should, if possible, be raised to $205 million.</p>
                        <p>9. The “Province Rehabilitation Committee” chaired on the U.S. side by
                                <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TWC2">Trueheart</persName> and on the Vietnamese
                            side by <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>, with the Minister of Interior as
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>'s “action officer”, is working excellently
                            and is the point at which military, political and economic plans and
                            programs are really tied together. One very senior U.S. military officer
                            told me “<persName corresp="#p_TWC2">Trueheart</persName> comes closer
                            to carrying out the day-to-day overall direction of the war as a whole
                            than any other individual in Saigon”.</p>
                        <p>10. A conversation with <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> is an
                            experience never to be forgotten. The words flow in an unending stream
                            and for one whose French is less than perfect the strain of following is
                            intense, particularly as he makes many of his points very indirectly. He
                            has opinions on most subjects from the relationship of taxi dancers to
                            espionage to Chinese Communist tactics in Guinea. However, he listened
                            carefully and with evident interest to a short summary of the events
                            with respect to Cuba.</p>
                        <p>11. In the eight-day period from November 29 to December 6 eight separate
                            Congressional delegations visited Saigon, of which four called on
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>. While Saigon, as
                            does any other post, welcomes serious Congressional visits such a number
                            of uncoordinated visits and the often exacting nature of the visitors'
                            demands not only impose extraordinary burdens on the staffs of the
                            posts, but also on the good nature of the local officials. For example,
                            one delegation demanded that all members of the party, including wives
                            and subordinate staff members, be present at the meeting with President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> and established a strict
                            limit on the time they would make available for the meeting. Another
                            insisted on advance approval of table seating. In Vientiane at the last
                            minute another advanced its departure time, requiring the Ambassador to
                            produce the Prime Minister (which he did) for a hurried 11:30 lunch,
                            etc., etc. It is the feeling of the posts that much of this results from
                            excessive zeal on the part of escort officers in interpreting the
                            supposed wishes of the principals. However, much of it leaves an
                            impression of bad manners and all too often an impression on local
                            officials that they and our Ambassadors abroad are expected to jump at
                            the whim of any Congressional visitor. This is not good for the United
                            States. There are, of course, notable exceptions in which I would
                            include Senator Jackson, from what I observed.</p>

                        <p rend="center">I. Recommendations</p>
                        <p>A. Continue to place top priority on the strategic hamlet program. Adopt
                            and refine present plans and programs but prove out what we are now
                            doing before turning to new plans or tactics. Set up evaluation
                            machinery to determine the best means of establishing effective
                            strategic hamlets.</p>
                        <p>B. Use our influence and resources to insure that hamlet authorities have
                            adequate means and powers, including the control of separate hamlet
                            budgets and the power to inflict minor punishments. Seek to increase the
                            competence and prestige of hamlet authorities by training, publicity,
                            and rewards.</p>
                        <p>C. Strengthen the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> by more contact
                            with American advisors, frequent on-spot retraining, and more emphasis
                            on civic action training.</p>
                        <p>D. Continue limited support for the Force Populaire as an experimental
                            and promising form of <gloss target="#t_CIDG1">CIDG</gloss>, but resist
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> plans to cut <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> funds or strength in order to finance
                            the Force Populaire.</p>
                        <p>E. In connection with recommendations B and C, seek to assign US advisors
                            to district chiefs.</p>
                        <p>F. Work for better overall control of Citizens Irregular Defense Groups.
                            Standardization or formalization of the <gloss target="#t_CIDG1">CIDG</gloss> is not desirable, but improved machinery for
                            coordination with other counterinsurgency measures and plans is

                        <p>I spent 40 days in Viet-Nam and visited 17 provinces, making a special
                            effort to compare the present situation with conditions as I observed
                            them in March and April of this year and during the period July 1958 to
                            July 1961. The following report is necessarily impressionistic. I did
                            not have time to go into any one problem exhaustively, and fact is not
                            always easy to come by in Viet-Nam. </p>
                        <p>Since the fall of last year, we have moved from a situation in which the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> were clearly winning to a
                            stand-off. This is real progress, particularly in a guerrilla war. But
                            the tide has not fumed. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are still
                            very strong, and our key programs are still in many respects
                            experimental.</p>
                        <p>I see no prospect of completely eliminating the Viet Cong by actions in
                            South Viet-Nam. So long as the country is undergoing the strains and
                            tensions of modernization, and so long as it is relatively safe and
                            cheap for the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to exploit those
                            strains and tensions, we will have the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            with us. But I do believe that the programs now in motion in South
                            Viet-Nam, if pursued consistently and vigorously, will reduce <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> strength and activity to the point where
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> can handle the situation with
                            greatly reduced US military assistance. This is likely to take several
                            years at least.</p>
                        <p>The strategic hamlet program is the heart of our effort and deserves top
                            priority. While it has not—and probably will not—bring democracy to
                            rural Viet-Nam, it provides truly local administration for the first
                            time. Coupled with measures to increase rice production and farmer
                            income, these local administrations can work a revolution in rural
                            Viet-Nam. But it will not come quickly and it is by no means
                            assured.</p>
                        <pb n="765" xml:id="pg_765" facs="0785"/>
                        <p>On the military side, there is no question that <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> and the paramilitary are fuming in markedly better
                            performance. Morale is high, they are doing more night work, killing
                            fewer prisoners, and getting more intelligence from the people. There is
                            also no blinking the fact that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> do
                            not seem to be declining in numbers, weapons or ability. Moreover, the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> could probably increase <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> strength substantially in a short period
                            of time by stepping up infiltration.</p>
                        <p>The most encouraging things I noted on this trip include the general
                            success of our people in winning confidence and working with the
                            Vietnamese (this is significant progress over the suspicion I observed
                            six months ago), the training and arming of the Montagnard, increased
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and US emphasis on rural
                            economic programs, and a general lift in morale.</p>
                        <p rend="center">III. Strategic Hamlets</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. General Observations</p>
                        <p>This program is off to a good start. Except in Central Viet-Nam, where
                            the program has been weakened by <persName corresp="#p_NDC1">Ngo Dinh
                                Can</persName>'s failure to support it, provincial and local
                            authorities have a far better understanding of the concept than was the
                            case six months ago. The hamlets vary greatly in quality, and the
                            program suffers from the general, chronic shortage of leadership and
                            organization. But as a mixture of political, economic, and military
                            measures, the strategic hamlet effort appears to offer the best hope of
                            defeating the Viet Cong. As such, it should be the main focus of our
                            planning, and we should resist any tendency to reduce its top
                            priority.</p>
                        <p>We must recognize that our experience with strategic hamlets is quite
                            limited. The concept in its present form may not be the best means of
                            dealing with the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. We should not be
                            doctrinaire about standards or models at this time.</p>
                        <p>We should undertake systematic and continuing evaluation of the program.
                            Ideally, this would be done by a joint US-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> team with its own transport and with authority to visit
                            any hamlet at any time. Failing this, we should at least encourage the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to undertake systematic
                            evaluation, independent of the provincial authorities, while we make an
                            effort to do the same on our side through sector advisors and the new
                            embassy provincial reporting program.</p>
                        <p>One example of the need for evaluation—and the importance of not being
                            doctrinaire at this time—is the matter of fences. Flimsy, halfhearted
                            bamboo barriers around some of the hamlets are often the subject of
                            scornful criticism by our people. But there is no point in demanding
                            elaborate perimeters everywhere before we really know how important the
                            perimeter is. Conversations with missionaries and local authorities,
                            including several hamlet chiefs, suggest that the so <pb n="766" xml:id="pg_766" facs="0786"/>called “political fences” are far from
                            useless. They have the immediate psychological value of making the
                            hamlet a visible geographical entity, automatically set up “in” and
                            “out” groups, force the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> to at least
                            symbolically violate the whole hamlet to get at any individual. Also,
                            the Vietnamese generally like hedges and fences around their homes and
                            have a feeling of family security and unity behind them. Even a poor
                            hamlet fence has something of this effect on the whole community, and
                            what counts in an attack is the attitudes on the inside of the fence</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Some Immediate Results</p>
                        <p>It is a truism to say that this war is as much political as military. The
                            political side of the strategic hamlet program is sometimes described as
                            the establishment of rice roots democracy by means of hamlet elections.
                            I don't believe this is happening (see below). But the new hamlets do
                            achieve at least two immediate political effects.</p>
                        <p>One of the first results of setting up a strategic hamlet is that it
                            tends to bring loyalties into the open and force choice on the
                            uncommitted. Some who are pro-<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> can of
                            course hide their sympathies and contribute to the building of the
                            hamlet with enough enthusiasm to be regarded as good citizens. Some of
                            the uncommitted can do what is required of them and still maintain their
                            neutral posture. But the building of the fence is a symbolic act which
                            is lost on neither the peasant nor the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. Few peasants are consummate actors, and as the hamlet is
                            built, their sympathies become apparent to neighbors and friends and
                            hamlet authorities.</p>
                        <p>This separation of hamlet populations into groups of various shades of
                            loyalty and disloyalty to the government is already partly accomplished.
                            In Hai Yen visitors are told how many of the people are pro-<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, how many have relatives with the
                            Communists, and how many actively support the government. District
                            chiefs have always kept records on suspect elements, and these records
                            are available to the hamlet authorities. I think we can reasonably hope
                            that the process will be carried out over the next year to the point
                            where there are relatively few Vietnamese whose political coloration is
                            not known to the government. This will be a major step toward the
                            ultimate separation of the people from the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Another immediate political result of the program is the building, for
                            the first time, of truly <hi rend="italic">local</hi> administrations.
                            The hamlet officials may not be democratically selected by our lights,
                            but they are not immune to social pressures. They <hi rend="italic">live</hi> in the hamlet. Village officials may be able to ignore
                            real grievances to some extent. District chiefs certainly can. It will
                            be far more difficult for the hamlet officials who, on the average, are
                            dealing with only about 1,000 of their friends, neighbors and
                            relatives.</p>
                        <pb n="767" xml:id="pg_767" facs="0787"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. The Matter of Elections</p>
                        <p>I observed closely, in the provinces, the 1959 National Assembly
                            elections. The question uppermost in the minds of the peasants then was
                            not “Who should I choose to represent me?” but simply “What do they want
                            of me?” I saw no evidence of fraud, and I don't think there was any in
                            the areas I visited. But the government candidates got 99% of the vote.
                            It was a simple matter of the peasant's observing that one of the
                            candidates wore the government label and concluding that the prudent
                            course was to vote for him.</p>
                        <p>Much the same sort of process appears to be at work in the hamlet
                            elections. The village or district chief can informally let it be known
                            who he favors for office—usually the present hamlet chief—and the
                            election is carried out accordingly. Evidence of this came to me in the
                            remarks of a number of Vietnamese officials. Nearly all conceded the
                            necessity for close control of the elections. In several cases, they
                            said frankly that rural Viet-Nam will have to wait a generation or
                            longer to have real democracy.</p>
                        <p>One Province Chief said that of course he was controlling the elections:
                            “Democracy here cannot come before security. It will take at least ten
                            years.” The chief of a provincial council observed that the people
                            require strong leadership and so the officials must put forward the
                            candidates. A Regional Delegate's deputy remarked that there are two or
                            three families in each hamlet who have always called the shots, and they
                            will continue to do so for at least another generation. A missionary
                            pointed out that the kind of direct confrontation involved in western
                            style elections is repugnant to the Vietnamese; they would rather make
                            such decisions informally to prevent loss of face: “Of course the
                            elections are decided in advance. The people would be very uncomfortable
                            if they were not.”</p>
                        <p>I was also told by <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> advisors that
                            the old hamlet chief is usually elected to be the new hamlet chief.
                            Three hamlet chiefs themselves told me that they had been the “thon
                            troung” or hamlet chief long before they were <hi rend="italic">elected</hi> to the job. While a hamlet charter which I obtained in
                            Binh Tuy sets the term of office at one year, other hamlet charters
                            shown to me had no term of office, and provincial officials generally
                            said that there is none: “We will have new elections when they are
                            necessary.”</p>
                        <p>In short, given the character of rural Vietnamese society plus the
                            Communist threat, there is at this time little likelihood of free
                            elections as we conceive them.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">D. The Aims of the Program</p>
                        <p>The basic aim is, of course, to separate the people from the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. To achieve this, I am not convinced that
                            there is any present need to impose our political ideas on the
                            Vietnamese peasants. Free elections and town meetings can come later. If
                            we can get effective local administration—albeit paternalistic—plugged
                            into the national administration, if we can open up a few lines of
                            communication up as well as down, and if we can involve the peasant in
                            the defense of a felt stake in a developing hamlet economy tied into the
                            national economy, we will have done quite enough to freeze out the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. We are by no means sure of doing
                            any of these things. To help bring them about, I think the following
                            ideas should be considered:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Adequate means and authority for hamlet
                            officials.</p>
                        <p>If the hamlet chief and his council are forced to refer all decisions to
                            the village chief and rely on him for sanctions, if they must depend on
                            allotments from the village budget to carry out their improvement plans,
                            and in general, if they appear only as feeble appendages of the village
                            and district authorities, they are not likely to be very successful.</p>
                        <p>The hamlet charters now being written by each strategic hamlet invest the
                            hamlet council with very slight powers (almost exclusively advisory) and
                            no sanctions. They are completely silent on the authority of the hamlet
                            administrative committee, which is to be the real governing body in the
                            hamlet. (The charters follow very closely the model charter issued by
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> as a training document.)</p>
                        <p>I am told that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is considering
                            authorizing hamlet budgets. I am much in favor of this, and feel
                            strongly that the powers of the hamlet administrative committee ought to
                            be spelled out in a <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> decree or law
                            and incorporated into the hamlet charters as well. They should have the
                            power to collect and disburse hamlet funds, enact and enforce local
                            regulations, and be armed with authority to inflict minor penalties on
                            offenders.</p>
                        <p>Our monetary assistance to the hamlet “self-help” projects in Hai Yen
                            will help to arm the hamlet authorities with the necessary means and
                            authority. But this can not be more than a partial and transitory
                            answer. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will have to accomplish
                            this itself, probably at the expense of village administration.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Training, rewards, prestige for hamlet
                            officials.</p>
                        <p>Getting the right people in office is important, of course, but getting
                            the most out of them is probably more so. Being a good hamlet chief is
                            well within the native abilities of a great many peasants, but <pb n="769" xml:id="pg_769" facs="0789"/>few are sufficiently trained
                            and motivated. We should press for better training and retraining of
                            these people, get into the process ourselves (perhaps via sector
                            advisors) when we can.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> could help prepare a weekly or
                            monthly publication for hamlet chiefs. Such a publication could include
                            practical administrative advice, using the experiences and successes of
                            various hamlet chiefs as concrete examples. The publication would serve
                            both as a training device and a morale builder for hamlet officials. We
                            might also consider partially underwriting contact training teams, to
                            include perhaps a US administrative or PsyWar expert, to train hamlet
                            officials on the spot.</p>
                        <p>A national congress of strategic hamlet chiefs held some time, say next
                            spring, would serve as a useful device for training and exchange of
                            ideas, while building the prestige of the hamlet chiefs. Awards for
                            outstanding performance, with appropriate ballyhoo, might do a lot to
                            improve the prestige and morale of those prime targets for <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> assassination. Perhaps the President
                            could be induced to make the awards at the national Strategic Hamlet
                            Congress.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Economic Development.</p>
                        <p>A real stake in the status quo at the hamlet level for every peasant
                            could be a powerful weapon for the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.
                            The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is wisely putting its funds for
                            schools, agricultural credit, dispensaries, etc. into the strategic
                            hamlets. Our aid in the form of fertilizer, plant protection chemicals,
                            surplus food, and the pig program is effectively reinforcing this
                            effort.</p>
                        <p>But the heart of rural Viet-Nam is rice. If we want to help the peasant
                            in a way that really makes sense to him, if we want to increase peasant
                            income and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> resources, if we mean to
                            give the hamlets a real economic lease on life, we must increase rice
                            production dramatically. Vietnamese rice yields are very low compared
                            with Taiwan and Japan. The yield could be increased, perhaps doubled, if
                            we brought in, on a big scale, the fertilizers and the third country
                            technicians to carry out effective, large-scale agricultural extension
                            and improvement.</p>
                        <p>This would be expensive. It would require facing the fact that Vietnamese
                            rice would be in competition with Louisiana rice because a large
                            increase in rice production would mean exports (some could be exported
                            in the form of pork, beef and alcohol, of course). It would take time,
                            probably a minimum of several years. It would also require a sharp
                            about-face in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> price policies, which
                            are now aimed at deliberately holding down the domestic price of
                            rice.</p>
                        <pb n="770" xml:id="pg_770" facs="0790"/>
                        <p>I am told that the world rice market is good now and that long term
                            prospects are also good. I understand that Vietnamese rice sells in
                            Saigon now for about half what it would bring in Hong Kong. In 1939
                            Viet-Nam exported something like 1-1/2 million tons of rice.</p>
                        <p>Analysts such as Rostow say an agricultural revolution is the necessary
                            first step toward take-off in economic development. Our aid to roads and
                            light industries, helpful though it has been, has not over the past
                            seven years brought the take-off point visibly nearer in Viet-Nam. I
                            think rice might. In any event, an increase in peasant income should
                            help against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and perhaps enable
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to shoulder a little more of the
                            cost of defending <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Even if increased US aid for rice production is not possible, I believe
                            we should use our influence to persuade the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to alter its price policy. I am certainly no expert on
                            this matter, but conversations here and in Washington, with both
                            Vietnamese and Americans, makes me think the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> could safely increase the price of rice, perhaps could
                            even insure a direct income increase for the peasant by controlling
                            directly or indirectly the distribution channels. (If they can protect
                            the harvest against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, I think they
                            can protect the farmer against the middleman.)</p>
                        <p>If such a policy were announced by the President as a direct effort to
                            help the farmer, it would have a lot of political impact. I am told a
                            moderate price increase would not much affect living costs for urban
                            Vietnamese, which the GVN generally controls in any event. <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s policy of favoring and
                            developing the agricultural sector, announced in his State of the Union
                            message, suggests he could be persuaded. I am told only he could make
                            the decision to change price policy. Certainly only he could get maximum
                            political mileage out of it.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. District Advisors.</p>
                        <p>Sector advisors have had a marked effect on the attitudes and performance
                            of provincial officials. Although it varies greatly from province to
                            province, I believe there is no doubt of the value of their influence on
                            provincial administration. Much of this has been a matter of osmosis in
                            day to day contact.</p>
                        <p>District, village and hamlet officials are not benefiting from this kind
                            of contact because the sector advisor simply has too little time. While
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> reluctance to permit Americans
                            to operate at district level might prove insuperable, I believe the
                            assignment of district advisors should be considered as an important
                            means of improving local administration.</p>
                        <p>District advisors would mean a personnel increase of about 250 men plus
                            the added burden of supporting them. They would be in exposed positions
                            in many cases and we could expect casualties. But I think they could do
                            a very important job.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Morale</p>
                        <p>Morale is greatly improved among government officials at all levels. I
                            have the distinct impression that many if not most civil servants
                            believe the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will win in the space of
                            a year or two. It is certainly risky to try to judge the attitude of the
                            people as a whole, but I think there can be little doubt that in their
                            eyes, too, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is now in a much more
                            favorable position than it was in late 1961.</p>
                        <p>Supporting my impression that the people believe the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will win is the report that the
                            government is getting more information from ordinary people. American
                            advisors in the field told me of a number of instances in which
                            villagers tipped off the authorities to impending <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> attacks. Six months ago, I heard almost no instances of
                            this kind of intelligence.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Better Military Performance</p>
                        <p>Though there were some vociferous dissents, our advisors say that the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces are doing more and better
                            night work. There is still room for much improvement in patrolling and
                            ambushing. But the night no longer belongs only to the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Handling and exploitation of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> prisoners
                            is also better. While rough interrogation is still too common, the
                            outright killing of prisoners has been cut by at least 80%, according to
                            our advisors in the field. Whereas in the past almost every operation
                            saw prisoners deliberately killed, this is now rare. The reason:
                            pressure from our advisors. One man told me he fumed his own weapon on a
                            Vietnamese officer to prevent the killing of a prisoner. Advisors often
                            call for helicopters to rush prisoners out, thus getting them rapidly to
                            competent interrogators as well as saving their skins.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. Use of Montagnards</p>
                        <p>I was very favorably impressed by the job <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and our Special Forces are doing with the Montagnards.
                            Judging by what I saw and was told at Buon Enao and in northern Kontum,
                            there is every reason to believe that we can choke off most infiltration
                            via the high plateau in about a year's time.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is also doing better by the
                            Montagnards than ever before. While most Vietnamese officials still
                            privately regard the Montagnards as something less than human, they have
                            for the most part thoroughly grasped the importance of using the
                            Montagnards against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. It is not
                            true that the Montagnards are coming over to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> because of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s
                            benevolence. Their chief motivation is a natural desire to get out of a
                            crossfire. But the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has recognized
                                <pb n="772" xml:id="pg_772" facs="0792"/>the opportunity presented,
                            and while sometimes still moving far too slowly to suit our people, is
                            honestly attempting to help the tribespeople. One example: an <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> commander cut his own men's rations
                            to provide food for the Montagnards until relief supplies arrived.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">D. U.S. Advisors</p>
                        <p>The quality of our people in the field is high. They have gained more
                            acceptance than I thought possible six months ago. They have steadily
                            eroded, if not solved, many military and some local semi-political
                            problems by ad hoc, personal pressure and persuasion. They are
                            particularly impressive where I might have expected them to be weakest:
                            the lower ranking officers, from lieutenant to major, are proving
                            themselves adaptable and imaginative.</p>
                        <p>I think it worth pointing out that our military people are almost
                            universally suffering from various degrees of acute frustration. They
                            can't command, they only advise. This is surely the hardest role a good
                            officer can play. To this must be added the frustrations of dealing
                            intimately every day with the Vietnamese mind, an underdeveloped
                            technology and transport system, a major language problem, and the
                            unfamiliar tactics of an enemy they can rarely come to grips with. In
                            spite of all this, they are doing a good job. My hat is off to them.</p>

                            Populaire</p>
                        <p>I am concerned by reports that the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>
                            may be dropped or cut in favor of an expanded Force Populaire. While the
                                <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> has many faults as it is now
                            constituted, it has borne the brunt of the VC attack for a long time.
                            With better training and arms, it is beginning to take a heavy toll of
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. It is a local force, bound in
                            most cases to the defense of the village by personal ties.</p>
                        <p>The Force Populaire is frankly experimental. It has to my knowledge taken
                            no casualties. The number of VC killed or captured by the <gloss target="#t_FP1">FP</gloss> must be around 10-20, judging by the
                            accounts of a number of people who should know. It has worked, I
                            believe, exclusively in safe areas, and although it has been in
                            existence for about a year has admittedly made no clear contribution to
                            security. The concept as explained to me in Hue is excellent—but it is
                            not clear that in actual practice it has been or can be applied.</p>
                        <p>The Force Populaire also raises some troublesome problems. It is not
                            controlled by the province chief or by the division commander in the
                            area. It is run by a provincial committee, with overall direction from
                            Brother Can in Hue. In many cases it is not apparently meshed in any way
                            with the strategic hamlet program, though I believe some province chiefs
                            are trying hard to bring it into the overall plan. In at <pb n="773" xml:id="pg_773" facs="0793"/>least one instance, the FP got itself
                            into a lively firefight with the Civil Guard through this lack of
                            coordination. The <gloss target="#t_FP1">FP</gloss> is engaged in
                            essentially political work as an arm of the <persName corresp="#p_NDC1">Ngo Dinh Can</persName> organization; there is here more than a
                            hint of an armed political faction.</p>
                        <p>Though trained in part by special forces, the <gloss target="#t_FP1">FP</gloss> for some reason is an organization so secret that most
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> advisors have never heard of
                            it. This includes at least two senior advisors, one of them the senior
                            advisor in a Corps area. I fail to understand the need for such secrecy,
                            especially as the presence of <gloss target="#t_FP1">FP</gloss> in a
                            village is not … a secret.</p>
                        <p>This is an interesting experiment, and I think we should continue to
                            support it to some degree. The idea of direct personal contact, peasant
                            to peasant, on behalf of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has
                            much to recommend it. But this organization can only supplement, not
                            replace, the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_FP1">FP</gloss> demands of its members a very large
                            measure of patriotism, political sophistication, practical psychology,
                            initiative, and a willingness to undertake hard and dangerous work for
                            no material advantage. Such people are in short supply.</p>

                        <p>There is also discussion of dropping the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> in favor of unpaid village and hamlet youth defenders.
                            This may be possible ultimately, but at the moment would be very unwise.
                            Inadequately trained and motivated though they may be, the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> are generally still much better in
                            these departments than the youth defenders. They are likely to be so for
                            some time. Moreover, even when the youth defenders are in much better
                            shape, they will still require a nearby reserve or strike force at the
                            village level. The <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> can continue to
                            serve that function. And of course, dropping the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> would likely result in an increased rural
                            underemployment problem, further depressing the rural economy and quite

                            direction. We could protest vigorously any tendency by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to throw away this aid. But I think we
                            ought to go further.</p>

                            on the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>, which takes most of the casualties and

                            and example from our advisors. The <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>
                            is trained at a center and allowed to return to their home villages and
                            relapse into their old ways. Anyone who knows the rural Vietnamese knows
                            that they seldom learn a new thing for once and for all. The <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> above all need continued training and

                            District advisors could also help in this respect.</p>

                            effort—and one that is paying off—is the emphasis on civic action for

                            solution is not to replace them with Force Populaire or village youth.
                            (Many would be the same people, anyhow.) What is needed is more emphasis
                            on civic action training at the training centers. We have left this part
                            of SDC training up to the Vietnamese in spite of our success in getting
                            into the civic action training of ARVN. More contact with American

                            Rehabilitation</p>
                        <p>The strategic hamlet program promises to reveal the political loyalties
                            of most of the people in the hamlets. It is not clear, however, how the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> intends to deal with elements
                            inside the hamlets which are not active <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, but who nevertheless remain basically sympathetic to
                            the Communists. In cases where most of the people are pro-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> or neutral, identification may be
                            enough. Strict control plus social pressures will probably be all that
                            is required to bring these people around.</p>
                        <p>The ease with which the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> recruit men and
                            support their activities in some provinces suggests, however, that at
                            least in some areas large segments of hamlet populations will have to be
                            classified as VC sympathizers. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            evidently intends to make these people third class citizens at best,
                            political prisoners at worst. I don't think this will have the desired
                            result. What is needed is a rehabilitation program, and I am not aware
                            that the strategic hamlet effort now includes any systematic plan for
                            winning over <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> sympathizers and
                            supporters.</p>
                        <p>One approach might be to make it clear to <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> sympathizers and supporters that, while their past is
                            known, the future is unprejudiced. Everyone starts even in the new
                            hamlet, with equal access to agricultural credit, free medicine,
                            schools, communal land, etc. However, if after six months, there is
                            evidence of continued support for the VC, the guilty parties would have
                            their rights and privileges abridged by the hamlet council. If they
                            behaved for, say six months thereafter, the rights and privileges could
                            be restored by the council.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. Infiltration</p>
                        <p>Information on the nature and amount of infiltration remains
                            unsatisfactory. As the Montagnard trail watchers and strike forces get
                            into action, I think we will get a better picture of what is happening
                            on the plateau. If all goes well, these forces may in fact pretty well
                            stop infiltration across the highlands.</p>
                        <p>This will not end the threat of infiltration, however, for there remains
                            the Cambodian frontier in the lowlands. I am not at all sure that
                            strategic hamlets can keep infiltrators from moving directly into the
                            delta from Cambodia. This will be all the more difficult if, as seems
                            likely, GVN-RKG relations continue bad.</p>
                        <p>The threat of infiltration seems very serious. I believe Ho could
                            probably double his hard core <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> rather
                            quickly by infiltration if it seemed necessary. He could do this before
                            we could seal off the plateau. After the plateau is closed, it could
                            still be done via Cambodia.</p>
                        <p>Such a move would be relatively cheap and safe for Ho and the Bloc, and
                            the stakes are high. After Cuba, <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> will be looking for a way to humiliate us and
                            placate the ChiComs. It seems unlikely that he will want to restrain Ho.
                            I don't think there can be any doubt about Ho's determination to reunite
                            Viet-Nam. In short, I believe we ought to be prepared for a heavy
                            increase in infiltration and the consequent increase in VC strength at
                            any time.</p>

                            be “formalized” or “standardized.” But they <pb n="776" xml:id="pg_776" facs="0796"/>do need to be controlled and coordinated. Lessons

                        <p>I am not convinced that the use of aircraft against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> has been sufficiently refined even yet. I

                        <p>Relieving posts and units under attack is certainly a very valuable and
                            legitimate role for air power. In some cases, <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> bases are isolated sufficiently to justify tactical
                            bombing. But I am convinced that bombing “<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> villages” rarely pays off in the sense that it hurts the

                            given unit. If the division commander wants to assign them to another
                            unit in his command, he must get permission from Saigon. Transferring
                            radios from hospital units not yet ready for them to fighting units that
                            needed them took two months. The boys are hammering away on this, but we
                            shouldn't overlook it.</p>
                        <p>Connected with chain of command difficulties is the matter of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> reaction to combat losses. A number of
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> advisors feel that good
                            Vietnamese commanders are hamstrung by fear of casualties. They describe
                            these officers as personally brave, but professionally cowards. By this
                            they mean that <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> will remove
                            or demote any officer who suffers heavy losses, even though he is
                            successful.</p>
                        <p>The example brought most forcefully to my attention by <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> advisors was that of Colonel Cao,
                            commander of the 7th division. Although recently decorated for highly
                            successful operations against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, Cao
                            was reportedly called on the carpet by <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> because 18 <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> were
                            killed in a <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> ambush. The President kept
                            him waiting without breakfast or lunch, so frightened him—he was on pins
                            and needles hoping to make Brigadier—that he cut back heavily on his
                            operations. (Since my return, Cao's promotion has been announced.)</p>
                        <pb n="777" xml:id="pg_777" facs="0797"/>
                        <p>I cannot vouch for the accuracy of this story. As a matter of fact, Cao
                            was carrying out a helicopter operation when I met him, and he certainly
                            gave no indication of being frozen by fear of casualties. But I heard
                            similar comments by advisors in other Corps areas, which leads me to
                            think this is a real problem.</p>

                            on basis its own judgment of requirements and effects. Thus US does not

                            napalm on <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> territory any more than it

                            quantities napalm and, as in case of Zone D operation, had to call on us
                            for additional delivery capability. Thus, in terms use large amounts
                            napalm, US in fact has control and is exercising it.</p>
                        <p>Zone D operation constitutes first time <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> has proposed employ large quantities of napalm.
                            Question has not arisen in past and is unlikely arise often in future.
                            Regarding effects of using napalm on <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s ability gain support of populace, we aware reports that
                            during Indochina War napalm considered here as white colonialists'
                            weapon against yellow “natives”. However, we have no evidence of any
                            kind suggesting this attitude has been transferred to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s use of napalm. Nor do we have any
                            reason believe local people single out napalm or any other particular
                            weapon used by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> as reason for
                            supporting <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> or at least being
                                anti-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. While it true that Hanoi

                                “US-<persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>” of widespread and
                            inhumane use of napalm, and other weapons no evidence this line we have
                            has had effect in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> or that it has
                            been exploited outside <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>In Embassy's view, adverse political and psychological impact of napalm
                            on attitudes of population would differ from impact of other weapons
                            only to degree napalm more deadly as destroyer than rockets, bombs or
                            large or small arms. Believe question is therefore not so much use of
                            napalm as against use rockets or any other deadly weapon, but rather
                            degree discrimination and care applied in use of all weapons. As
                            indicated above, we are exercising discrimination and care in question
                            use of US aircraft for delivery large quantities napalm.</p>
                        <p>As for <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> use of stocks napalm and other
                            weapons of destruction, we must depend upon discrimination and care with
                            which <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> prosecutes this war in
                            accordance agreed objectives. Overall agreed policy objective is, of
                            course, to win the support of the people. The expeditious prosecution of
                            the war is a “sine qua non” of this. The overall objective, constantly
                            reiterated and discussed between <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and
                            US officials in many contexts, is, we think, becoming more and more
                            understood and adopted by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces.
                            This includes greater care and discrimination in target selection and in
                            the use of weapons. Since any lethal weapon is disliked and feared by
                            any enemy in direct proportion to its effectiveness, the use of napalm,
                            crop destroyers, high explosive bombs, claymore mines, and others will
                            predictably provoke protests from hostile propaganda forces.</p>
                        <p>With respect to last para reftel, COMUS <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> feels restraints already imposed are making it
                            difficult enough to carry the war to the heart of the enemy and tend to
                            set up inviolable sanctuaries where the VC can take a breather. In light
                            of the above explanations, and taking into consideration the need for
                            quick response and action in planning and execution of military
                            operations, I agree with General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> that requirement of last para reftel is not
                            necessary, and I request reconsideration. In any event, the instruction
                            is so imprecise (e.g., what is definition of large amounts) that we feel
                            discretion in this important matter should be left with Task Force
                                Saigon.<note n="4" xml:id="d329fn4">On December 21, the Embassy in

                        <p rend="center">SOUTHEAST ASIA—VIETNAM</p>
                        <p>We have problems of varying complexity with all of the nations in
                            Southeast Asia. Clearly, however, the critical focus is south Viet Nam.
                            Developments there in the next two or three years may well influence
                            greatly the trends in the whole region for the following ten or
                            twenty.</p>
                        <p>And at this point it is far from certain what will develop in Viet Nam.
                            One thing is reasonably clear: From somewhere about 1956 or '57, the
                            unusual combination of factors which had resulted in the establishment
                            of the Republic under <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Ngo Dinh
                                Diem</persName> began to lose its impulse. A drift set in at about
                            that time, responsibility for which is only partially ascribable to the
                            shortcomings of the Vietnamese government. Our aid programs, military
                            and non-military, after all, were one of the principal sources of the
                            origin and the continuance of that government's power and these were
                            properly open to charges of being ill-conceived and badly administered.
                            They did little with the time which was bought at Geneva in the sense of
                            stimulating the growth of indigenous roots for the political structure
                            in Saigon. That structure is, today, far more dependent on us for its
                            existence than it was five years ago. If Vietnam is the cork in the
                            Southeast Asian bottle then American aid is more than ever the cork in
                            the Vietnamese bottle.</p>
                        <p>We have now had for some months new concepts and a new American approach
                            in Viet Nam. But the purpose of both remains, in essentials, what the
                            purpose of other approaches have been from the outset. Indeed, it was
                            distressing on this visit to hear the situation described in much the
                            same terms as on my last visit although it is seven years and billions
                            of dollars later. Viet Nam, outside the cities, is still an insecure
                            place which is run at least at night largely by the Vietcong. The
                            government in Saigon is still seeking acceptance by the ordinary people
                            in large areas of the countryside. Out of fear or indifference or
                            hostility the peasants still withhold acquiescence, let alone approval
                            of that government. In short, it would be well to face the fact that we
                            are once again at the beginning of the beginning. </p>
                        <p>But as noted there are now new concepts and a new American approach. The
                            new concepts, as undoubtedly you are aware, center on the strategic
                            hamlets. The new approach involves the re-oriented and <pb n="780" xml:id="pg_780" facs="0800"/>expanded economic aid program and the
                            use of many thousands of supporting American military personnel as well
                            as the special forces which are concentrating their efforts on the
                            tribal people, the Montagnards.</p>
                        <p>Although the first results have scarcely been registered, the evaluations
                            of the new approach—Vietnamese and American—in Saigon are extremely
                            optimistic. Those bearing responsibility—Vietnamese and American—speak
                            of success in the solution of the problem in terms of a year or two.</p>
                        <p>Having heard optimistic predictions of this kind, with the introduction
                            of other “new concepts,” beginning with French General Navarre in Hanoi
                            in 1953, certain reservations seem to me to be in order. It is true that
                            Vietminh casualty counts have been rising but the accuracy of these
                            counts is open to question. Moreover, it should be noted that the
                            estimates of Vietcong core strength have also been rising. The total of
                            20,000 which is now calculated at <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> is the highest which I have ever encountered since
                            the Geneva accords of 1954.</p>
                        <p>Responsible Americans in Saigon believe that exceptional progress has
                            been made in winning over the Montagnards by the special forces. This is
                            an important achievement because the location of these tribal people has
                            considerable strategic significance in terms of north-south supply
                            trails. But it should also be recognized that in terms of the major
                            struggle the Montagnards are peripheral. In the last analysis, the
                            Saigon government will stand or fall on the basis not of the several
                            hundred thousand primitive Montagnards, but the millions of Vietnamese
                            in the villages, towns and cities.</p>
                        <p>Apart from these two tangibles—higher Vietminh casualties and progress in
                            winning over the Montagnards—there are also reports of improvements in
                            the security of road travel and in the movement of rice and other
                            commodities out of the countryside into the cities. These are excellent
                            indicators of progress but the reports are not yet conclusive as to
                            trends.</p>
                        <p>At this point, therefore, the optimistic predictions of success must be
                            regarded as deriving primarily from the development of the theory of the
                            strategic hamlets by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh
                                Nhu</persName> and by the injection of new energy which has been
                            provided by additional American aid and personnel. The real tests are
                            yet to come.</p>
                        <p>Reservations are in order because in the first place, the rapid success
                            of the concept of the strategic hamlet would seem to depend on the
                            assumption that the Vietminh will remain wedded to their present tactics
                            and will be unable to devise significant and effective revisions to meet
                            the new concepts and the new highly mobile firepower of the
                            American-trained forces. That may be the case but it would be unwise to
                            underestimate the resourcefulness of any group which has managed to
                            survive years of the most rugged kind of <pb n="781" xml:id="pg_781" facs="0801"/>warfare. In the second place, rapid success of the new
                            concepts depends upon the assumption that the great bulk of the people
                            in the countryside sustain the Vietminh merely out of fear or, at best,
                            indifference. There is really no effective measure of the accuracy of
                            this assumption. It may indeed contain a good deal of truth but the
                            critical question is how much truth. The temptation to extrapolate our
                            own reactions on to the Vietnamese peasant in this kind of a situation
                            is as obvious as it is dangerous.</p>
                        <p>The fact is that only experience and the most acute observation and
                            objective reporting will throw real light on the accuracy of this
                            assumption. To date we have not had enough of any of those essential
                            ingredients of sound judgment. If experience should prove that there is
                            less rather than more truth in the assumption that fear or indifference
                            are the keystones of the Vietcong hold over the countryside, the target
                            date for success will be delayed indefinitely beyond the year or two of
                            the present predictions.</p>
                        <p>This is not to say that even a serious error in this assumption renders
                            success impossible. If we were prepared to increase the commitment of
                            men and military aid to compensate for the error it is not impossible
                            that the concept of the strategic hamlet could still be brought into
                            existence, in time, despite widespread support of the peasants for the
                            Vietcong. And if the Vietnamese government, with more aid, could then
                            turn the secured hamlets into a significantly more satisfactory way of
                            life than the peasants have known, then it is conceivable that a deep
                            disaffection towards the Vietcong could be induced. But it would be well
                            to recognize that any such reorientation involves an immense job of
                            social engineering, dependent on great outlays of aid on our part for
                            many years and a most responsive, alert and enlightened leadership in
                            the government of Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Even assuming that aid over a prolonged period would be available, the
                            question still remains as to the capacity of the present Saigon
                            government to carry out the task of social engineering. <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> remains a dedicated,
                            sincere, hardworking, incorruptible and patriotic leader. But he is
                            older and the problems which confront him are more complex than those
                            which he faced when he pitted his genuine nationalism against, first,
                            the French and Bao Dai and then against the sects with such
                            effectiveness. The energizing role which he played in the past appears
                            to be passing to other members of his family, particularly to <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName>. The latter is a person of
                            great energy and intellect who is fascinated by the operations of
                            political power and has consummate eagerness and ability in organizing
                            and manipulating it. But it is <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Ngo Dinh
                                Diem</persName>, not <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh
                                Nhu</persName>, who has such popular mandate to exercise power as
                            there is in south Vietnam. In a situation of this kind there is a great
                            danger of the corruption of unbridled power. This has implications far
                            beyond the persistent reports <pb n="782" xml:id="pg_782" facs="0802"/>and rumors of fiscal and similar irregularities which are, in any
                            event, undocumented. More important is its effect on the organization of
                            the machinery for carrying out the new concepts. The difficulties in
                            Vietnam are not likely to be overcome by a handful of paid retainers and
                            sycophants. The success of the new approach in Vietnam presupposes a
                            great contribution of initiative and self-sacrifice from a substantial
                            body of Vietnamese with capacities for leadership at all levels. Whether
                            that contribution can be obtained remains to be seen. For in the last
                            analysis it depends upon a diffusion of political power, essentially in
                            a democratic pattern. The trends in the political life of Vietnam have
                            not been until now in that direction despite lip service to the theory
                            of developing democratic and popular institutions “from the bottom up”
                            through the strategic hamlet program.</p>
                        <p>To summarize, our policies and activities are designed to meet an
                            existing set of internal problems in south Vietnam. North Vietnam
                            infiltrates some supplies and cadres into the south; together with the
                            Vietnamese we are trying to shut off this flow. The Vietcong has had the
                            offensive in guerrilla warfare in the countryside; we are attempting to
                            aid the Vietnamese military in putting them on the defensive with the
                            hope of eventually reducing them at least to ineffectiveness. Finally,
                            the Vietnamese peasants have sustained the Vietcong guerrillas out of
                            fear, indifference or blandishment and we are helping the Vietnamese in
                            an effort to win the peasants away by offering them the security and
                            other benefits which may be provided in the strategic hamlets.</p>
                        <p>That, in brief, is the present situation. As noted, there is optimism
                            that success will be achieved quickly. My own view is that the problems
                            can be made to yield to present remedies, <hi rend="italic">provided</hi> the problems and their magnitude do not change
                            significantly and <hi rend="italic">provided</hi> that the remedies are
                            pursued by both Vietnamese and Americans (and particularly the former)
                            with great vigor and self-dedication.</p>
                        <p>Certainly, if these remedies do not work, it is difficult to conceive of
                            alternatives, with the possible exception of a truly massive commitment
                            of American military personnel and other resources—in short going to war
                            fully ourselves against the guerrillas—and the establishment of some
                            form of neocolonial rule in south Vietnam. That is an alternative which
                            I most emphatically do not recommend. On the contrary, it seems to me
                            most essential that we make crystal clear to the Vietnamese government
                            and to our own people that while we will go to great lengths to help,
                            the primary responsibility rests with the Vietnamese. Our role is and
                            must remain secondary in present circumstances. It is their country,
                            their future which is most at stake, not ours.</p>
                        <p>To ignore that reality will not only be immensely costly in terms of
                            American lives and resources but it may also draw us inexorably into
                            some variation of the unenviable position in Vietnam which was <pb n="783" xml:id="pg_783" facs="0803"/>formerly occupied by the
                            French. We are not, of course, at that point at this time. But the great
                            increase in American military commitment this year has tended to point
                            us in that general direction and we may well begin to slide rapidly
                            toward it if any of the present remedies begin to falter in
                            practice.</p>
                        <p>As indicated, our planning appears to be predicated on the assumption
                            that existing internal problems in south Vietnam will remain about the
                            same and can be overcome by greater effort and better techniques. But
                            what if the problems do not remain the same? To all outward appearances,
                            little if any thought has been given in Saigon, at least, to the
                            possibilities of a change in the nature of the problems themselves.
                            Nevertheless, they are very real possibilities and the initiative for
                            instituting change rests in enemy hands largely because of the weakness
                            of the Saigon government. The range of possible change includes a
                            step-up in the infiltration of cadres and supplies by land or sea. It
                            includes the use of part or all of the regular armed forces of north
                            Vietnam, reported to be about 300,000 strong, under Vo Nguyen Giap. It
                            includes, in the last analysis, the possibility of a major increase in
                            any of many possible forms of Chinese Communist support for the
                            Vietcong.</p>
                        <p>None of these possibilities may materialize. It would be folly, however,
                            not to recognize their existence and to have as much clarification in
                            advance of what our response to them will be if they do.</p>
                        <p>This sort of anticipatory thinking cannot be undertaken with respect to
                            the situation in Vietnam alone. The problem there can be grasped, it
                            seems to me, only as we have clearly in mind our interests with respect
                            to all of Southeast Asia. If it is essential in our interests to
                            maintain a quasi-permanent position of power on the Asian mainland as
                            against the Chinese then we must be prepared to continue to pay the
                            present cost in Vietnam indefinitely and to meet any escalation on the
                            other side with at least a commensurate escalation of commitment of our
                            own. This can go very far, indeed, in terms of lives and resources. Yet
                            if it is essential to our interests then we would have no choice.</p>
                        <p>But if on the other hand it is, at best, only desirable rather than
                            essential that a position of power be maintained on the mainland, then
                            other courses are indicated. We would, then, properly view such
                            improvement as may be obtained by the new approach in Vietnam primarily
                            in terms of what it might contribute to strengthening our diplomatic
                            hand in the Southeast Asian region. And we would use that hand as
                            vigorously as possible and in every way possible not to deepen our
                            costly involvement on the Asian mainland but to lighten it.</p>
                        <p>It is uncertain what the prospects for doing so may be, even if we were
                            inclined to the latter course. The experience in Laos which, in effect,
                            is an essay in that direction is not cause for sanguine expectation.<pb n="784" xml:id="pg_784" facs="0804"/> On the one hand, there are the
                            anticipated difficulties with the Pathet Lao. Their leader in Vientiane,
                            Prince Souphanovong, is brilliant and capable but he is also hard-bitten
                            and relentless. His relations with <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna
                                Phouma</persName> are delicate and uncertain and there are reports
                            that even the limited degree of cooperation which he has extended has
                            come under attack from his own faction. The cooperation with <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna Phouma</persName> from the other Laotian
                            group headed by <persName corresp="#p_PN3">Phoumi Nosavan</persName>
                            has also been circumscribed and uncertain.</p>
                        <p>These difficulties, of course, were to be anticipated and much depends on
                                <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna Phouma</persName> if they are to
                            be surmounted. It is our policy to support him fully and the American
                            Ambassador is making a noble effort to carry out that policy. The latter
                            needs and must have the cooperation of all departments in this effort.
                            Moreover, his views as to what is necessary should be most carefully
                            regarded in the design of his instructions. This point needs stressing,
                            for one has the distinct impression in Laos that a great deal of
                            executive branch energy is going into the preparation for contingencies
                            in anticipation of the failure of the policy of neutralization under

                            into making the policy work. The job will be sufficiently difficult even
                            in the best of circumstances and it is not at all unlikely that
                                <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna Phouma</persName> may tire of it
                            and abandon it unless the efforts of every department and agency of our
                            own government which may be involved are bent energetically to the
                            achievement of our policy under the direction of the Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>If Laos does not yet offer much hope of an eventual lightening of our
                            burdens throughout Southeast Asia, Cambodia stands in stark contrast.
                            Its internal stability is exceptional for contemporary Southeast Asia.
                            It is led by Prince Sihanouk with dedication, energy and astuteness. And
                            it has made steady and most impressive social and economic progress in
                            the past few years. It is an illustration of what can be achieved in the
                            lush lands of the region in conditions of peace, with a vigorous and
                            progressive indigenous leadership and a judicious and limited use of
                            outside aid. It is also an experience which can shed light on the
                            possibilities of eventually lightening our burdens in Southeast Asia. </p>
                        <p>For that reason if for no other, it seems to me essential that we go very
                            far in attempting to find practicable solutions which will meet the
                            Cambodian desire for reassurance that it will not be overwhelmed from
                            either Vietnam on the east or Thailand on the west. Cambodian fears
                            exist. They are probably excessive fears at least in present
                            circumstances. Nevertheless, they are powerful and deeply felt fears
                            based in part on history and it would be most unwise to underestimate
                            their potential influence on Cambodian policy. It would be most
                            unfortunate if they pushed Cambodia further in the direction of
                            China.</p>
                        <pb n="785" xml:id="pg_785" facs="0805"/>
                        <p>Our relations with this little country have been, to say the least,
                            erratic from the outset and, it seems to me, largely unnecessarily so.
                            There have been unfortunate clashes of personality, lack of
                            understanding and even more serious matters involved. Official relations
                            now seem to me to be well-handled and insofar as we may be responsible
                            for such strains as exist, they would appear ascribable to policy as it
                            is formulated in Washington not as it is administered in Phnom Penh.</p>
                        <p>The Cambodians are apparently prepared for a further reduction in the
                            remaining one-sided aid commitment which has already been reduced
                            considerably. We should welcome this opportunity and at the same time
                            seek to broaden mutually advantageous relationships. The key to bringing
                            about this transition without alienating Cambodia is to be found in its
                            interrelationships and ours with its neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam. It
                            is, in my opinion, clearly desirable to search vigorously for this
                            key.</p>
                        <p>It is apparent that in Thailand, the bent of our policy with respect not
                            only to Cambodia but to Laos as well is not appreciated and, at best,
                            enjoys only a grudging tolerance. Cambodia is held in low esteem and the
                            resentments over the recent adverse International Court decision still
                            smolder.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Laos, the Thais have either not wanted the policy of
                            neutralization to work or have not believed that it would work from the
                            outset. They are still clearly skeptical. It is probable that once it
                            became clear that we would not commit ourselves militarily to the
                            recapture of all of Laos, the Thais preferred a solution by military
                            partition rather than the attempt at neutralization, with the United
                            States committed to the defense of at least southern Laos. This may
                            still be their expectation.</p>
                        <p>American actions in Thailand appear to support the Thai skepticism at
                            least to the point of providing heavily for contingencies in the event
                            neutralization fails in Laos. Several new jet-ports have been built in
                            eastern Thailand. In the recent withdrawal of the American combat unit,
                            a great deal of heavy transport equipment, particularly for fuel, has
                            been left behind. And, finally, the United States military command
                            intends to put back into Thailand in the near future, a contingent of
                            forces about equal in number to those being withdrawn for the purpose of
                            constructing a fuel pipe line across that country.</p>
                        <p>The cost of these various operations when added to the already immense
                            and continuing input of aid of various kinds is cause for serious
                            concern. Thailand is relatively prosperous. It has a very substantial
                            foreign trade from which other nations such as Japan and Western Germany
                            profit greatly along with Thailand. There is talk of aid from other
                            sources but it is almost entirely talk of aid on a loan or trade basis,
                            with a clear expectation of direct and tangible returns to <pb n="786" xml:id="pg_786" facs="0806"/>the donors. At the same time, we are
                            carrying, virtually, the entire burden of aid for Thailand's defense and
                            other purposes which carry little in the way of tangible return. This
                            sort of an arrangement leaves us with the onerous burdens while others
                            reap the fruits.</p>
                        <p>It is an arrangement that will probably be continued as long as we are
                            prepared to countenance it. Sudden changes in our willingness to sustain
                            these burdens might produce serious adverse consequences. But it seems
                            to me that a constant pressure must be maintained to bring about a
                            progressive reduction in our commitment by having the Thais themselves
                            and others take on more of the onerous burdens. That pressure is not in
                            evidence in our policies and their administration at the present
                            time.</p>
                        <p>Elsewhere in Southeast Asia, in Burma and in Malaya, we have a minimum of
                            commitment. In the case of Burma, this fortuitous state of affairs would
                            appear to be largely one of Burmese choice. The Burmese have settled the
                            border question with China along the McCarthy line (an extension of the
                            McMahon line) and to their satisfaction. They are fumed inward in their
                            attitudes, seeking only to stay clear of the India-China dispute. They
                            are also fearful of antagonizing China by too dose dealings with us. But
                            there is no assurance that in the future a Burmese government,
                            hard-pressed to maintain itself in an internal political situation which
                            is never far from chaos, will not seek substantial aid from the United
                            States. It seems to me that we must steel ourselves against that day.
                            And, in all honesty, it seems to me that the key to staying clear of
                            still another costly commitment on the Asian mainland is to be found in
                            restraining our own bureaucratic eagerness to help.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Malaya, except for a large and expanding Peace Corps, we
                            are maintaining relatively orthodox and inexpensive relationships with a
                            minimum of commitment on our part. However, this excellent state of
                            affairs may be strained by the effort to bring Malaysia into existence.
                            It is probable that the British hope, by the unification of Malaya,
                            Singapore, Brunei, Sarawak, and North Borneo, to lighten their burdens
                            in that region while retaining as much as possible of their influence
                            and their highly profitable economic position.</p>
                        <p>Without criticizing this attempt, it should be noted that our approach
                            must be one of the greatest delicacy, primarily because of the attitudes
                            of the Philippines. There are already indications of a measure of
                            collaboration developing between the Philippines and Indonesia in
                            resisting the formation of Malaysia. It is a collaboration which we
                            should do nothing to stimulate by inadvertent statements or actions.</p>
                        <p>It is likely that Malaysia will come into existence some time next year.
                            There are already feelers being put out for the establishment of an aid
                            program from the United States. It seems to me, again, that we must
                            resist this effort to deepen our commitment and, again, the key is <pb n="787" xml:id="pg_787" facs="0807"/>to put restraints on our own
                            bureaucratic eagernesses. It is one thing to provide loans to a nation
                            such as Malaysia which is clearly a good risk or to send Peace Corpsmen
                            to the remote areas of Brunei, Sarawak and North Borneo where a little
                            technical knowledge can go a long way. But it is quite another thing to
                            take on major and continuing tasks of military organization and supply
                            and the internal development of still one more country in Southeast
                            Asia, responsibilities which we assume in name at least and also to some
                            degree in fact, every time we establish these aid-missions. It would
                            seem appropriate that any continuing aid to Malaysia should remain the
                            responsibility of the U.K. and the Commonwealth rather than being
                            shifted to the United States.</p>
                        <p>Viewing Southeast Asia as a whole, the situation is one of varying
                            conditions of stability. The future of freedom in the area is far from
                            certain. Except for some significant and effective French efforts in
                            Cambodia and Commonwealth efforts in the Malayan situation, the
                            principal externally borne burdens fall upon us.</p>
                        <p>If we were to withdraw abruptly from beneath these burdens, there would
                            be a major collapse in many places and what would follow is by no means
                            certain. Obviously, much would depend upon the capacity and urge of the
                            Chinese to move into the vacuum.</p>
                        <p>We cannot afford to withdraw suddenly from these burdens. While we must
                            make every effort to have others share them, we would, I believe, be
                            deluding ourselves if we expected very much help from other outside
                            sources in the near future.</p>
                        <p>The real question which confronts us, therefore, is how much are we
                            ourselves prepared to put into Southeast Asia and for how long in order
                            to serve such interests as we may have in that region? Before we can
                            answer this question, we must reassess our interests, using the words
                            “vital” or “essential” with the greatest realism and restraint in the
                            reassessment. When that has been done, we will be in a better position
                            to estimate what we must, in fact, expend in the way of scarce
                            resources, energy and lives in order to preserve those interests. We may
                            well discover that it is in our interests to do less rather than more
                            than we are now doing. If that is the case, we will do well to
                            concentrate on a vigorous diplomacy which would be designed to lighten
                            our commitments without bringing about sudden and catastrophic upheavals
                            in Southeast Asia.</p>

                            advertised as a once-and-for-all nationwide offensive—is, we believe, a
                            sound means of using to the fullest one of our major resources in the
                            overall counterinsurgency operation.</p>
                        <p>There is no detailed plan of operations as yet. Such a plan will only be
                            developed as VC strongholds and units throughout the country are
                            identified and marked by intelligence and operahona1 reconnaissance.
                            After this has been done, there will be an effort to strike these
                            strongholds and units simultaneously insofar as possible. There is no
                            thought that this will be a one-time operation: what is involved is
                            moving to a higher intensity of operations which it is recognized may
                            have to be continued indefinitely. The emphasis will not be on large
                            operations but rather on simultaneous or consecutive attacks on
                            identified <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> units with the forces
                            required for each. There is no possibility, we recognize, of achieving
                            strategic surprise. There is no thought <pb n="789" xml:id="pg_789" facs="0809"/>of diverting resources from clear-and-hold operations
                            or the Strategic Hamlet Program. On the contrary, a fuller employment of
                            available forces should bring more rapid progress in overall
                            pacification.</p>
                        <p>In short, I believe this concept is sound and psychologically necessary
                            at this juncture. The concerns registered in reftel we have very much in
                            mind and will try to guard against them. This is not meant to be a
                            dramatic operation but it appears timely and necessary in the near
                            future to spur on a sustained, vigorous offensive. The forces and
                            organization on our side are ready for this, or nearly so, and the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are hurting. I feel strongly that
                            we should not hold back from trying to exploit these factors to the
                            utmost.</p>
                        <p>In conversation with <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> today
                            touching on this question, I gathered that he is also thinking in the
                            terms indicated above, and that, having achieved something in the nature
                            of a national mobilization, he too is eager to pursue the present
                            advantage.</p>
                        <p>To be clear, I should like to repeat that we should be very careful not
                            to bill this concept or operation as the final climax of the struggle
                            here.</p>

                        <p>The strategic concept for South Vietnam calls for military, political,
                            economic, and social actions on such a scale and so coordinated as to
                            constitute a national response to the Viet Cong challenge. Broadly, the
                            concept calls for:</p>
                        <pb n="790" xml:id="pg_790" facs="0810"/>
                        <p>1) developing military and para-military counterguerrilla
                            capabilities;</p>
                        <p>2) separating and protecting the population from the Viet Cong, and</p>
                        <p>3) applying the political, economic, and social measures necessary to
                            convert military successes into political gains.</p>
                        <p>There appears to be no reason as yet to question the soundness of the
                            concept. But there is a very real question as to how well and
                            wholeheartedly it is being put into effect. The purpose of this paper is
                            to assess the implementation of the concept during 1962.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Counterguerrilla Capabilities</p>
                        <p>This phase of the concept is relatively separable and non-political and
                            the one in which direct US aid and advice play the largest role.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Progress</p>
                        <p>There has been notable progress in improving counterguerrilla
                            capabilities, largely as a direct result of US military aid and
                            advice.</p>
                        <p>—Vietnam's forces are now supplied with the weapons and instructed in the
                            tactics suitable for counterguerrilla warfare.</p>
                        <p>—US helicopters and radios have vastly improved Vietnamese tachca1
                            mobility.</p>
                        <p>—Vietnamese forces are beginning to engage the Viet Cong in small-unit
                            achons. Night operations, though skill limited, are increasing.</p>
                        <p>—Nearly 2,000 US-trained Montagnards are now conducting armed patrols
                            designed to provide intelligence and, to some extent, to interdict Viet
                            Cong access routes through Laos.</p>
                        <p>—Self Defense Corps and Civil Guard units have been roughly doubled in
                            the past year and are being further expanded in order to provide local
                            defense to the strategic hamlets.</p>
                        <p>—During September and October, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            forces were able for the first time to capture more weapons from the
                            Viet Cong than they lost</p>

                        <p>These increased capabilities, however, have not yet been exploited as
                            effectively as they might be.</p>
                        <p>—<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> military forces continue to rely
                            heavily on large-scale operations and conventional tactics.</p>
                        <p>—Excessive use of air strikes in the absence of ground contact with the
                            enemy continues to kill a lot of innocent peasants.</p>
                        <p>—Inadequate delegation of authority and political interference by the
                            Vietnamese leadership has restricted initiative in the field.</p>
                        <p>—Independent and offensive deployment of Civil Guard and <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> units has weakened strategic hamlet
                            defense and produced heavy casualties.</p>

                        <p>Establishment of strategic hamlets and systematic military-political
                            pacification are distinct but necessarily integrated phases of the
                            strategic concept. The purpose of these measures is to isolate and
                            protect the peasants from the Communists, to gain their support in the
                            counterguerrilla effort, and, ultimately, to produce lasting political
                            and socio-economic gains at the local level.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Progress</p>
                        <p>The government has given high priority to the strategic hamlet program
                            which since March has been progressively infused with a systematic
                            military-political pacification effort.</p>
                        <p>—According to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, more than 3,500
                            strategic hamlets have been completed, more than 2,000 are under
                            construction. The current rate of construction is 300-400 a month. It is
                            not certain, however, how much of the strategic hamlet program has been
                            carried out. In many, nothing seems to have been done but to construct a
                            barbed wire or bamboo fence.</p>
                        <p>—The hamlets have become a major Viet Cong target, suggesting that Viet
                            Cong feel that their access to the people is being threatened. However,
                            we cannot generalize about the success with which hamlets have withstood
                            Viet Cong attacks.</p>
                        <p>—In March 1962 President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>
                            approved the “Delta Pacification Plan”<note n="2" xml:id="d332fn2">See
                                    <ref target="#d51">Document 51</ref>.</note> which provides for
                            a systematic military-political pacification of eleven provinces
                            integrated with the strategic hamlet program. Similar plans have since
                            been drawn up for individual provinces elsewhere. Pacification
                            operations are actually in progress in six provinces—Binh Duong
                            (Operation Sunrise, later expanded to parts of Tay Ninh and Phuoc Tuy),
                            Phu Yen (Operation Sea Swallow), Binh Dinh (Operation Let's Go), and
                            Quang Ngai (Operation Royal Phoenix). Plans for four more provinces
                            (Vinh Long, Dinh Tuong, Vinh Binh, and Long An) have recently been
                            approved.</p>
                        <p>—Preliminary results of the integrated pacification programs are
                            encouraging. The strategic hamlets in these areas are generally well
                            organized and defended. Considerable effort is being devoted to
                            follow-up social and political measures aimed at improving the lot of
                            the peasants and developing their identification with the government's
                            counterinsurgency effort. Peasant discontent over mistreatment, forced
                            labor, and probably inadequate compensation has been reduced perceptibly
                            in recent operations.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Problems</p>
                        <p>However, the hamlet program on the whole has been precipitous and
                            uncoordinated and the pacification plans slow to be implemented.</p>
                        <pb n="792" xml:id="pg_792" facs="0812"/>
                        <p>—Vietnamese leadership looks upon the strategic hamlet program as a
                            panacea, and there is skill considerable confusion among local officials
                            as to the objectives of the program and procedures for implementing
                            it.</p>
                        <p>—Strategic hamlets have been and are still being thrown together in the
                            absence of a coordinated pacification effort, such as conceived in the
                            Delta Plan, and with only perfunctory attention to defense, social,
                            economic, and administrative improvements. In spite of government
                            efforts to maintain standards and to provide personnel to administer
                            such hamlets effectively, many are inadequately defended and few are
                            providing benefits to the peasants.</p>
                        <p>—Pacification operations have been applied to only six of the South
                            Vietnam's 41 provinces and have been completed in none. Although
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> formally assigned top
                            priority to the Delta Plan provinces in August, he has failed-probably
                            for political reasons-to subordinate the strategic hamlet program to the
                            Delta Plan and, indeed, to the general pacification effort itself.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Assessment</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has developed an effective
                            strategic concept for counterinsurgency and has in fact mounted a
                            nabona1 effort to implement it. The principal defects appear to arise
                            mainly from improper emphasis applied to various aspects of the
                            concept.</p>
                        <p>—The Army has overemphasized large-scale actions and the use of artillery
                            and airpower, as compared with small-unit actions and intelligence
                            collections. Although emphasis on patrols and ambushes appears to be
                            increasing, continued and excessive use of air power and crop
                            destruction-however well controlled-may well develop a militant
                            opposition from the peasants and their positive identification with the
                            Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>—The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has overemphasized the

                            into integrated military-political pacification efforts.</p>

                            of much of its impact. Much depends on the ability of the government to
                            show convincing evidence of its intent to improve the lot of the
                            peasants. Instead, government efforts appear to be aimed largely at
                            increasing government control over the peasants.</p>

                        <p>I attach a memorandum from Secretary Gilpatric to you recommending an
                            increase in the U.S. air capability in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The memorandum also recommends an investigation of the possibility of
                            obtaining Chinese Nationalist pilots to fly C-47 aircraft for the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. I understand that they are to be used
                            only on transport missions thus releasing the <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> pilots now so engaged for combat. Although there are a
                            number of Chinese Nationalists working for the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, none are pilots.</p>
                        <p>Despite his worries about increasing U.S. military presence in South
                            Vietnam at this time and the use of air power for strategic attacks on
                            targets which are not clearly identified as solely Viet Cong, Governor
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> approves Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName>'s proposal.
                            Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> believes that
                            the proposal is justified, because close-in air support to the increased
                            activities of the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> in defending
                            strategic hamlets is essential to the success of the program.</p>
                        <p>We are still very sensitive to the necessity of assuring that air strike
                            targets are selected so as to minimize the adverse political
                            consequences of killing uncommitted peasants. This is one of the
                            problems which <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Roger Hilsman</persName> and myself will try to look into during our

                        <p>1. The Joint Chiefs of Staff and I have reviewed two requests from the
                            Commander in Chief, Pacific, both of which are related to providing
                            additional combat air capability in support of military operations in
                            South Vietnam (SVN). The first is a request for early augmentation of
                            Farmgate by 18 aircraft (5 T-28s, 11 B-26s, 2 C-47s) and 117 <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> personnel (95 combat, 22 air base
                            support). Farmgate is the current code name of the Air Force Jungle Jim
                            Squadron that you authorized on 11 October 1961 to be introduced into
                                Vietnam.<note n="4" xml:id="d333fn4">See <ref target="frus1961-63v01#d156">

                                    Document 156</ref>.</note> The second request is for approval to
                            initiate talks with the Government of Vietnam (<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>) on the subject of the use of Chinese Nationalists as
                            Vietnamese Air Force C-47 pilots.</p>
                        <p>2. A review of operations by the Republic of Vietnam Armed Forces (<gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>) and paramilitary forces for the
                            past six months shows that practically all ground actions now are
                            coordinated with some air support effort. This has resulted in
                            continually increasing requirements for air support. Appreciation of the
                            role of air support by the Vietnamese is evidenced by the increasing
                            numbers of combat missions flown the past several months in support of
                            convoys, strategic hamlet defense, heliborne assault, interdiction,
                            conventional ground operations, and paramilitary operations. In
                            September 1962, the Vietnam Air Force (VNAF) fighter aircraft flew 620
                            combat sorties as compared with 150 combat sorties the previous January.
                            This increase dramatically illustrates the growth in the number of air
                            support sorties. The impact of these increasing requests for air support
                            has been so great that requirements exceed the combined capabilities of
                            the VNAF and Farmgate. In fact, <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> states:</p>
                        <p>“We are daily losing opportunities to destroy Viet Cong due to inability
                            of VNAF to answer valid requests for air strikes. This situation results
                            primarily from VNAF pilot shortage. Farmgate pilots are being overflown
                            averaging 100 hours per month and cannot fill the gap.”</p>
                        <pb n="795" xml:id="pg_795" facs="0815"/>
                        <p>Farmgate, and for all practical purposes the VNAF, has reached optimum
                            operating capabilities. Their combined efforts are not able to fill all
                            valid requests for air support.</p>
                        <p>3. During the next several months, which <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> states will be critical, the need for air support
                            is expected to continue to increase because of the following
                            factors:</p>
                        <p>a. Increase in offensive operations as the Vietnamese forces continue to
                            become more active and aggressive.</p>
                        <p>b. The addition of the ninth division to the Army by the end of 1962, and
                            the steadily expanding capabilities of the Civil Guard and Self Defense
                            Corps.</p>
                        <p>c. Increased number of air mobile operations made possible by the recent
                            addition of two helicopter companies.</p>
                        <p>d. Support of President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s
                            nation-wide offensive planned for early 1963.</p>
                        <p>e. Expansion of the Citizens Irregular Defense Groups and paramilitary
                            programs.</p>
                        <p>f. Improvement in weather which favors military operations supportable by
                            air.</p>
                        <p>4. In addition to the above, General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> visualizes dispersal of certain strike teams for
                            air support into three areas of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.
                            This decentralization is designed to provide an air strike capability in
                            each of these areas and thereby decrease the reaction time for air
                            support. In the past, the majority of Farmgate aircraft have been
                            concentrated in the Saigon area due to limitations in maintenance,
                            availability of pilots, and equipment. As a result, penalties have been
                            paid in terms of targets lost and slow reaction times. The dispersal of
                            strike teams will alleviate this problem, but at the same time will
                            increase the requirement for facilities, pilots, and equipment to
                            accomplish the air support role. Therefore, to meet increasing
                            requirements for air support which will be necessitated by the foregoing
                            developments, additional air support capability is needed now in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>5. The continual growth of coordinated ground and air operations induced
                            by the increasing numbers of heliborne operations and the steady
                            increase of air support capabilities in SVN over the past year has been
                            instrumental in producing a unifying effect within the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>. Prior to the influx of air
                            support/heliborne operations, military planning on the part of the
                            Vietnamese forces basically was isolated, noncoordinated, “do what you
                            can” action with very little rapport between the armed forces and other
                            elements of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. With the continuing
                            growth of air capability, there has been a marked improvement in
                            coordinated military planning and in the use of all national resources.
                            Significantly, the growth of air support and <pb n="796" xml:id="pg_796" facs="0816"/>heliborne operations has given U.S. advisors a firm
                            entree into <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> planning and has
                            resulted in a marked increase in military initiative and successes. This
                            entree must continue to be exploited.</p>
                        <p>6. The Joint Chiefs of Staff and I have reviewed the requirement for air
                            support in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. It is our opinion that
                            the requirement will increase in the next few months as set forth by
                                <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> and that every
                            reasonable effort should be expended to insure that adequate and timely
                            air support is available for current military and paramilitary
                            operations as well as for the planned nation-wide offensive. Recognizing
                            the concern over direct U.S. commitment in SVN, we have examined a
                            number of possible solutions. It is considered that actions now underway
                            to increase VNAF pilot training and aircraft equipage ultimately will
                            make possible the desired reductions in direct U.S. commitment. Programs
                            are now underway to increase Vietnamese student pilot training and to
                            provide additional combat aircraft phased with the expanded pilot output
                            which will result. Currently student pilots total 131 for fixed wing
                            aircraft and 66 for helicopters. In about 12 months it may be possible
                            to reduce U.S. participation in combat close support operations
                            (Farmgate) as this new group of Vietnamese pilots becomes operationally
                            ready. The extent of this reduction will depend on the extent of the
                            need for Farmgate aircraft to train the VNAF in special tactics and on
                            the number of valid air support requests as ground operations expand in
                            the coming months. <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> does not
                            at this time foresee a need for further Farmgate augmentation beyond
                            that recommended herein.</p>
                        <p>7. In the judgment of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, however, the overriding
                            conclusion is that an immediate increase in the air support capability
                            is needed and should be provided without losing sight of the necessity
                            for continuing to increase the capability of the VNAF to fill Vietnamese
                            air support requirements. From our review of possible methods of
                            increasing air support capabilities immediately, we conclude that the
                            most favorable options are those recommended by <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>: immediate augmentation of
                            Farmgate as outlined in paragraph 1 and introduction of 30 Chinese
                            Nationalist pilots. We anticipate that the latter could not be realized
                            as an increase in <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> capabilities
                            earlier than four months after initiating discussions with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>8. Therefore, I recommend that you approve the augmentation of Farmgate
                            as requested by <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> and
                            initiation of discussions with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            on the possible use of 30 Chinese Nationalist pilots to fly <pb n="797" xml:id="pg_797" facs="0817"/>transport aircraft in the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>. The Department of State concurs in

                                Reactions After Visiting Viet-Nam</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>According to Frank Meloy, who accompanied Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> on his recent visit to
                            Viet-Nam, the Senator's chief impressions of the Viet-Nam situation are
                            as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> still believes
                            that <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> is personally
                            incorruptible. He sees no alternative to <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>, and feels we must continue our present policy.
                            However the Senator was disappointed by <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName>'s two and one-half hour monologue during which the
                            Senator got the impression that <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> is a good deal older and more withdrawn from
                            reality than when he last saw him. The Senator was a little miffed
                            because <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> insisted upon
                            recounting the whole history of his regime as though the Senator were a
                            stranger to the Viet-Nam situation. The Senator also got the impression
                            that the <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Nhu</persName>'s now had more real power than ever
                            before, and he considers this unfortunate.</p>
                        <p>2. Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> had an overall
                            impression of having faced the same problems and the same kind of
                            situation in 1954 and 1955. He feels we are in a sense back again in the
                            beginning.</p>
                        <p>3. The Senator feels that in the years from 1955 through perhaps 1959
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Diem</persName> failed to get rice roots
                            support among the peasants, and that the early drive and enthusiasm
                            which characterized his government was somehow lost. He believes the key
                            to winning the present struggle is not just extending the authority of
                            the government but the extension of popular support and acceptance of
                            the government. The government must be closer to the people.</p>
                        <pb n="798" xml:id="pg_798" facs="0818"/>
                        <p>4. The Senator was extremely critical of the past <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> program. He directed his criticism in particular
                            against former <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> Director Arthur
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAZ1">Gardiner</persName>, whom he regards as
                            a “disaster”. The Senator feels that part of the blame for the lost
                            opportunity during the years 1955 to 1959 rests with our misguided
                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> program and our misdirected
                            military training effort. (He feels the military training effort was
                            misdirected in that it was aimed exclusively at meeting the threat of
                            overt invasion from the north rather than the threat of guerrilla
                            warfare.)</p>
                        <p>5. Nevertheless the Senator feels that the thrust of our present AID and
                            military effort is right. He feels the strategic hamlet program may well
                            succeed. He thinks we must continue our present efforts in pretty much
                            their present form.</p>
                        <p>6. At the same time the Senator was dismayed by the prospect of huge and
                            endless aid expenditures for Viet-Nam. He was not impressed by General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> estimate that the
                            war can be won in one year—in fact, he was apparently annoyed by
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> “undue
                            optimism.”</p>
                        <p>7. If the present effort in Viet-Nam fails, Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> believes our only alternative
                            is to attempt to neutralize the whole area.</p>
