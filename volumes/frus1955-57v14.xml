                <p>The publication <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> constitutes the official record of the foreign policy of the United States. The volumes in the series include, subject to necessary security considerations, all documents needed to give a comprehensive record of the major foreign policy decisions of the United States together with appropriate materials concerning the facts which contributed to the formulation of policies. Documents in the files of the Department of State are supplemented by papers from other government agencies involved in the formulation of foreign plicy.</p>
                <p>The basic documentary diplomatic record printed in the volumes of the series <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> is edited by the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, Department of State. The editing is guided by the principles of historical objectivity and in accordance with the following official guidance first promulgated by Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925.</p>
                <p>There may be no alteration of the text, no deletions without indicating where in the text the deletion is made, and no omission of facts which were of major importance in reaching a decision. Nothing may be omitted for the purpose of concealing or glossing over what might be regarded by some as a defect of policy. However, certain omissions of documents are permissible for the following reasons:</p>
                <list type="simple">
                    <item>a. To avoid publication of matters which would tend to impede current diplomatic negotiations or other business.</item>
                    <item>b. To condense the record and avoid repetition of needless details.</item>
                    <item>c. To preserve the confidence reposed in the Department by individuals and by foreign governments.</item>
                    <item>d. To avoid giving needless offense to other nationalities or individuals.</item>
                    <item>e. To eliminate personal opinions presented in despatches and not acted upon by the Department. To this consideration there is one qualification—in connection with major decisions it is desirable, where possible, to show the alternative presented to the Department before the decision was made.</item>
                </list>

                <p>Documents selected for publication in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes are referred to the Department of State Classification/ Declassification Center for declassification clearance. The Center reviews the documents, makes declassification decisions, and obtains the clearance of geographic and functional bureaus of the Department of State, as well as of other appropriate agencies of the government.</p>
                <p>The Center, in coordination with geographic bureaus of the Department of State, conducts communications with foreign governments regarding documents or information of those governments proposed for inclusion in <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes.</p>
                <p>Carl N. Raether of the Office of the Historian compiled this volume under the supervision of John P. Glennon. Paul Claussen provided planning and direction and Nina J. Noring conducted the initial editorial review. Harriet D. Schwar assisted in final preparation for publication. Lynn Chase and Bret D. Bellamy prepared the lists of sources, names, and abbreviations.</p>
                <p>Althea W. Robinson performed technical editing under the supervision of Rita M. Baker. The Twin Oaks Indexing Collective prepared the index.</p>

                    <item>In this and in other editorial material throughout the volume (document headings, footnotes, and editorial notes), every effort has been made to provide recognizable and consistent transliterations of names of individuals from countries using non–Roman alphabets. The transliterations adopted for proper names were those commonly used by the Department of State at the time, or in documents or official publications of the countries concerned. (In the case of Arabic names, differences arise in the transliteration of vowels. The editors have generally rendered the definite article as al- rather than el–, and have omitted diacritical marks.)</item>

                        <p>On January 4 and 13, 1955, the United Nations Security Council continued its consideration of the case of the <hi rend="italic">Bat Galim,</hi> an Israeli flag ship which had been seized by Egyptian authorities at the southern end of the Suez Canal on September 28, 1954. The Council had taken up the matter in October 1954 at Israel’s request. For related documentation, see <ref target="frus1952-54v09p1">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1952–1954, volume IX, Part 1</ref>, pages 1660–1741 <hi rend="italic">passim.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>On January 4, the Representative of Egypt informed the Security Council that his government had released the crew of the <hi rend="italic">Bat Galim</hi> on January 1; that his government intended to release the ship and suggested that the vessel’s cargo might be placed aboard a neutral vessel for shipment to Haifa; and that a subcommittee of the Egypt-Israel Mixed Armistice Commission should discuss arrangements for the ship’s release.</p>
                        <p>The Representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Brazil, with the support of the Representatives of Belgium, Peru, and New Zealand, commended the dismissal of charges against the <hi rend="italic">Bat Galim’s</hi> crew but disagreed with Egypt’s interpretation of the provisions of the Constantinople Convention of 1888 to justify its refusal to allow free and unobstructed passage of Israel’s ships through the Suez Canal. They maintained that Egypt’s action was also contrary to the Security Council’s resolution of September 1, 1951, which had called upon Egypt to terminate its restrictions on the passage of international shipping through the Suez Canal. (U.N. doc. <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>/2322) (The <pb xml:id="pg_2" n="2" facs="0030"/>Constantinople Convention of October 29, 1988, is printed in <hi rend="italic">British and Foreign State Papers, 1887–1888,</hi> volume 79, pages 18–22, and in <hi rend="italic">The Suez Canal Problem, July 26–September 22, 1956.</hi> (Department of State publication 6392; Washington, 1956), pages 16–20).)</p>
                        <p>Discussion of the matter concluded on January 13, 1955, when the Security Council’s President indicated that it was the consensus of the Council’s members to regard the Council’s resolution of September 1, 1951, as having continuing validity and effect.

                        <p>We agree attempt at settlement Arab-Israeli problem needs again be undertaken and concur in specific objectives cited in reference instruction. We strongly urge, however, that concept of regional defense on one hand and of Arab-Israeli settlement on the other be kept apart with priority of emphasis assigned to former. While we recognize area of overlap exists, fact remains they are basically distinct problems, and deserve to be pursued separately even if concurrently. Any effort unnecessarily entangle them likely impede progress in forging regional defense.</p>
                        <p>We recommend, too, that Iraq no less so than Egypt be among states with which initial discussions on subject are to be begun. As leading contender with Egypt for hegemony in Arab community, any approach to one alone is likely be seized upon by other to push its <pb xml:id="pg_3" n="3" facs="0031"/>own case for leadership in Arab community. Conversely, realization of this possibility likely cause either state be reluctant participate in settlement talks unilaterally. If these two states are approached jointly, possibility exists of fusing any “Arab side” which does not really exist at present time but which appears to us be necessary prelude to possible utilization Trieste technique.</p>
                        <p>Various inducements cited in instructions all have value, but none by itself likely be compelling. We believe that cardinal point in any projected settlement will have to be willingness on part of US Government, no less so than <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, to give public undertaking to underwrite terms of settlement, employing unusual measures if necessary. US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> cooperation in projected efforts seems desirable, but participation by any other state (including Turkey) had best be avoided in initial phases.</p>

                        <p>The following comments are submitted by the Embassy in pursuance of the Department’s request transmitted in <gloss target="#t_CA1">CA</gloss>–3378 of November 22, 1954.<note n="2" xml:id="d4fn2">See <ref target="#d2fn3">footnote 3, Document 2</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. General Observations</p>
                        <p>It has been the Embassy’s observation, based on comments made by Israel leaders to Embassy officers over a period of some months, that the Israel Government itself believes that a rapprochement between Israel and Egypt is a prerequisite to a general Arab-Israel settlement. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> recently commented to an Embassy officer that “it may be taken as axiomatic that Egypt is the key to the problem”. Defense Minister Lavon in a conversation with an Embassy officer at the beginning of November said that if Israel could reach an understanding with Egypt “things would rapidly fall into their proper position elsewhere”. He added that Israel had no outstanding problems with Lebanon which was merely waiting for one of the stronger Arab states to set a precedent; Jordan was a mess but could be straightened out by the British if the Egyptian problem were solved; and Syria was so weak and divided internally that it really didn’t constitute such a problem (to Israel) anyway.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, there is extreme skepticism among Israel Government leaders of the ability of the Nasir regime to survive and, therefore, of its ability or willingness to face up to domestic and Arab League pressures to the extent necessary to negotiate a settlement with Israel on terms acceptable to the latter.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, the period of discussion envisaged by the Department, i.e. February–April 1955, is the time period when the Israelis will be entering vigorously into a campaign period leading up to the general elections scheduled for July of this year. It is quite possible that before the end of that period the coalition Government here will have been dissolved and a Government of a quasi-caretaker character established. It does not follow from this contingency that negotiations during that period would prove impossible. It is unlikely, <pb xml:id="pg_6" n="6" facs="0034"/>however, that such a caretaker Government would be prepared to present to the Knesset an agreement unless its provisions could be successfully defended as having on balance specific advantages to Israel.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, it is difficult to believe that from the standpoint of either country much progress could be made in the general atmosphere prevailing today. This would point to the need of a modus vivendi which would permit the establishment and maintenance of a period of relative calm while the United States and United Kingdom were discussing permanent settlement matters with the two parties individually. This observation would point to the conclusion that pending current issues between the two countries which are now occupying such prominence in the press of Egypt and Israel, such as the Bat Galim case, spy trials,<note n="3" xml:id="d4fn3">On December 11, 1954, Egypt’s Supreme Military Tribunal began the trial of 13 persons charged with spying for Israel and attempting to incite insurrection in Egypt. The trial ended on January 5, 1955, but no verdict was announced at that time. Documentation relating to this case is in Department of State Central Files 774.00 and 784A.5274.</note> and recurrent destruction of the Israel pipeline near the Gaza strip, would have to be taken out of the limelight. In order to establish a period of calm it would appear necessary at the same time as an approach is made to Nasir to make an approach to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>, explaining to him on a confidential basis the purpose of the exercise, the ultimate objectives we have in mind, and the techniques we plan to use in attaining such goals. This discussion should be accompanied by a request for a commitment from him that Israel would pursue a course of action during the period of discussions designed to assist rather than to retard the course of negotiations. The limits of this course of action might include commitments (a) to permit the Suez Canal and Gulf of Akaba issues to remain dormant; (b) positive support to <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> in border matters; (c) restraint on military and police activities along the Gaza strip; and (d) the exercise of unusual restraint in the public statements of Israel leaders regarding Egypt. A comparable list of commitments on the Egyptian side would also appear to be necessary if real progress is to be made. In this connection, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> will be under considerable pressure from the more militant members of his Cabinet to show some measure of progress in lessening restrictions on the movement of Israel goods through Suez as a condition precedent to active negotiations. The <hi rend="italic">Bat Galim</hi> case in its present status is a handicap to the obtention from Israel of a constructive approach to the problem of Israel-Egyptian relations.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the Embassy believes that the participation of the British Embassy here in any discussions with the Israel Government will serve a useful purpose. The position of the United Kingdom with <pb xml:id="pg_7" n="7" facs="0035"/>the local public and with the Israel Government has been greatly strengthened by the remarks of Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> in the House of Commons on November 2, 1954, particularly by his policy statement that the United Kingdom would continue to keep a balance in arms deliveries “as between Israel and the Arab States collectively”. With respect to the question of French participation, the Department is aware of the special problem existing here. The solution suggested of keeping France generally informed but without her active participation would lead to unpredictable results as regards the use the French Mission here might make of the information at its disposal.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Whether we should use Egypt as the main instrument in the Alpha operation is still unresolved and must await the discussions with <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName>. If it is decided to do so, it may be necessary to provide <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> with arms assistance under arrangements which he can accept. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> strongly desires arms aid; arms are necessary to bolster the position of the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>, particularly with the key Army group; there is little else which we can offer now which would be sufficiently attractive. Although <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> might proceed with the first meetings with an Israel representative, he is unlikely to adopt a position permitting progress without some material advantage to Egypt. A détente with Israel offers few advantages to Egypt and many dangers to her present leadership. If Alpha is to have reasonable prospects of success, we must provide positive balancing factors. Some form of arms aid may be indispensable to an answer to this question. Arms assistance would probably also affect the degree of cooperation which Egypt will extend on the Afro-Asian Conference.</p>
                        <p>We suggest the following procedures:</p>
                        <p>(1) In return for <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s taking effective initiative in working toward settlement with Israel, offer to extend to Egypt credit (up to $20 million) under Section 106(b) of the <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss>
                            <note n="4" xml:id="d5fn4">Section 106 of the Mutual Security Act of 1954, which became Public Law 665 on August 26, dealt with the sale of military equipment, materials, and services. For text of the act, see 68 Stat. (pt. 1) 832.</note> for a term of 3 years to purchase military equipment; (2) If negotiations on the Israel question proceed favorably, offer <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> a standard <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> agreement and funds at least sufficient to cover the credit previously extended.</p>
                        <p>One objection to the course suggested is the reaction of Israel and her supporters in this country to what could be labeled a stratagem to avoid a standard <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> agreement. The objection could be met by the answer that we have in effect, through our economic and other aid programs to Israel, extended credit to her to enable her to purchase military equipment; and that the action is being taken specifically as part of a program that contemplates an end to a state of war between Israel and Egypt. (The Israel Government <pb xml:id="pg_9" n="9" facs="0037"/>has always taken the position that peace between the Arab countries and Israel should precede arms to the Arabs.)</p>
                        <p>The Department of Defense has asked our consent to the release of the $20 million in military assistance funds tentatively allocated to Egypt to meet needs in Pakistan and Iran. We propose to agree to the release but also to warn Defense that political developments in the area may make it necessary to obtain funds for grant military assistance to Egypt before <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956 appropriations become available.</p>

                        <p rend="center">SUGGESTED MAIN POINTS OF APPROACH TOWARD ISRAEL-ARAB SETTLEMENT</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Prospects:</hi> While the basic obstacles to Israel-Arab peace still exist, there are a number of reasons for believing that special efforts to induce the parties to take steps toward a settlement of their major differences might bear fruit. These include: an improvement during the past two years in the attitude of important segments of the Arab world toward the West and particularly toward the United States; the promises of the Egyptian government to take steps toward a settlement with Israel following the completion of the Suez base negotiations; the intense concern of Israel over its security and its desire for a treaty arrangement with some major Western power; the Turko-Pakistan<note n="2" xml:id="d6fn2">On April 2, 1954, Turkey and Pakistan signed an Agreement for Friendly Cooperation, which among other points provided for consultation and cooperation on certain defense matters.</note> and Turko-Iraq agreements;<note n="3" xml:id="d6fn3">On January 12, following discussions between Turkish and Iraqi officials in Baghdad, a joint communiqué was issued stating that Iraq would conclude a military alliance with Turkey which other Middle East states would be invited to join. Text of the communiqué is printed in Noble Frankland (ed.), <hi rend="italic">Documents on International Affairs, 1955</hi> (London, Oxford University Press, 1958), pp. 286–287.</note> and the comparative lull of the past few months.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_10" n="10" facs="0038"/>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Immediate Context:</hi> Regardless of the amount and variety of material inducements provided, they alone may prove insufficient to break the present stalemate without the addition of a psychological trigger. Psychological shocks have been applied to area problems in the past with success, for example, the Tripartite Declaration of May 25, 1950,<note n="4" xml:id="d6fn4">For text of the Tripartite Declaration of May 25, 1950, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin,</hi> June 5, 1950, p. 886.</note> and the military assistance agreement with Iraq of April 21, 1954.<note n="5" xml:id="d6fn5">For documentation regarding the negotiation of a military assistance agreement with Iraq on April 21, 1954, see <ref target="frus1952-54v09p2">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1952–1954, vol. IX, Part 2</ref>, p. 2384. For texts of the notes exchanged between representatives of the United States and Iraq, see TIAS 3108; 5 UST (pt. 3) 2496.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The announced intention of Iraq and Turkey to conclude a collective defense agreement against aggression from <hi rend="italic">inside</hi> and outside the area could provide the necessary impetus. However, this development involves dangers and should be handled with delicacy. A worried Israel could react by aggressive moves on her borders. She will probably press with renewed insistance for some sort of security commitment or statement from the U.S. Egypt may resent the announcement which she will regard as a threat to her area leadership and as endangering the Arab League. At the same time the development may stimulate Egypt towards an agreement with Turkey during <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName>’ visit in March. In brief, the Turko-Iraq agreement may serve as a catalyst for further developments in the direction of the Alpha objective.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Basic Approach:</hi> U.S. and U.K. should formulate the elements of a fair settlement. An effort should then be made through various channels, including direct talks where possible, to get the parties to work toward such a settlement or an agreed variation of it. This is suggested in lieu of relying upon direct talks exclusively, and in lieu of a strict following of the Trieste approach. Direct talks may be impossible in some instances and a solution in the present case will require substantial contributions of an economic, political and security nature by outside countries. It is contemplated that different types of approaches would be made with different countries.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Principal Elements of Settlement:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>a. <hi rend="italic">Permanent recognized boundaries between Israel and neighboring countries after frontier rectifications.</hi> The principal boundary provisions would be:</p>
                        <p>(1) Division of the demilitarized zones between Israel and Syria.</p>
                        <p>(2) Minor readjustments of the armistice lines between Israel and Jordan to give villages some of the lands formerly belonging to them so that they may be economically self-supporting. In return for this Israel would receive the Latrun <pb xml:id="pg_11" n="11" facs="0039"/>salient and a portion of the demilitarized zone in this area, thus placing the old Jerusalem road wholly in Israel.</p>
                        <p>b. <hi rend="italic">Security on the border and cooperation in control of infiltration.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>c. <hi rend="italic">Termination of Suez Canal restrictions and of the Arab secondary boycott,</hi> recognizing that the primary boycott would be one of the last points of friction to disappear.</p>
                        <p>d. <hi rend="italic">Agreements on repatriation and resettlement of refugees.</hi> This would be accomplished through: (a) agreement with respect to the Gaza strip refugees … ; (b) resettlement of refugees in the lower Jordan valley under the Jordan River Development Plan; (c) possible resettlement under other similar development plans; (d) turning <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> funds over to the governments of Arab states having refugees and placing the responsibility for the refugees upon them. (This would have to be done gradually and with safeguards.)</p>
                        <p>e. <hi rend="italic">Agreement on compensation of Arab refugees.</hi> Israel has declared her willingness to pay compensation but is financially unable to do so without outside assistance. A neutral international body—possibly a “Palestine Refugee Compensation Commission”—could be set up to administer the compensation plan. Israel could issue debentures to the total present evaluation of Palestine refugee real property in Israel (estimated by the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> at $300 million), the proceeds of which would be utilized to pay the compensation. Working capital in the form of non-interest loans could be provided to Israel by the U.S., U.K., France and other interested governments.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Inducements and Psychological Factors in Security Cooperation.</hi> The inducements and psychological factors which can be utilized in securing the cooperation of Israel and the various Arab states are summarized in attachments A through E.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Order of approach to Arab countries:</hi> Our first approach should be to Egypt, with the realization, however, that if Egypt is to take effective action it must be accompanied or closely followed by action on the part of Jordan. It would be hoped that Lebanon could follow as the third cooperating Arab country. Only after some progress had been made with these three countries would it be worthwhile to make any approach to Syria, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. The nature of such an approach would depend upon the circumstances existing at that time. The approach to Egypt should be in such terms that Egypt does not obtain a veto power over an alternative approach if one becomes necessary.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_12" n="12" facs="0040"/>
                        <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Intra-Area Security:</hi> Steps to create a sense of security on the part of Israel could be:</p>
                        <p>a. Early statement by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> similar to Sir <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony Eden</persName>’s concerning current validity of the Tripartite Declaration.<note n="6" xml:id="d6fn6">For text of <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s remarks, see <hi rend="italic">Parliamentary Debates,</hi> House of Commons, 5th series, vol. 532, cols. 324–335. Further information is in Department of State, Central File 684A.86</note> The Secretary’s statement should follow the Tripartite Declaration more closely than <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s did and should not refer to a “balance of arms”.</p>
                        <p>b. If the British are prepared to do so, a treaty of mutual assistance between Britain and Israel. Israel is at present suffering from a severe feeling of isolation because of the various treaties and agreements between Arab nations and one or more of the great powers while Israel has no such ties (her policy until recently was to avoid such ties). It is unlikely that Israel can be counted upon to engage wholeheartedly in an effort toward area peace in the absence of a treaty with some outside power. The I.G. does not regard a unilateral undertaking by one or more outside powers, to which Israel is not a signatory, as adequate although they would undoubtedly welcome such a commitment if it were supplementary to a treaty arrangement. There appear to be greater objections to a treaty between Israel and the United States, France or Turkey than to one with Britain.<note n="7" xml:id="d6fn7">At a meeting on January 17, <persName>Dulles</persName> considered the proposals advanced in this memorandum and ordered that the Department officers involved in the forthcoming discussions with <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> “take care not to appear to propose that the United Kingdom enter into a treaty as suggested under 7b with Israel.” The Secretary had no objection, however, if <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> and his colleagues asked if “the British Government might itself favor entering into such an arrangement.” (Undated and unsigned typewritten memorandum; Department of State, <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> Files: Lot 59 D 518, Washington Talks, Jan.–Feb. 1955: Memos, etc. preceding actual meetings (Dated 11/15/54 thru 1/27/55))</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>c. If (b) proves impracticable, or if Britain makes a treaty with Israel but desires a supporting arrangement, an agreement in treaty form by the U.S., Britain, France and Turkey that if the integrity of the territory or the sovereignty or political independence of Israel on the one hand or of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Iraq on the other is threatened by any act of the other it would be considered that it constituted a danger to the security of the participating states. In such an eventuality the signatory states would take effective action both in and outside the United Nations in accordance with their respective constitutional processes to meet the common danger.</p>
                        <p>It will be noted that (a) above is a “holding operation”. If (b) proves possible but Britain desires some kind of additional supporting agreement from the United States, but it does not appear possible for the U.S. to give the kind of commitment indicated in (c) above, it might be possible to devise some form of supplemental treaty which would take care of Britain’s requirements.</p>
                        <p>As a further alternative to (b), the United States, the United Kingdom, and possibly France and Turkey might enter into an <pb xml:id="pg_13" n="13" facs="0041"/>arrangement with Israel for her defense against extra-area aggression along the lines of the Manila Pact. It is assumed in connection with this suggestion that the Western states would have already entered into this kind of association through a regional defense arrangement including at least one Arab state (Iraq). We might associate ourselves with the Turko-Iraq treaty with a proviso that we would be concerned under it only with external aggression. This type of arrangement would probably be somewhat less attractive to the Israel Government than (b) but with (c) it might meet their psychological needs.<note n="8" xml:id="d6fn8">At the January 17 meeting, <persName>Dulles</persName> “inquired whether it might be helpful, if in this connection with paragraph 7c, U.S. in conjunction with the U.K., France, Turkey, Israel and the Arab states enter into a treaty commitment embodying the principles of the Tripartite Declaration of May, 1950… . This treaty would be a formal one calling for ratification by the Senate.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Relation between Alpha and Area Security:</hi> We should progress simultaneously toward the two major U.S. objectives in the area— area defense and Arab-Israel settlement—adjusting tactics so that progress toward one objective will assist, or at least not unduly impede, progress toward the other. It is assumed that the Northern Tier is our immediate approach to area defense but that we hope to expand the defense plans eventually to include the effective use of the armed forces and facilities of Israel, Egypt and the other Arab states.</p>
                        <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Arab League:</hi> … our approach is not based upon utilizing the Arab League …. At the same time we should bear in mind the desirability of economic cooperation among the Arab states, and the eventual possibility of federation between two or more Arab states.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">[Attachment] “A”</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p rend="center">ISRAEL</p>
                        <p>Inducements and Psychological Factors in Securing Cooperation</p>
                        <p>1. Israel urgently desires assurances that would strengthen her security and position within the area militarily and politically. She would prefer these assurances in a formal treaty with a strong Western power, either the United States or the United Kingdom, although an alternative arrangement as set forth in paragraph 7 of the covering paper might be satisfactory. If the possibility of one of these arrangements should be decided upon, it should be proffered to Israel as a prize to be won through complete cooperation with the United States and the United Kingdom in the negotiations for a general settlement.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_14" n="14" facs="0042"/>
                        <p>2. The plan for the unified development of the Jordan Valley, with all that it offers to Israel economically and in commencing a solution of the Arab refugee problem, should, at an appropriate time be linked into a general settlement. More specifically, U.S. willingness to provide funds for Israel’s water development could be made contingent upon I.G. cooperation.</p>
                        <p>3. Israel would prize highly assurances from the United States that the economic future of the country is a matter of more than routine interest. We might express to Israel our continued willingness to cooperate with her in striving for economic viability without, however, committing ourselves to any specific level of continuing aid.</p>
                        <p>4. The point can be made to the Israel Government that there is little prospect of effective Israel-Western collaboration in the field of area defense until a general settlement has been achieved.</p>
                        <p>5. United States Jewry could, at an appropriate time, play an important role in influencing the I.G. to cooperate. Jewish donors to Israel will be interested in a program which holds promise of reducing the high annual level of their contributions to Israel as a result of peaceful conditions. Moreover, they would probably be responsive to the argument that Israel-Arab tensions, in the absence of a plan to which both sides must make concessions, will be an increasingly disturbing and troublesome obstacle to Free World security in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>6. We can point out to the I.G. that the substance of our proposals is not at all unfavorable to Israel, nor, in many respects, much at variance with suggestions the Israelis themselves have made in the past. This is particularly true of our suggestions with respect to such problems as refugees, the Jordan River, the future status of Jerusalem, and Israel’s frontiers, the Suez blockade and the secondary boycott.</p>
                        <p>7. While in its early stages Operation Alpha must be secret, there will come a time when it must be made public that the United States and the United Kingdom are exerting direct efforts to improve intra-area relationships. At that time a high level United States–United Kingdom statement of the immeasurable advantages of peace to all concerned might be voiced in a way to serve as a lever for moving the Israel public, and perhaps the Arabs, forward.</p>

                        <p rend="center">EGYPT</p>
                        <p>Inducements and Psychological Factors in Securing Cooperation</p>
                        <p>1. The settlement itself provides little attraction to Egypt. We are already committed to continue certain programs in Egypt regardless of her attitude towards Alpha. Specific returns which we now receive include: general support of Western position on world questions; assistance on the <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> Mission; agreement to the <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss>-Sinai project.<note n="9" xml:id="d6fn9">Reference is to an agreement between representatives of <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> and the Government of Egypt to search for practical development projects in the Sinai Peninsula as well as in the Gaza Strip to enable Palestinian refugees to become economically self-supporting.</note> Because of the relatively limited supply of “carrots” available it will be necessary to space them out avoiding too heavy an expenditure during early stages of negotiations.</p>
                        <p>2. Egypt is primarily interested in military aid without any commitments, at least in the early stages. At the time of the initial negotiations we might agree to extend credit for the purchase of arms under Section 106(b)<note n="10" xml:id="d6fn10">Section 106 of the Mutual Security Act of 1954, which became Public Law 665 on August 26, dealt with the sale of military equipment, materials, and services. For text of the act, see 68 Stat, (pt.1) 832.</note> (credit for 3 years to be paid back in dollars), possibly in the amount of $20 million. Depending on <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> performance during the negotiations, we could later offer a standard <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> agreement which would cover the amount of credit extended plus an additional sum. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s domestic position might permit signature immediately following the first substantial arrivals of U.S. equipment. Alternatively, if the Egyptian domestic situation made it imperative, we could provide grant aid under Section 401,<note n="11" xml:id="d6fn11">Section 401 of the Mutual Security Act of 1954 authorized the President to extend special grant assistance to individuals or nations when he determined that such assistance would contribute to the defense of the North Atlantic area or to the security of the United States.</note> consequent to a special determination by the President. (In this connection, it may be noted that Israel’s objections to arms aid to the Arab states have been based largely on the state of war existing between Israel and the Arab countries. If arms aid to an Arab country were offered in connection with a program for negotiations for peace and was to be in whole or in part conditional upon the success of the negotiations, a large part of the Israel case against the arms aid would fall.)</p>
                        <p>3. We could in any event consider a substantial increase in the number of positions allotted to Egyptian students in U.S. military <pb xml:id="pg_16" n="16" facs="0044"/>schools and the assignment of high priority to Egyptian purchases of U.S. military equipment. A start could be made on the present order for 54,000 helmets which Defense informally estimates might be delivered within one month.</p>
                        <p>4. Special economic aid inducements in addition to current programs might include:</p>
                        <p>a. Committing the Executive, subject to Congressional appropriations, to allot a specific amount as grant assistance to the High Aswan Dam project as soon as engineering studies are sufficiently advanced to permit useful expenditure of the funds. The amount might be $20 million.</p>
                        <p>b. Depending on Egyptian performance during negotiations, committing the Executive to provide additional grant sums to assist in subsequent phases of the High Aswan Dam project. The amounts provided by the U.S. might be such as to cover the gap between Egypt’s borrowing capacity as determined by the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and the yearly cost of the project, possibly $20 million per year for five years.</p>
                        <p>c. Concentration of the Atomic Energy project for the Middle East in Egypt. This would include:</p>
                        <p>(1) Expanded assistance in establishment of the radioisotope laboratory now underway.</p>
                        <p>(2) Establishment of, and necessary training for, an atomic reactor.</p>
                        <p>d. Using U.S. food surpluses to assist Egypt. Wheat is the main requirement.</p>
                        <p>e. Assisting Egypt in marketing her cotton crop. This would include consideration of the U.S. cotton quota and special attention to the effect on Egyptian markets of disposals of U.S. cotton surpluses.</p>
                        <p>5. We should participate on a major scale in the international fair planned for January 1956 in Egypt.</p>
                        <p>6. We could consider steps which might be taken to support Egyptian area aspirations, such as using Egypt as a center for telecommunications, air, or other regional activity, bearing in mind that involved in this matter is Egyptian rivalry with Iraq and the desire of both for area leadership. A security arrangement by which Egypt would be accorded recognition similar to that now given Turkey and Pakistan could have a great effect in this respect.</p>

                        <p rend="center">JORDAN</p>
                        <p>Inducements and Psychological Factors in Securing Cooperation</p>
                        <p>1. The status quo in the Near East is not in Jordan’s interest. Her economy can never be properly developed in the present situation. All Jordan’s neighbor states contain elements which entertain notions as to Jordan’s future which do not coincide with Jordan’s interests. In the absence of a general settlement of the Palestine issue Jordan can only remain as a semi-isolated entity with an uncertain future dependent on external support. Whether Jordan decides that her future lies in continuing as an independent and fully sovereign entity or as a member of a voluntary federation with another Arab state or states, it is to her interest to strengthen herself. Should she wish to enter a federation it should be as an equal partner in fact as well as in name.</p>
                        <p>2. It could be pointed out to Jordan that she is bearing a heavier burden as a result of the Palestine hostilities than any other Arab state. In the day-to-day life of the area almost the full brunt of sporadic hostilities falls upon Jordan. It is Jordan’s trade and communications with the outside world which has been the most thoroughly damaged. Jordan therefore has the most to gain from a resolution of the Palestine difficulties. It is time for Jordan to look to her own interests and to select a course of action which will benefit her the most. The United States and the United Kingdom could then cooperate with Jordan in persuading other Arab states of the necessity of Jordan’s participating in a just and equitable settlement of the controversy. Past experience has shown that Jordan’s leaving the initiative to the Arab League is a fruitless and dangerous course.</p>
                        <p>3. In the type of settlement which we have in mind Jordan will receive a great deal of what she has demanded. There will be provisions for territorial adjustments, repatriation of some refugees, rehabilitation of the rest, and arrangements for compensation. The United States would likewise be prepared to support Jordan in obtaining facilities through Israel for communications with other Arab states and the outside world… . Jordan is already aware of our active support of the proposition that the <gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> must have her full share of the waters of the entire Jordan–Yarmuk system.</p>
                        <p>4. The United Kingdom and the United States would express their continued willingness to cooperate with her in striving for economic viability without, however, committing themselves to any specific level of continuing aid.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_18" n="18" facs="0046"/>
                        <p>5. We fully appreciate that any settlement at all, no matter how just and equitable, would arouse considerable opposition among certain extreme elements in Jordan’s population and create a serious internal security situation. To this end we would be prepared to consult with the Jordanians on ways in which we can be of assistance in dealing with this problem during the transition period. We would also be prepared to speak to Israel in the strongest terms of the necessity for a tranquil border situation.</p>
                        <p>

                        <p rend="center">LEBANON</p>
                        <p>Inducements and Psychological Factors in Securing Cooperation</p>
                        <p>1. It will not be possible to induce Lebanon to consider moving toward a firm settlement with Israel unless either Egypt or Jordan has already done so. Indeed it is probable that Lebanon will not make a settlement unless both Egypt and Jordan have already done so. If Egypt and Jordan move toward a settlement, and the Government of Lebanon is aware that this is so, the following inducements would help to persuade the Lebanese to follow the Egyptian and Jordanian lead in undertaking a settlement. Each should be offered to the Lebanese conditional upon their actually following the Egyptians and Jordanians in undertaking a settlement. Irrespective of such positive action as Lebanon might take it is to be foreseen, on the basis of past experience, that the Lebanese would probably be disposed to exert constructive efforts behind the scenes, particularly in respect of Jordan.</p>
                        <p>2. The Lebanese are most anxious to receive military aid from the U.S., which they desire primarily for internal security and prestige reasons, and as a sign of the recognition by the U.S. of the importance of Lebanon. The cost to the U.S. would be perhaps $5 to $10 million.</p>
                        <p>3. The Lebanese would like to receive economic aid on a much larger scale than at present (in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 they received $6 million economic assistance; the figure for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 will be much smaller). The Lebanese would like us to finance a significant portion of the Litani River development project, and they would like large scale help for example, with their road program. An offer of some $10 million for these or similar purposes, over and above our “normal” technical assistance and economic aid, would be genuine inducement.</p>
                        <p>4. Like the other Arab states, Lebanon fears that Israel unless held in check may some day attempt to expand at Lebanon’s <pb xml:id="pg_19" n="19" facs="0047"/>expense. The Lebanese fear that Israel some day may attempt by force of arms to establish control over the waters of the Litani River for the benefit of Israel. A Western security guarantee of Lebanon against the possibility of an attack by Israel would be most welcome. A quadripartite guarantee of Lebanon’s borders against Israel aggression (and vice versa), as suggested in 7 (c) of the covering paper, conditional upon a Lebanon–Israel peace settlement, would thus constitute an effective inducement.</p>
                        <p>5. A basis fear of the dominant <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Christian</persName> element in Lebanon is that some day the country may lose its separate identity through absorption into the neighboring Moslem states, particularly Syria. At the time of the Tripartite Declaration, it was stated orally to one or more of the Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia, that the Declaration would be interpreted by the United States as applying to an act of aggression by one of the Arab states against another, as well as to an act of aggression by Israel. A reaffirmation of this to Lebanon would be well received there. In taking such a position, however, we should make it clear that we are not against voluntary federation by two or more of the Arab states.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">[Attachment] “E”</hi>

                        <p rend="center">SYRIA</p>
                        <p>Inducements and Psychological Factors in Securing Cooperation</p>
                        <p>1. Syria, like Iraq and Saudi Arabia, will be far more hesitant than Egypt, Jordan or Lebanon to move toward a settlement with Israel. The mood in Syria at the present time is so negative, so violently anti-Israel, so anti-Western that it is inadvisable to approach Syria regarding a Palestine settlement at least until some time after the approaches to Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon have been made, and have produced results. Under these circumstances, however, Syria might consider moving toward a settlement. Syria has a common boundary with Israel, and certain territorial aims in the demilitarized zones and desires changes in the present armistice line which might be realized in part by a settlement with Israel. Syria has more reason to make a settlement than either Iraq or Saudi Arabia.</p>
                        <p>2. Under the changed circumstances, the most effective inducements for Syria would be the same as in the case of Lebanon: military aid sufficient to strengthen significantly the Syrian Army; economic aid (for such projects as roads, port development and irrigation work on the Euphrates); and a quadripartite guarantee of Syria against Israel aggression.</p>

                            </note> The “Arab Plan” had called for over 900 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">MCM</gloss> for Jordan<note n="4" xml:id="d8fn4">Reference is to the Arab League’s <hi rend="italic">The Arab Plan for Development of the Water Resources of the Jordan Valley</hi> (Cairo, 1954).</note>. The United States Government was convinced that the conclusions of Messrs. Baker and Harza were sound and based on the best available engineering technique and proposed to support them. The allocation to Syria was 132 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">MCM</gloss> annually, and to Lebanon, 35 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">MCM</gloss> annually. These figures had already received general acceptance from both Israel and the Arab riparian states, and no difficulty was anticipated on that score. This left 454 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">MCM</gloss> annually for Israel. Of Israel’s allocation, 150 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">MCM</gloss> would be diverted out of the basin for irrigation on the coastal plain.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Where to store the water?</hi> The Baker-Harza report had rejected the Maqarin site on the Yarmuk. The report recommended the construction of a dam further down the river at Wadi Khalid. There were two alternative heights to that dam—40 or 60 meters. The lower dam would cost $11 million and store 47 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">MCM</gloss>, the higher would cost $17.5 million and store 118 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">MCM</gloss>. Twenty thousand kilowatts of electricity could be generated by facilities constructed at the higher dam. The remainder of the necessary storage would have to take place in Lake Tiberias, which was the only feasible site, and in which storage facilities could be constructed without undue cost.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">How to guarantee the enforcement of the division of waters.</hi> There would have to be some form of international control of the division of the waters. This had been a difficult point in the negotiations. The Israelis were most sensitive over their sovereignty and did not like the idea of an international agency exercising control over installations in Israel territory. The Arabs were distrustful lest at certain times of the year, Israel could defy an international water master and not be brought to terms until crops on Arab lands had been ruined. It was mentioned that the final plan provided some means of retaliation by the Arabs. Furthermore, the storage on the Yarmuk could be used as a reserve for this contingency.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Extra-basin use by Israel.</hi> The U.S. position was that once the allocations to the riparian states had been agreed upon, any of the sovereign states concerned could use the allocated water anywhere it desired in its territories. This meant that Israel could proceed with the construction of the diversion works at Jisr Banat Ya’aqub.<note n="5" xml:id="d8fn5">On September 2, 1953, Israel began construction of a canal to divert the waters of the Jordan River at Jisr Banat Yaqub in the demilitarized zone dividing Israel and Syria. Work was suspended after 3 weeks due to Syrian objections. The matter was taken to the U.N. Security Council in October 1953. For documentation, see <ref target="frus1952-54v09p1">

IX, Part 1</ref>, pp. 1303 ff.</note> The <pb xml:id="pg_23" n="23" facs="0051"/>Arabs did not like this, and we were not sure of the outcome of negotiations on this point, but we had cautious grounds for optimism. The resolution of this point would mean the removal from the agenda of the Security Council of a very troublesome item.</p>
                        <p>There was a brief discussion of the problem of making the benefits of the development in Jordan available to refugees. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> pointed out that this was outside his own frame of reference and that the plan was that <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> should finance the works in Jordan under arrangements whereby significant benefits to refugees would emerge. He was meeting Mr. Labouisse, <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss>’s Director, in Athens to discuss this particular aspect of the matter.<note n="6" xml:id="d8fn6">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> and his party met with Labouisse and his associates in Athens on January 25. Summary minutes of this meeting are in Department of State, <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss>/IAI Files: Lot 70 D 254, <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> Mission Minutes of Meetings.</note> It appeared that only about 12% of the land to be irrigated in Jordan belonged to the State and that there were between four and five thousand landowners owning the remainder. Some of the private tracts were reasonably large. It was doubtful whether Jordan would be in a position to undertake a full-fledged land reform aimed at establishing family-sized farms all over the Valley. We would probably have to be content with something less than that.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> expressed his appreciation for the very thorough resume of the position which had been given him. He undertook to relay this information to the Foreign Office and to British diplomatic missions in the field. The latter would be alerted to the forthcoming arrival of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> and instructed to give his mission general help. If the U.S. wanted further assistance on specific matters at appropriate times and places, it should ask the British Government for such help.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> presented a summary of the discussions with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> on operation Alpha, making the following points:</p>
                        <p>1. Despite the difficulties involved, it is worth making the effort. It is impossible to assess accurately ahead of time all the factors, particularly the psychological ones which may bear on the final result. We should go ahead and be in a position to take advantage of every favorable development.</p>
                        <p>2. The first approach should be made to Egypt. Among the inducements which may be extended are:</p>
                        <p>a. Help to the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> to stay in power.</p>
                        <p>b. Support for Egypt as a focal point of power in the Middle East to enable her to play her rightful role in the area and in the world.</p>
                        <p>c. Military aid in the context of a peace settlement.</p>
                        <p>d. Assistance towards the High Aswan Dam.</p>
                        <p>(Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> inquired whether Egypt would be approached as the leader of the Arab states, observing that the Arabs now seem to be quarreling among themselves. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> replied that the appeal would be to Egyptian nationalism rather than to Egypt as an Arab leader.)</p>
                        <p>3. A security guarantee is essential. A treaty by the US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, and possibly Turkey and France, is envisaged with Israel and a separate one with Egypt. Other Arab states could adhere to the Egyptian treaty or separate treaties could be concluded with each. The treaty would refer to the various provisions of the settlement but could be invoked only in case of a real attack by the Arabs or Israel on the other. All the provisions of the settlement would not be <pb xml:id="pg_25" n="25" facs="0053"/>guaranteed and the guarantors would not be expected to act in case of minor frontier incidents or even raids on the scale of Qibya.<note n="2" xml:id="d9fn2">For documentation on the Qibya incident of October 17, 1953, see <ref target="frus1952-54v09p1">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1952–1954, vol. IX, Part 1</ref>, pp. 1361 ff.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>(Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> inquired whether a new agency was contemplated to settle disputes between the two parties. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> replied that the <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> would continue to perform this function. He added that staff talks might be held with the two parties regarding the implementation of the security guarantees.)</p>
                        <p>4. Territorial changes symbolic of a retreat by Israel are necessary. However, careful examination of the problem reveals no practical opportunities for large cessions of territory. The following might be considered: Lebanon—no change; Syria—minor adjustments along the lines of previous Syrian-Israel discussions under <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> auspices. If the <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> Mission succeeds, the changes would have to be within the framework of the Unified Plan. Jordan—a series of frontier modifications to unite Arab villages with their lands now in Israel hands. The bulk of the Latrun demilitarized area would go to Jordan, but the old Jerusalem road would be given to Israel. Jerusalem—no change except for a division of the No Man’s Lands …. The Negev—Egypt has demanded that Israel cede a portion of the Negev to unite her with Jordan. Arrangements could be made whereby Egypt would receive a small wedge of territory in the Negev a few miles north of Elath. This wedge would come to a point on the Jordan border and would not cut the Israel road to Elath. Both Israel and Arab traffic would be permitted to cross the junction point, perhaps by means of a bridge and underpass. A track across the Sinai Desert could be developed to provide communication from Egypt to Jordan.</p>
                        <p>(Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> mentioned that it might be important to provide also for oil pipelines to cross.)</p>
                        <p>5. The Arabs would be expected to terminate the secondary boycott of Israel, but would not be pressed to trade directly with Israel. Egypt would be asked to remove restrictions on Suez Canal traffic.</p>
                        <p>6. France and Turkey would not be informed of the plan at an early stage. Whether they should be parties to the treaty guaranteeing security would depend on the views of the Arabs. Israel would certainly like at least Turkey to participate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> concluded that the above points will form the basis for further study and that working parties would be established to consider details.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> explained that the basic difficulty would be to persuade the Arabs that it is worth their while to make peace. It <pb xml:id="pg_26" n="26" facs="0054"/>would be necessary to overcome psychological inhibitions. Territorial adjustments, repatriation of refugees and compensation would all help. The question of territory was particularly difficult. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> felt there might be a divergence here between the US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> views. He thought that Israel should cede all the territory east of Lake Tiberias and of the Jordan River. He concluded that all things considered, there was barely enough in the plan for the Arabs to make it worth-while going ahead.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRA1">Hare</persName> observed that one set of “gimmicks” was needed to appeal to Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. These might include the territorial changes, refugee repatriation and compensation. These items would not appeal to Egypt for whom a different set of “gimmicks” would be required, which might consist of economic and military aid.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> pointed out that the settlement provided more for Israel than for the Arabs and listed among her benefits the security guarantee, … improved trading opportunities and peace. To obtain this he felt that Israel must make some sacrifices.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRA1">Hare</persName> stated that instead of saying that Israel wants peace it might be more accurate to state that she wants arrangements which will permit a consolidation of her position. The Arabs are not ready to accord this.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> explained that it was planned to see first whether <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>
                            <note n="3" xml:id="d9fn3">On January 17, the Department instructed the Embassy in Cairo that henceforth it was to spell the Egyptian Prime Minister’s name “<persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>” instead of “Nasir”. (Telegram 1113 to Cairo; Department of State, Central Files, 774.13/1–1755)</note> is ready to play. Then, the plan would be explained in detail to Israel. If the negotiations break down as a result of her intransigence, the interests of the US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> in the Middle East require that responsibility should rest on Israel. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> observed that when Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> stops in Cairo about February 20 he might in his talks with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> help create an appropriate atmosphere but would not reveal the plans as such. After Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName>
                            <note n="4" xml:id="d9fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> remained Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern, South Asian, and African Affairs until January 25, one day after being appointed Ambassador to Egypt.</note> arrived he would require a few weeks to establish his position before broaching the question of Israel to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> stated that it was planned to resume the talks with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> in London about February 21 and that the approach might be made in mid-March or the first of April.</p>
                        <p>In assessing the possibilities of success, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRA1">Hare</persName> explained that the present impasse was the result of all the forces and imagination which have been applied to the problem in the past. It was necessary to see if some new element was now present. The indications of <pb xml:id="pg_27" n="27" facs="0055"/>receptivity on the part of Egypt, the greater readiness in certain quarters of the Arab world to take a broader view of the matter and the relatively favorable reception given <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Eric Johnston</persName>, might constitute such new factors. In addition, something was needed to crack the problem open. Perhaps, this impact had been supplied by the Turk-Iraq announcement. Also, the US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> were now prepared to go further than in the past by guaranteeing the settlement and by directing their assistance programs specifically towards an agreement. Even considering all these possibly favorable factors he was not overly encouraged over the prospects. He felt that the chances were only moderate. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> stated that it was best not to do anything until after Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>’s return. If he came close to obtaining an agreement it might be better not to disturb the situation by the present project. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> suggested, however, it might be useful to take advantage of the momentum gained.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> agreed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName>’s observation that it would be very dangerous if the Western Powers came up with something at which Israel leaped and which the Arabs regarded as another sell-out. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> also stated that this was the big danger in the undertaking. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> thought it might be wise to go a little further with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> in the first discussions with him than had originally been planned before broaching the plan to Israel. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRA1">Hare</persName> expressed the opinion that it was advisable to work gradually and not put forward the whole package at once on a take it or leave it basis. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> stated that many of the elements are interdependent. For example, Egypt would not want to lift the Suez Canal restrictions unless she received some benefit elsewhere. In addition, once an offer was made by the Western Powers it would be difficult to take it back.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> stated that in view of Israel’s strong desire for a security undertaking it would be difficult to withdraw the offer once it were made. He wondered if some one other than the US or the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> could explore the problem with Israel.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> listed Israel’s desires as: Direct talks with the Arabs; a security pact with a Western Power; participation in regional defense and no arms shipments to the Arabs. He stressed that Israel did not want others to work out a peace plan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRA1">Hare</persName> stated that Egypt was the key to the project in that it was the largest Arab country and therefore could move more independently and could be appealed to with items not directly a part of the Palestine settlement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> recalled that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> had always had the idea of approaching the weakest Arab state first, i.e., Jordan. In reply to a question he added that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> felt there <pb xml:id="pg_28" n="28" facs="0056"/>was a good chance that Jordan might be the second Arab state to reach a settlement.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> expressed appreciation of this opportunity to make a joint progress report to the Secretary regarding the conversations which he and his associates had been holding with officers of the Department regarding the prospects of Arab-Israel peace. All had reached the general conclusion that it was worthwhile to proceed with the “package” idea, to be tried out separately on the two parties to the dispute. <gloss target="#t_ONE1">One</gloss> of these parties, Israel, desired a settlement while the Arab side showed little desire for a settlement. It therefore followed that incentives were needed on the Arab side. These must include some sacrifices by Israel as well as supplementary inducements furnished by the United States and the United Kingdom. Among the Arab states, Egypt appeared to be the most likely prospect for a move toward settlement. We were therefore primarily concerned with the question of the attractions which a settlement might have, or be made to have for Egypt. These attractions appeared to fall into two categories.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_29" n="29" facs="0057"/>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">first category</hi> consisted of the following elements:</p>
                        <p>(1) Territorial adjustments in favor of the Arabs.</p>
                        <p>(2) Some repatriation of refugees.</p>
                        <p>(3) Compensation to refugees not repatriated.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">second category</hi> consisted of a necessary US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> guarantee of whatever settlement might finally be reached.</p>
                        <p>The most important specific attraction to Egyptians seemed to be an offer by the US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to increase Egypt’s influence in the Middle East via military and economic aid. It was thought that the recent move by Iraq toward a treaty with Turkey might assist in spurring Egypt in the desired direction.</p>
                        <p>Special factors in our efforts toward a settlement must relate to the refugee problem: (1) the <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> Mission with its prospects for large refugee resettlement in the Jordan Valley; (2) repatriation of some refugees to Israel; and (3) the development of labor-absorbing programs in those Arab states harboring refugees, in order to draw refugees from the camps and make them self-sustaining. … an increase in Israel’s territory would require that Israel compensate by releasing other territory; for example, a wedge of land to Egypt above Elath to create overland communication between Egypt and Jordan. (At this “pinpoint” contact Israel and Jordan traffic would cross under some form of international supervision); territorial concessions by Israel to Jordan, including adjustments to reunite Jordan villages with their lands to the extent possible without excessively narrowing the “waist” of Israel ….</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked what was planned for Jerusalem. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> replied that it was expected … to push for a decision on the Holy places along the lines of the Swedish resolution;<note n="2" xml:id="d10fn2">For information concerning the Swedish draft resolution dated December 5, 1950, on the Jerusalem question (U.N. doc. <gloss target="#t_A1">A</gloss>/AC.38/L.63) which was submitted to the Ad Hoc Political Committee of the General Assembly, see the editorial note and <ref target="#d10fn3">footnote 3</ref>, <ref target="frus1950v05">

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> indicated that a plan for US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> guarantee of borders was being worked on by the Legal Adviser’s office of the Department.<note n="3" xml:id="d10fn3">Documentation concerning the preparation of a joint plan to guarantee borders is in Department of State, <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> Files: Lot 59 D 518, Alpha Treaty: Successive drafts of Legal Aspects—Forms and Guarantees.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked what the views of the group were regarding procedure and timing. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> replied that it was planned to hold the next meeting in London, perhaps in late February. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Eric Johnston</persName> would return to the United States in late February. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> might be able to make his first approach to Prime <pb xml:id="pg_30" n="30" facs="0058"/>Minister <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> by mid or late March allowing necessary time to establish himself and develop contacts following his arrival in Egypt toward the end of February. He remarked that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> did not wish to make the first subject of business with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> the problem of settlement between the Arab states and Israel. Sir <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony Eden</persName> would be going to Bangkok via Cairo in late February.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary inquired how the group expected to keep Jewish leaders in this country quiet during this period of preparation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> replied that it was thought that the Secretary himself might inform the Israelis that Israel’s security would be taken care of in any measures we might adopt in the area and that in addition he might at a press conference give some reassurances along the lines of <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s statement to the House of Commons or alternatively merely indicate that he was working on the problem. It was also thought during his visit to Cairo Sir Anthony might tell <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> personally that the West desired to make Egypt become a greater focus of strength. All had agreed that the first real approach to Operation Alpha would be made by <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>. The fact that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> was approached first would serve two purposes: It might be flattering and it would in any case indicate the possibilities of progress from thereon. Israel would not be approached first…. However, if Israel were approached in second place and she reacted badly, the onus of failure would be on Israel…. Israel is the petitioning power. The Secretary rejoined that this was not clear to him. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> further explained that certain factors in the plan would be unattractive to Israel… . However, Israel would not wish to appear to be the party who wrecked the project… .</p>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked that this procedure seemed complicated. After Egypt and Israel, what came next? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> replied that Jordan would then be approached since she had “built in” inducements to make a settlement. Lebanon would come in third place among the Arabs. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> remarked that it would be necessary to consult <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> on all subsequent approaches to Arab countries if he reacted favorably to the plan.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked that it was desirable to have alternatives in the case of an early rejection in order to convince Egypt that the US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> meant business and that the present situation would not be allowed to continue. The Arabs must be made to comprehend the continued power of American Jewry and the fact that if Arab attitudes continued to be unreasonable the balance of focus may shift from their side. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> remarked that pressures on Israel would be indispensable yet difficult to apply. The Arabs were in a favorable position. They could sit by and if, after Israel made concessions, they rejected these we might be at an impasse. The <pb xml:id="pg_31" n="31" facs="0059"/>Secretary rejoined that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> should not be allowed to feel that he can say <hi rend="italic">no</hi> and that matters would then stand until he was ready to say <hi rend="italic">yes.</hi> The United States Government rode out the recent Congressional elections at a sacrifice. Whether it could ride out a Presidential election is uncertain. After 1955 the Arab-Israel problem would be in US domestic politics and if the Republicans failed to offer measures acceptable to American Jewry the Democrats would surely promise them. The Administration had succeeded in deflating Israel in order to make a reasonable settlement possible. As a result the Israeli position was now weaker than it ever had been, but by 1956 it was likely to gain new strength. The Arabs should be reminded of this and shown that now was the best time for them to negotiate from a position of strength unless they were prepared to see Israel once again undertake faits accomplis at their expense. The US was now in a position to put pressures on Israel. If Israel rejected a reasonable proposal, it would jeopardize public and private aid to Israel from the United States, for American Jewry was not disposed to throw its money away recklessly on a bad venture. The Secretary had been given to understand that the Banat Yaqub affair had had a bad effect on Israel’s bond sales in the US. To both sides there should be an immense attraction to make a settlement now with the indispensable Anglo-American guarantee to that settlement. That guarantee was necessary since there was genuine fear on both sides. How far the US could go in such a guarantee was a serious question. The Secretary felt that the Senate would probably go pretty far despite the fact that it was not America’s practice to guarantee the territories of other countries, because of American domestic considerations pertaining to Israel. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> asked whether the extent of Congressional willingness to back a guarantee should be verified in advance of the first approaches on Operation Alpha. The Secretary advised against approaching any groups in Congress or Defense at the present time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> inquired whether if Israel should complain of parts of the “package” the US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would stand firmly behind the “package”. In order to clarify this question, the Secretary asked whether it was intended to obtain <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s general concurrence to the plan and then discuss the specific elements of the “package” with Israel. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> replied in the affirmative.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary suggested that Sir <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony Eden</persName> might during his visit to Cairo discuss with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> the general situation in the United States as he had just outlined it to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> pointing out the wisdom of making a move now toward a settlement with Israel. The Secretary felt that the real issue with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> would be whether Egypt could live with any concept of peace with Israel. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> responded that current plans did not include a formal peace <pb xml:id="pg_32" n="32" facs="0060"/>treaty but rather a settlement. The Secretary inquired how it was possible to make a Western guarantee without a peace treaty. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> pointed out that the parties would be agreeing to final boundaries and that that the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would guarantee only those final boundary lines. There would be a settlement of other issues which we would not guarantee, such as refugee repatriation, resettlement, compensation of refugees, elimination of the secondary boycott against Israel and of the Suez blockade. The Secretary felt that the absence of peace would make very difficult the obtaining of a guarantee from the United States. For example, what would be done about extraditing nationals of one side found in the territory of the other. Would they be treated as alien enemies? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> replied that this point had not yet been faced. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> stated that it would be necessary to put an end to the present state of war and particularly to end the Suez blockade. The Secretary inquired whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> was confident that there was no use in trying for a formal peace. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> replied in the affirmative and gave his view that the chances were only 51 to 49 in favor of achieving a settlement short of formal peace. The Secretary concluded that Operation Alpha was worth undertaking but again pointed out that the US Government would have trouble on the guarantee provisions unless it could be said that peace had been achieved between the parties. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> pointed out that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> and Prime Minister Sharrett of Israel desired a guarantee <hi rend="italic">before</hi> peace in order to be able to negotiate from secure strength with the Arabs.</p>

                        <p> “As the Government of Egypt well knows, the President and the Secretary of State have been giving careful study to ways and means of lessening the tensions that have unfortunately existed in the Middle East, and they feel that some constructive progress has been made.

                        <p rend="center">POINTS OF AGREEMENT IN DISCUSSION ON ARAB-ISRAEL SETTLEMENT</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. General</p>
                        <p>1. The present is as favorable a time as is likely to arise in the foreseeable future for an attempt to achieve a settlement of the dispute between the Arab states and Israel.</p>
                        <p>2. An attempt at a general settlement will allow us to present a balanced set of proposals which might permit us to dispose of some problems, such as boundaries which are resistant to solution in isolation.</p>
                        <p>3. An effort to reach a general settlement should therefore be made soon; but this should not interfere with attempts being made to solve the problems of Jordan Valley development.</p>
                        <p>4. The method which offers the best chance of success and involves the least risk is that the United States and United Kingdom Governments should work out the general terms of a reasonable settlement and then by separate discussion with the parties concerned, and if possible through direct talks between them, attempt to get them to agree to the settlement or to an agreed variation of it.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Method and Timing of the Approach to the Parties</p>
                        <p>1. The first approach should be made to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> by Sir <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony Eden</persName> on his way through Cairo. It would be left to <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s discretion to determine how fully he would develop the subject. If <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s reaction warrants, he could give him a general idea of U.S.–U.K. thinking, but not reveal the existence of a plan. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> would endeavor to ascertain what steps <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> is willing to take, what role he is willing to play with respect to the other Arab states and how <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> believes the U.S. and U.K. should approach the other Arab states. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> would emphasize the confidential nature of his discussions.</p>
                        <p>2. The exact nature of the next step would depend upon the results achieved under 1. It will probably be necessary to follow up the <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> conversations by developing further the substance of the proposals. If <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> indicates a desire to proceed immediately, an officer could be sent from the State Department for this purpose. Otherwise the discussions could be carried on by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName>. In view of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s first approach Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> could raise the matter shortly after his arrival. (Should the <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> discussions still be in progress at the time of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s arrival in Cairo, the extent of his discussions with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> would have to take into account the possible effects on the <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> Mission.)</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_36" n="36" facs="0064"/>
                        <p>3. The U.K. would outline our intentions to Jordan. This approach is necessary prior to discussions with Israel because of the special treaty relationship between the U.K. and Jordan.</p>
                        <p>4. Indication of the intentions of the U.K. and the U.S. would be given to France and Turkey simultaneously with the approach to Jordan and before the approach to Israel.</p>
                        <p>5. As soon as possible after stage 4 above, the nature of a general settlement would be discussed in detail with Israel. We would indicate that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> was prepared to consider a settlement and that we have drawn up as a basis for discussion a set of ideas which we consider offers prospect of progress toward a settlement. We would state that if Israel is ready to pursue discussions on this basis, we were prepared to continue our efforts. If it should be necessary, we would make clear to Israel the effects of a refusal on her part to cooperate, mentioning particularly that under such circumstances we would be unable to extend the security guarantee she has requested, and that she would have to bear the onus for failure of our efforts to progress toward peace.</p>
                        <p>6. The approach to Lebanon, Syria and Iraq would be determined in the light of the discussions with Egypt.</p>
                        <p>8. It is essential that we retain the utmost flexibility and endeavor to maintain secrecy. We must always be ready to exploit quickly any unexpected opportunity for progress. Each step should be taken cautiously; and in the early stage of the negotiations we should avoid actions which might commit us more deeply than necessary to formal support for a rigid plan.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. Inducements and Psychological Factors</p>
                        <p>1. The terms of the settlement itself will contain inducements to the parties, but these will probably be insufficient to overcome the Arabs’ resistance to any settlement and Israel’s reluctance to make the concessions required of her. Outside inducements will therefore be necessary: e.g., military and economic aid, and security guarantee.</p>
                        <p>2. Since no Arab state is likely to participate in a settlement unless it knows that Egypt is sympathetic, Egyptian cooperation is of first importance in any attempt at a settlement. We shall therefore need to offer inducements to Egypt. The following are the main possibilities:—</p>
                        <p>a. The flattery implied in the fact that we have chosen to consult <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> first and cannot get on without him.</p>
                        <p>b. The suggestion that if Egypt will take the lead in solving this problem it will eventually strengthen her position in the Middle East <pb xml:id="pg_37" n="37" facs="0065"/>and enable her to play a more important role in cooperation with the West. The solution of the Palestine problem will eliminate a major impediment to such cooperation.</p>
                        <p>c. Military assistance, the extent and conditions of which will in any case depend on the state of the relations between Israel and the Arab states.</p>
                        <p>d. The prospect of support for Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s plans for the future of Egypt.</p>
                        <p>e. Specific offers of economic aid, for example, on the High Aswan Dam project.</p>
                        <p>f. The offer of a security guarantee.</p>
                        <p>3. Inducements to Israel include:—</p>
                        <p>a. A security guarantee.</p>
                        <p>b. Elimination of factors creating tension between Israel and her neighbors.</p>
                        <p>c. Removal of Suez Canal restrictions. Termination of the secondary boycott.</p>
                        <p>d. Continued U.S.–U.K. interest in Israel’s economic future.</p>
                        <p>f. Military assistance.</p>
                        <p>g. Brighter prospects for Israel’s association in area defense arrangements.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">IV. Elements of Settlement</p>
                        <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Territorial Adjustments.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Israel must make concessions. The Arabs will not reconcile themselves to her present boundaries. But we cannot expect large transfers of territory: the concessions will be partly symbolic and partly designed to produce a frontier which could last with a minimum of friction.</p>
                        <p>2. We cannot make final recommendations on the North Jordan Valley and Lake Tiberias area until the results of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>’s mission are clear. …</p>
                        <p>3. The No Man’s Land areas between Israel and Jordan should be divided. The aim should be that most of the territory should go to Jordan but the question of awarding the tip of the Latrun salient to Israel to permit the restoration of the old Tel Aviv-Jerusalem road should be studied further.</p>
                        <p>4. On the Israel-Jordan frontier, Israel would be asked to agree to adjustments based on the principle of reuniting farm lands with Arab agricultural villages. Further study must be given to the possible magnitude of such adjustments and their strategic and economic effect before the United States and United Kingdom can make firm recommendations.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_38" n="38" facs="0066"/>
                        <p>6. In the discussions with Egypt, the Egyptians should be asked to comment on disposition of the Gaza Strip… .</p>
                        <p>7. In the southern Negev Israel would be asked to relinquish a small triangle of territory north of Elath. This triangle would have its base on the Israel-Egyptian frontier and its apex on the Israel-Jordan frontier so as to provide over-land communications between Egypt and Jordan. The triangle would be located at a point where the Israel road to Elath from Beersheba and Sodom runs close to the Jordan frontier. At the junction of the Israel north-south road and the Arab east-west road there might have to be some form of international supervision and control.</p>
                        <p>8. Terms of reference for the study group on this matter are attached.<note n="3" xml:id="d13fn3">Attached to the source text but not printed.

                        </p>
                        <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Refugees</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Israel would offer to readmit those refugees who wish to return up to a certain figure, say 75,000. This figure might run up to 150,000 if the Gaza Strip were ceded to Israel (see IV, A. 6. above). It would be understood that refugees returning to Israel, would come as Israel citizens.</p>
                        <p>a. The Israel Government would donate land and <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> would finance the development of that land to permit the rehabilitation in Israel of those refugees choosing to return there.</p>
                        <p>2. Israel would undertake to pay compensation for Arab refugee real property and establish a fund for the purpose. Some kind of trustee organization would be set up to handle the payment of compensation.</p>
                        <p>3. Israel would borrow money from the Western Powers to help pay the compensation. It is however desirable that some part of the money should come directly from Israel herself: and German reparations and contributions from World Jewry might be used to this end.</p>
                        <p>4. In the payment of compensation individual claims would be scaled down. <persName corresp="#p_PMGWBJ1">Persons</persName> receiving more than a fixed amount would thereby relinquish all claims on <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> for relief and rehabilitation. Some arrangement would be needed to ensure that large sums paid to individuals were invested in the area and used to promote employment for the refugees. In general compensation should be so <pb xml:id="pg_39" n="39" facs="0067"/>applied that it would make as many refugees as possible independent of <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> assistance.</p>
                        <p>5. Of the refugees who remained a charge to <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> after the payment of compensation, it is hoped that 100–150,000 could be settled in the Jordan Valley when the development scheme was completed, and 50–75,000 on the Sinai project. Those refugees in Syria and Lebanon who did not return to Israel would stay in their host countries which would gradually integrate them into their societies, possibly with the help of lump sum payments by <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>6. In Jordan, and possibly Gaza, <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> would have to continue relief until the further economic development of the area or resettlement schemes create opportunities for the remaining refugees. <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> relief would be made less attractive as these opportunities became more promising.</p>

                        <p>1. The U.S. and U.K. would inform the parties that they were prepared to sponsor a U.N. resolution on the lines of the Swedish proposal of 1950 on the supervision of and access to the Holy Places; ….</p>
                        <p>2. Israel would be informed that following agreement upon a settlement and pending the adoption of such a resolution, the U.S. and U.K. Ambassadors would start to call at the Israeli Foreign Office in Jerusalem, ….</p>
                        <p>3. The aim should be to eliminate the No Man’s Land in Jerusalem by agreement between Israel and Jordan. Government House would become the seat of the international authority charged with the supervision of the Holy Places and possibly other U.N. agencies.</p>

                        <p>1. Israel to offer Jordan free port facilities at Haifa and free access to the port.</p>
                        <p>2. Mutual overflight rights for civil aircraft of the parties.</p>
                        <p>3. Israel to permit the restoration or construction of telecommunications between the Arab states across her territory.</p>
                        <p>4. Israel to accord to Egypt or Jordan the right to construct a road across the Southern Negeb and to allow free transit without inspection in peace-time (but see A above).</p>
                        <p>5. Some mixed or U.N. authority to be established to hear complaints on the infringement of communications rights.</p>
                        <p>E. <hi rend="italic">The Boycott</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. The Arab states would:</p>
                        <p>a. remove restrictions on transiting the Suez Canal, including those on Israel vessels,</p>
                        <p>b. cease the “secondary boycott”, defined as attempts to prevent trade between Israel and non-Arab countries, including termination of all pressure on non-Arab firms trading with Israel,</p>
                        <p>c. abolish the Arab League Boycott offices and all legislation rising therefrom.</p>
                        <p>2. The Arab states would not be pressed to engage in direct trade with Israel.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">V. The Form in Which a Settlement Might Be Embodied, and the Guarantees to the Parties</p>
                        <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Instruments of Settlement</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Permanent frontiers should be established by re-negotiation of the Armistice Agreements in accordance with the provision in the Agreements for modification by consent of both parties. The <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> should continue to supervise the boundaries as long as necessary. The new frontiers should be noted in any guarantee decided upon.</p>
                        <p>2. The whole settlement need not be covered in a single document. Different means should be used for the different components, possibly as follows:</p>
                        <p>a. <hi rend="italic">Territorial.</hi> The territorial settlement to be embodied in a revision of the Armistice Agreements (see above).</p>
                        <p>b. <hi rend="italic">Jordan Waters.</hi> A separate agreement would be made between the parties on the development of the Jordan Valley and the operation of the unified scheme.</p>
                        <p>c. <hi rend="italic">Refugees.</hi> A settlement providing for repatriation and compensation could be contained in a letter from the Israel Government to the Secretary-General of the U.N., referring to the 1948 resolution<note n="6" xml:id="d13fn6">On November 19, 1948, the General Assembly unanimously adopted, at its 163d plenary meeting, General Assembly Resolution 212 (III), which granted relief assistance for the period ending August 31, 1949, to Palestine refugees of all communities. For text, see U.N. doc. <gloss target="#t_A1">A</gloss>/PV. 163.</note> and giving details of Israel’s intention to carry it out.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_41" n="41" facs="0069"/>
                        <p>d. <hi rend="italic">Jerusalem.</hi> Arrangements for Jerusalem and the Holy Places would be the subject of a U.N. resolution.</p>
                        <p>e. <hi rend="italic">Communications.</hi> Free ports and transit arrangements would be the subject of direct agreements between the parties.</p>
                        <p>f. <hi rend="italic">The Blockade.</hi> The Arab states would dissolve the Arab League Boycott Committees and give informal assurances that they intended to put an end to their secondary boycott.</p>
                        <p>g. While treaties of peace between Israel and the Arab states remain our ultimate objective, the state of Arab public opinion does not make it feasible to insist upon such treaties as an immediate objective. We should endeavor to bring about to the maximum extent possible permanent arrangements which would provide the substance, as distinguished from the form, of peace. It should be our objective to obtain the termination of the state of belligerency between the countries both to remove the basis for the Suez Canal blockade and the secondary boycott and to justify to the U.S. and U.K. public and law makers the security guarantees and substantial financial contributions required. The termination of belligerency could be provided for in the revision of the Armistice Agreements (see a above) and would involve the revocation of any Arab legislation based on the existence of a state of belligerency.</p>
                        <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Security Guarantees</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. It will be necessary for the United States and United Kingdom and possibly Turkey and France, to guarantee the frontiers to be established between Israel and the Arab states against alteration by force. (See attached draft treaty which will require further legal study.)<note n="7" xml:id="d13fn7">Attached to the source text but not printed. Documentation concerning the preparation of plans to guarantee frontiers is in Department of State, <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> Files: Lot 59 D 518, Alpha Treaty: Successive drafts of Legal Aspects—Forms and Guarantees.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. The Guarantee would not cover other aspects of the settlement. Nor would it come into operation in the case of frontier incidents not involving the occupation of territory. Such incidents, however, if sufficiently serious would bring into operation the commitment of the parties to consult together. The guarantors might inform the Arab states and Israel that they are prepared to discuss the means of implementing the guarantee.</p>
                        <p>3. The participating powers might offer one treaty to Israel embodying the guarantee and a separate similar treaty to each Arab state. Should the Arab states be unwilling to sign treaties with the Western Powers, a unilateral guarantee might be extended to them and the offer of a treaty left open. Should the Arab states refuse to accept a settlement involving a treaty between Israel and the Western Powers, other means of guaranteeing Israel’s security would be considered.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_42" n="42" facs="0070"/>
                        <p>4. Any guarantee of the division of Jordan waters required would be considered separately in connection with the Jordan waters agreements.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">VI. The Roles of France, Turkey and the United Nations</p>
                        <p>1. France should not be included in the planning or initial approach to the parties but should be informed of the proposals at the time of the approach to Jordan. (See II, 4, above.) France should be included in the arrangements for the final settlement and should participate in the guarantees, unless the Arab states or Israel reject her participation.</p>
                        <p>2. Turkey would not be included in the planning or in the initial approach to the two sides but may be informed at the same time as the French. It would be desirable for Turkey to participate in the guarantee envisaged unless this is resisted by the parties.</p>
                        <p>3. The U.N. would be involved in the machinery of a settlement, for example in supervision of frontiers and Holy Places. The U.N. should therefore take note of the settlement at some stage, perhaps by accepting a P.C.C. report on it. But the U.S. and U.K. guarantees would have to provide for their execution independently of U.N. action.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">VII. Cost of the Operation</p>
                        <p>A. As inducements to a resolution of the Arab-Israel problem, it is anticipated that it would be necessary for the United States and the United Kingdom to provide assistance in addition to present and already projected commitments (development assistance, <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> relief and rehabilitation, and the unified development of the Jordan Valley).

While we were convinced of genuine interest among influential Israelis in seeking favorable conclusion, actual negotiations hit repeated snags both on points of principle and details of water calculations.</p>
                        <p>Main points of difficulty were: (1) The quantity of river water proposed for Israel; and (2) use of Lake Tiberias.</p>
                        <p>Concerning (1) Israelis insisted Jordan underground supplies estimated by them at 100 to 200 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">MCM</gloss> be included in Jordanian share. Israelis also took strong exception to B-Harza<note n="3" xml:id="d14fn3">See <ref target="#d8fn2">footnote 2, Document 8</ref>.</note> allowance of only 3 percent for uncropped land in irrigable area. Israel also rejected thesis that all Arab lands should be served and Israel receive remainder. It was evident that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> looks for a larger share than we prepared admit, equivalent to substantially all the upper Jordan flow. Re (2), which may be just as important as quantity, it was evident <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> feared Tiberias storage might be used in some way as a lever to force territorial concessions or adjustments unfavorable to Israel. Furthermore, Israeli engineers now claim total Tiberias storage capacity required to meet needs of Israels own water development program and that accommodation Yarmuk surplus in Tiberias would compel Israel construct excessively expensive storage facilities elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> emphasized that function of water master would have to be strictly limited to mechanical control.</p>
                        <p>In effort meet Israel partially on quantity, <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> proposed diversion allocation from rivers of 430 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">MCM</gloss> plus Huleh reclamation water approximating 62 or total 492 for Israel, permitting Israeli diversion ex-basin at Banat Yaqub. This proposal unacceptable to Israel.</p>
                        <p>With respect incorporation groundwater in Jordanian allotment <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> proposed that Israel agree to presently proposed share for <pb xml:id="pg_44" n="44" facs="0072"/>Jordan with assurances US Government would undertake exhaustive explorations for groundwater during given period, and that any amount thus derived would result in release of river water to Israel.</p>
                        <p>To assuage Israel’s apprehension re polit implication Tiberias storage <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> assured <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> he prepared give Prime Minister a letter stating no such implications exist and further to incorporate in all agreements a firm proviso that Tiberias storage would neither prejudice status quo nor provide basis for future efforts to do so. We understand this assurance has had marked effect on Israel’s attitude toward Tiberias use, but no definitive understanding was achieved. While Israel may later agree on basis such assurances <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>’s present position remains unfavorable to use of Tiberias.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> indicated it would be interested in considering plan for partial allocations leaving unallocated balance to be divided after three to five years. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> did not signify interest but privately feels some such approach in final showdown may be productive if Arabs objection total plan are serious.</p>
                        <p>While in Jerusalem <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>, Gardiner and <persName corresp="#p_BRG1">Barnes</persName> called on General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> to explain plan and progress.<note n="4" xml:id="d14fn4">A summary record of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>’s conversation of January 31 with General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> is in Department of State, Central Files, 684A.85322/1–3155.</note> In course general discussion General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> stated that proposed diversions at Banat Yaqub and Adasiya are directly linked in his present opinion and that permission to go ahead with one would necessarily be coupled with similar permission for the other. This assumed in both instances that necessary assurances would be given as to protection of local property rights, water use and similar factors. <persName>Burns</persName> also said that after study he would not be able to supply earlier Bennike finding re milit advantage to Israel. If obligated to make decision now on Banat Yaqub it probably would be favorable to project resumption. However he had no intention making any decision at present and certainly not while <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> negotiations under way. In event of any future Security Council action he said he would be guided by positions of France, Britain, United States and would be disinclined to move unless these countries indicated they wished him to.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>’s attitude so far more hopeful than those of technicians and advisers. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> however seems to be in some difficulties with his colleagues and the country in general. Cabinet crisis impended due dispute over current budget, and because of alleged failure of <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>’s foreign policy. Israelis are disturbed at recent events in Egypt, Iraq and Syria and even more concerned at policy of United States which appears to them to be one of appeasement <pb xml:id="pg_45" n="45" facs="0073"/>of Arabs regardless of Israeli rights and interests. Problem remains to convince Israelis that their interests lie in solving JISR Banat Yaqub problem through agreement and in otherwise accommodating themselves to measures that will permit equitable division of water to be enforced to satisfaction of all interests concerned.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The talks with <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> resulted in agreement ad referendum on the lines which a settlement should take and the approaches to the parties. Firming-up talks begin in London February 28.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed, ad referendum, that:</p>
                        <p>1. The Turko-Iraq agreement has resulted in a shake-up of Arab state relations, upon which we may be able to capitalize—or which might set us back. In any event we should be ready to act quickly.</p>
                        <p>2. While treaties of peace between Israel and the Arabs remain our ultimate objective, the state of Arab public opinion might not permit such treaties at present. We should, therefore, aim for: (a) termination of the state of belligerency, and (b) permanent arrangements which would provide the substance, if not the form, of peace.</p>
                        <p>3. A U.S.-U.K. (and possibly French and Turkish) guarantee of the frontiers to be agreed upon is essential as an inducement and should take the form of separate treaties with each of the cooperating countries.</p>
                        <p>4. The settlement should include:</p>
                        <p>a. Territorial adjustments with some cessions by Israel, including a small triangular piece near the southern tip of the <pb xml:id="pg_46" n="46" facs="0074"/>Negev with an overpass for a road from Cairo to Amman involving no substantial interference with Israel’s interests there.</p>
                        <p>b. Repatriation of Arab refugees by Israel numbering up to 75,000.</p>
                        <p>c…..</p>
                        <p>d. Compensation to Arab refugees by Israel for their expropriated real estate, at reduced scale and to be paid in such a way as to promote area development.</p>
                        <p>e. U.S. and U.K. to work for adoption by <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> of resolution similar to former Swedish plan for international supervision of Holy Places ….</p>
                        <p>f. Egypt to drop Suez blockade and all Arab countries to end secondary boycott (i.e., sanctions against firms of third countries doing business with Israel).</p>
                        <p>5. The time table for the launching of the effort for a settlement would be:</p>
                        <p>a. Sir <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony Eden</persName> is visiting <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> in Cairo on February 20 on his way to Bangkok and will indicate to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> our desire to see Egypt develop into a position of increasing influence, which requires a solution of the Palestine problem. He would indicate also (in accordance with your suggestion to <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName>) the benefits to the Arab countries of acting toward that end now.</p>
                        <p>b. <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName>, who arrives in Egypt the end of February, will follow through with a presentation of the U.S.-U.K. views to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> during March.</p>
                        <p>c. If Egypt proves cooperative, the U.S. and the U.K. would inform France and Turkey of the general nature of our efforts and seek their support. Approximately at the same time an approach would be made to Jordan.</p>
                        <p>d. A day or two later we would approach Israel telling them that we have reason to believe that the Egyptians will prove cooperative and urging the Israelis to agree to a settlement along the general lines that have been formulated.</p>
                        <p>6. For the purpose of keeping the Israelis as calm as possible during the next critical couple of months, you might send a message to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> along the lines of the attached draft.<note n="2" xml:id="d15fn2">The draft message, drafted by <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> and dated February 4, is not attached to the source text but, together with a revised draft dated February 7, is <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>It is recommended that:</p>
                        <p>1. You send the <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> message. (Tab A)</p>

                        <p>446. For Ambassador and <persName corresp="#p_WGTD1">White</persName>. Dept currently engaged in formulating proposals for consideration in further US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> discussions re Arab-Israel problem. Among topics are refugee repatriation, compensation, resettlement. Your considered replies to fol questions wld be most helpful:</p>
                        <p>1. Assumption has been postulated Israel can be persuaded, in context general settlement, accept between fifty and seventy-five thousand Arab refugees for settlement in Israel (possibly up to one hundred fifty thousand if Gaza strip ceded to Israel). Such refugees could not be “repatriated” in sense returning their former homes. However they might be usefully settled in parts Negev and on terraced hillsides in Northern Israel. Cld you assist us in pinpointing actual sites such agricultural resettlement? Any opportunities for refugees some of whom skilled find urban livelihoods?</p>
                        <p>2. Proposal made Israel wld provide land for returning refugees with <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> providing funds develop such land. Do you think this feasible? What wld be realistic figure for <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> contribution to Israel on a per family basis? Wld <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> be safe in turning money over to <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> with accounting on post audit basis only?</p>
                        <p>3. Wld it be practical or feasible urge Israel extend special guarantees re civil and other rights to returning Arabs?</p>
                        <p>4. Wld appreciate Embs further thoughts re amount nature and timing of <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> contributions to refugee compensation fund. On assumption total of $300 million to be paid out over five year period what cld Israel economy contribute by way of goods readily translatable into cash?</p>

                        <p>To summarize position end Cairo talks, solution Water Division unresolved but reduced to two formulas on which <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> prepared stand. First, contemplating immediate allocation of total estimated supply, proposed 35 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">MCM</gloss> Lebanon, 1320 Syria, 520 Jordan, remainder over 400 Israel. Second, contemplates partial allocations 35 Lebanon, 132 Syria, 375 Jordan, 350 Israel, leaving about 200 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">MCM</gloss> to be divided after three-year experience period. These quantities are all from rivers only, not including locally developed resources. Arithmetical summation of quantities depends on complex calculations of return flows, explaining differences in amounts of two proposals.</p>
                        <p>Arabs agreed in principle on need make use Tiberias but insisted on greater security storage on Yarmuk than economy alone justifies. Six Yarmuk storage may be principal bargaining point Amman. Syria disappointed power potential proposed by B–Harza<note n="3" xml:id="d17fn3">See <ref target="#d8fn2">footnote 2, Document 8</ref>.</note> and some alternative power proposals may have to be discussed Damascus.</p>
                        <p>No serious questions raised as to neutral authority. Although this subject not discussed in detail, Arabs acceptance of necessity was clear.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> inquired as to the Secretary’s views on the letter drafted for him to transmit to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> in order to <pb xml:id="pg_50" n="50" facs="0078"/>reassure him of the Secretary’s continued personal study of the problem of Israel’s security position.<note n="2" xml:id="d18fn2">Reference is presumably to the February 7 draft cited in <ref target="#d15fn2">footnote 2, Document 15</ref>. It is identical to the message sent on February 14 (see <ref target="#d22">Document 22</ref>), except the last two sentences which read as follows: “You may rest assured that I will communicate with you on a more concrete and detailed basis just as soon as our study of the problem permits. In the meantime I felt that you should know of the encouragement which I feel as a result of our work to date.”</note> The Secretary replied that the letter seemed too optimistic and, as a holding operation, inadequate. He asked what basis we had for using the word “encouraging”. He did not know of any developments in the Arab-Israel situation that justified the use of this term. Did we mean simply that we were encouraged by our own mental processes? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> replied that the purpose of the letter was to assure the Israeli Prime Minister that he was not being given a “run around” but that the Secretary himself was at work on the problem. The Secretary inquired as to whether it would not be desirable instead of a letter to issue a public statement, perhaps similar to that given some months ago in Parliament by Sir <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony Eden</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> had kept the lid on the situation pretty resolutely and the borders were quiet. The Secretary suggested that he might say that we were working on the problem; that there was a lot to be done; meanwhile, in view of the 1950 Tripartite Declaration, which he herewith reaffirmed, no one should feel that he could commit aggression with impunity. Both Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRA1">Hare</persName> felt that reaffirmation of the Tripartite Declaration even in this form needed a “peg” which was missing at the present moment.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then inquired whether there was not a good deal of risk vis-à-vis the Arabs in sending a letter only to <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>. Would it not be desirable to send a letter to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> as well? There followed a discussion of the possible contents of a personal letter to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> and what <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony Eden</persName> might say to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> in Cairo on his way to Bangkok. The Secretary felt that it should be stated to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> that the United States Government had been able to provide military aid to Iraq because the latter commanded bases highly strategic in any defense concept for the Middle East and because Iraq had no common frontier with Israel. With respect to other Arab states, however, the U.S. Government was sharply limited in the possibility of providing arms aid due to: (1) Israel’s understandable apprehensions and (2) Arab preoccupation with the Palestine problem to the point of subordinating to it the Communist danger. It was finally agreed that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LEB1">Lawson</persName> at Tel Aviv would deliver a message from the Secretary by means of a Note Verbale or an Aide-Mémoire. Delivery would be accompanied by a special request to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> to observe not only the secrecy of its content but secrecy of its existance.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_51" n="51" facs="0079"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> raised the question of possible discussions within the U.S. Government prior to his own forthcoming visit to London. Should the London trip take place without some assurance of: (1) a treaty of guaranty of the type discussed during the <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> meetings at Washington; (2) special economic aid as inducement to the Arabs; notably aid to Egypt for the High Aswan dam; (3) U.S. contribution in the form of a long-term loan to Israel to enable Israel to pay some $200 million in compensation to the Palestine Arab refugees and (4) military aid to Egypt? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRA1">Hare</persName> interjected that Egypt would have to be “bought” by this type of aid. The Secretary indicated that there should be no discussion with other branches of the U.S. Government until after he had talked to the President. He inquired how compensation to the refugees would be financed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> replied that he had in mind a loan from the U.S. Government, contributions by American Jewry and a diversion or funding of German reparations. A discussion followed regarding figures submitted by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> on the projected costs of present aid programs in the Near East and the additional estimated costs of operation “Alpha”, the grand total being over a billion dollars. The Secretary felt these figures to be depressingly large but asked that they be prepared for him to use in a discussion with the President on Monday in a form which would clearly show (1) what the U.S. Government would be expected to pay in various forms of aid to the Near East in any event and (2) what the additional costs of Alpha would be. He asked that no letter be sent to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> until he had talked to the President.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRA1">Hare</persName> asked whether the suggested approach by Sir <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony Eden</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> should proceed as planned. The Secretary replied in the affirmative assuming that the President concurred as he expected he would.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary also asked that in preparation for the Monday conference with the President he be furnished a paragraph on the question of the Treaty of Guaranty of a boundary settlement.<note n="3" xml:id="d18fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> on Monday, February 14, submitted a memorandum to <persName>Dulles</persName> for his conference with the President. Specifically, <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> suggested that the Secretary might wish to say that the American and British officials who had been discussing the prospects for an Arab-Israeli settlement had concluded that the United States and United Kingdom would have to negotiate separate treaties guaranteeing the agreed borders of all the parties, and that an Alpha settlement would require the United States to make substantial additional economic contributions in the Near East, totaling over $1 billion during the next 5 years.

As of possible background use while you are conducting negotiations Arab capitals, Embassy submits following preliminary forecast Israel Government reaction two formulas set forth second paragraph Cairo’s 1141 to Department repeated Tel Aviv as 154:<note n="2" xml:id="d19fn2">

                        <p>While it is correct that there are some Israel political elements disposed reach water agreement (or at least to avoid onus failure negotiations), there is little evidence that this disposition extends to point of “giving up” any substantial amount of Jordan water to the <gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss>. Reasons for lukewarm character response Israel moderate elements appear to be:</p>
                        <p>1. In view assertions Israel experts (who have both technical and political influence) that <gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> actual irrigable area lower than our estimates and that inadequate provision made for underground water potential, neither <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> nor other Israelis appear convinced validity river allocation to <gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> set forth your January 30 proposal.<note n="3" xml:id="d19fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> summarized his water allocation proposal, which the Israelis found unacceptable, in <ref target="#d14">Document 14</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Resistances both from <gloss target="#t_Mapai1">Mapai</gloss> “old guard” and from large segments public would be very strong to large waiver Israel of Jordan water, which would be interpreted as permanent sacrifice precious part of national patrimony. This factor especially important at moment when Israel entering election campaign period.</p>
                        <p>3. With evolution US policy in the area at a transition point where it appears (to Israelis) to jeopardize Israel’s security position, there is little or no compensatory weight to (1) and (2) above from standpoint considerations improving Israel’s relations with US and the Arab states.</p>
                        <p>The tentative conclusion reached from foregoing is that the chances are negligible of obtaining Israel concurrence to total allocation formula.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, a partial allocation approach would appear to hold greater promise of acceptance in Israel. The immediate and foreseeable objections which Israelis may raise to your precise formula are: (1) Total allocations for Lebanon and Syria but only partial for Israel, (2) small amount of “new water” to Israel, and (3) bad precedent for future allocations inherent in Israeli acceptance of 39.2 percent ratio under partial allocation.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_53" n="53" facs="0081"/>
                        <p>Nevertheless, partial allocation has several attractions to Israel, including prospect US financial participation with resultant acceleration getting water on the land, amicable settlement Banat Yaacov controversy, and avoidance onus obstructionism before world opinion. In terms short-term economic development, your partial allocation Israel would permit (assuming Hula drainage savings equate Hula Basin diversion) allocation 130 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">MCM</gloss> triangle–Tiberias–Beisan areas, with balance 220 diversion to Beit Netufa for use coastal plain and northern Negev. This is all Israelis could possibly utilize next several years and much more than they will if left to their own devices and funds. It is reasonable to expect that during that period actual experience in lower Jordan (as well as with storage possibilities Beit Netufa) may bring views of interested parties closer together re distribution unallocated balance.</p>

                        <p>5. I discussed with the President the substance of the memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Francis Russell</persName> on February 14, pointing out that before proceeding we should know in a general way whether the President might consider it feasible to recommend, if a settlement were arrived at, that the U.S. and U.K. would in effect jointly guarantee the territorial stability and if we would be willing to increase our contributions to the area to an amount which would in substance double them from the present rate of around $100,000,000 a year to about $200,000,000, or in other words $1,000,000,000 over say a five-year period. The President said, of course, he did not want to <pb xml:id="pg_54" n="54" facs="0082"/>commit himself and that he felt somewhat appalled by the mounting total of requests for foreign aid. However, he agreed that we should make an all-out effort to get a settlement, if possible, before the elections of ’56, and he felt we might proceed to develop further the project. This was not, of course, any committal; that he would have to study the plan in detail and hear the views of Treasury, Budget, etc. I said we did not want or expect any committal at the present time, but that we had not wanted to proceed to develop the project beyond the present U.S.–U.K. study without his knowing in general what it might entail.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Begin Message</hi>—Some time has passed since, upon Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>’s telling me of your concern over Israel’s sense of isolation and insecurity, I asked him to inform you of my sympathetic awareness of that problem and my intention to give it my careful study. I am sending you this message so that you may know that the problem has had my continuing personal attention and that we are making good progress in formulating the possibilities of appropriate and effective steps which the United States might take. I need not emphasize to you the many questions which arise in the course of such an analysis and the study and discussions which are required. In view of the constitutional requirements involved in a foreign policy dealing with long term American security commitments and the attention which must be given to the interests of all countries, which, if we are to have success, would be involved, any solution to this problem is, of necessity, a time consuming process.</p>
                        <p>Nor need I stress, I am sure, how essential it is that the approach to this problem take place in a period of relative calm. The policy of moderation which you have been pursuing has been, and <pb xml:id="pg_56" n="56" facs="0084"/>will continue to be, most helpful to us. Progress in the present discussions on a Unified Jordan Valley Plan will also be of great importance.</p>
                        <p>You may rest assured that I will communicate with you on a more concrete and detailed basis just as soon as progress on the problem permits. <hi rend="italic">End Message</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> thinking reveals no interest in and little sense of obligation toward resettlement Arab refugees in Israel territory and it may be assumed, therefore, that acceptance proposal to resettle any large number in this country would be contingent on other phases general settlement being so favorable to Israel in tangible terms improved security, lifting Arab blockade, opening up of nearby markets, et cetera, as to make “sacrifice” desirable in national interest. Department in better position than Embassy to weigh these considerations as well as the advantages of timing any approach on this point with overall policy developments.</p>
                        <p>With Negev unusable except with water which is being developed for Jewish settlers and coastal plain already largely settled, best prospect Arab settlement would be on hillsides in the north near Lebanese border. Some Arabs have been withdrawn from these areas for security reasons but change of policy <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> possible in framework general settlement which might tangibly reduce security problem. Any pinpointing these sites or estimate of settlement capacities would require survey work not possible under security limitations Arab-Israel project.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_57" n="57" facs="0085"/>
                        <p>Opportunities for refugees find urban employment believed to be very limited and would depend largely expansion general level Israel economic activity which might prove possible if enough external funds poured in here next several years [as result of] implementation united water development and as result accelerated industrial activity responsive to removal Arab economic boycott. Modest opportunities absorption might result from redefinition eligibility under “reunion of family scheme”, which however resulted in admission to Israel only 2382 Arabs between 1949 and 1952.</p>
                        <p>Re Gaza strip, we doubt whether any country really wants this area under current circumstances because there are no resources to go with people located there. Only economic possibility permanent settlement any large number Gaza strip would appear to be along lines making some Litani floodwaters available to that area. This possibility mentioned only because <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>’s recent discussion with <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> indicated that Israel might not be averse to use its reservoir and transit system for Arab refugee purposes and because Lebanon might not have same strong objection use of Litani waters for Arab refugees as it has for use in Israel.<note n="3" xml:id="d23fn3">See <ref target="#d14fn2">footnote 2, Document 14</ref>.</note> While Litani water applied Gaza strip would be expensive it might not be much more so than Jordan waters which will be applied by Israel to contiguous Negev area.</p>
                        <p>New obstacle resettlement here Arab refugees is the resumption of large-scale immigration to Israel. Finance Minister Eshkol in budget address last week said that Israel population would increase 100,000 this year, of which 60,000 new immigrants. This change <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> policy directed primarily at transfer here of North Africans due to deterioration political situation Tunis, Algiers, and Morocco. Although joint statement yesterday Jewish-Agency-Cabinet indicates financial limitations may result smaller number than target, it is apparent that Israel’s absorption capacity will be severely strained this new movement. It may be taken as axiomatic that in distribution available land, water and other facilities, these Jewish immigrants will have priority over any Arab refugees.</p>
                        <p>In any analysis prospects Israel cooperation in settling or easing refugee problem it seems clear that no <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> will make concessions which will oppose its present basic policy of accepting persecuted Jewish immigrants. If Israel agrees to use what it considers its water for purposes aiding Arab refugees it is likely to consider request for resettlement refugees in Israel as additional concession its part.</p>
                        <p>2. We believe <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would find financing through strengthened <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> setup more acceptable than through <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> with which Israel has severed all connections and which is regarded here as having Arab viewpoint. (We understand that <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> contemplates <pb xml:id="pg_58" n="58" facs="0086"/>under unified development plan US financing through <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> for Arab side but directly through <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> Israel side.)</p>
                        <p>In view different living standards and way of life do not believe Israel settlement costs are useful in connection Arab resettlement. Suggest instead that as a rule of thumb Department use family cost estimates prepared by <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> for Jordan Valley settlement.</p>
                        <p>3. We believe that the most obtainable from Israel would be a statement that it would extend to returning Arabs the same civil and other rights enjoyed by Arabs already resident in the country.</p>
                        <p>4. With US or <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> financing raw material and fuel import components Embassy believes it would be possible for Israel industry to contribute added value $5 million the first year rising gradually to $10 million in final year or total net contribution $35–$40 million. Greatest possibility appears to be in field of building materials, including cement, glass, plywood and masonite, and plumbing fixtures, which presumably could be absorbed in the Arab resettlement projects outside Israel. There also appears to be some unused capacity in textile production. Jeeps could be made available from Kaiser–Willys assembly plant although added value would be much smaller than 30 percent average used by Embassy foregoing calculation. Translation goods into cash case of building materials would presumably take the form of payment by US or <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> into a fund from financial appropriations made available for resettlement with possible redistribution cash to refugees on an individual basis according to their valid claims for compensation.</p>

                        <p> “I attach copies of my telegrams from Washington Nos. 311 and 312, and of the record of my meeting with Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> and members of the State Department on January 27. I suggest that you might speak to Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> on the following lines.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_60" n="60" facs="0088"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Effect of the Arab/Israel dispute on the Middle East</p>
                        <p>You are concerned at the damage which the tension between the Arab states and Israel is doing to the Arab world. Its most obvious effect is that it draws out the sufferings of nearly a million Arab refugees; but its concealed workings are wider and even more serious. It offers unlimited opportunity for Soviet designs on Arab society and on the freedom of the Arab countries; and it blinds the Arab peoples and many of their statesmen to the real danger which threaténs them—communist infiltration. As long as the Arabs nourish an active resentment against Israel’s very existence, their responsible leaders will find it very difficult to turn their full attention and energies to the positive tasks of reconstruction and to create the conditions of stability out of which powerful nations might emerge.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Removal of the main obstacle to fruitful cooperation with. the West</p>
                        <p>H.M. Government want to see a strong and progressive Egypt exercising a constructive influence in the Eastern Mediterranean. You admire <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s efforts to develop the country and pull it together, and you are genuinely anxious to help him. The same is true of the United States Government. But the dispute with Israel hampers our efforts to help them in many ways. For example, both the Americans and we are anxious to help <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> over military supplies, but our hands are tied whilst the dispute with Israel continues. We have to defend ourselves against the charge that we are encouraging an arms race and increasing the instability of the Middle East, and we are liable to have to justify every delivery of arms to Israel’s immediate neighbours. Egypt suffers particularly from this, for she has a common frontier with Israel.</p>
                        <p>The continued dispute with Israel also makes it difficult for us to assist <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> in his plans to develop Egypt’s economy.</p>
                        <p>If <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> could help you and Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> work for a settlement, the main impediment to Western cooperation would be removed and his aims for Egypt’s future would be greatly furthered.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. An appeal to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        </p>
                        <p>You have not spoken of this possibility to any other of the parties to the conflict. You believe you can speak frankly to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> because you know he has the realism to recognise that Israel has come to stay, and you believe that he has the courage to lead the Egyptians and other Arab peoples away from their sterile recriminations towards a settlement that will release their energies and strengthen their self-confidence.</p>
                        <p>It is clear from his talks with Mr. Nutting last year that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> understands the damage that the dispute is causing. You have been <pb xml:id="pg_61" n="61" facs="0089"/>glad to see Egyptian influence used effectively to bring the other Arab states to adopt a positive attitude to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Eric Johnston</persName>’s proposals for the Jordan waters. This has raised Egypt’s stature in the eyes of the world. The task of achieving a wider settlement is a challenge to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s statesmanship, as it is to the statesmanship of Britain and the United States. If all three of us worked together we would have a chance of achieving something.</p>
                        <p>You therefore ask whether <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> would be disposed to accept the kind of settlement that is now practicable and to help us work for it. You are not trying to impose anything on him: you are convinced that a settlement is an urgent necessity and need his help. He can rely on our discretion and we are trusting his, for secrecy is vital at this stage.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">5. The argument for urgency</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> may well accept all this in principle but say that the time is not ripe. The following arguments may be used to convince him of urgency:</p>
                        <p>(a) Events are moving fast in the Middle East, and not all of them are favourable to peace. We can not afford much longer to run the risks which this dispute entails. Political weakness in Syria and Jordan might become very dangerous, and some act of Israeli impatience is always possible.</p>
                        <p>(b) The policy of the present United States administration had had the effect, over the last two years, of deflating Israel to a large extent. They have refused her arms and resisted her attempts to obtain defense agreements and guarantees. Financial assistance from the United States, both public and private, has fallen off. As a result, Israel is probably more likely now than at any previous time to contemplate a reasonable settlement.</p>
                        <p>(c) But this policy, though it survived the recent Congressional elections, cost the Republican Party many votes. It is very doubtful whether it can be maintained firmly through the next Presidential election. In 1956 Palestine will again be a factor in United States domestic politics, and there is a danger that the Republicans will be forced to match Democratic promises of measures to please American Jewry. It is in the Arabs’ own interest to take advantage of the present situation in which the United States is able to put pressure on Israel, by working towards a settlement this year. If they do not do so, Israel may get what she wants out of the United States without having to earn it by making concessions.</p>
                        <p>(d) You realise, of course, that gestures will be required from Israel. You are not thinking of a one-sided move by <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>. All you are saying is that you believe the next six or eight months to be probably the most hopeful in which to secure reasonable offers from Israel; and that, if he is interested, you are prepared to pursue this further.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_62" n="62" facs="0090"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">6. Further discussion depending on <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s reaction</p>
                        <p>(a) <hi rend="italic">If <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> is receptive</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You do not want to make definite proposals at this stage. But now that you know he is interested, you will give instructions for something to be worked out with the United States and let him know what we think as soon as possible. You could say that Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>’ ideas on the subject coincide pretty well with your own. In general you have in mind a slightly smaller Israel, but do not think the Arabs could expect large transfers of territory—certainly nothing like the U.N. partition resolution of 1947.<note n="4" xml:id="d24fn4">For text of General Assembly Resolution 181 (II) concerning a future government for Palestine, which the General Assembly adopted on November 29, 1947, see U.N. doc. <gloss target="#t_A1">A</gloss>/519.

The Arabs would have to abandon their economic warfare, including restrictions on transit through the Suez Canal. But they would not necessarily have to enter into direct relations with Israel, and we would do all we could to make the settlement as palatable as possible to Arab opinion. The Israelis would find it difficult to make the necessary concessions, and we should obviously have to discuss these with them first, unless <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> feels that he can negotiate directly with the Israelis. However we tackle it, secrecy will be of the essence; and we should be glad to hear <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s view on the best means of conducting negotiations and what roles we and he can play.</p>

                        <p>691. Re <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 456, February 14.<note n="2" xml:id="d25fn2">
                                <ref target="#d22">Document 22</ref>.</note> Message delivered personally and orally to Prime Minister who although seemingly somewhat harrassed as result of past few days quizzing by Foreign Affairs Committee and Security Committee of Knesset was obviously very much pleased at receiving Secretary’s assuring words. He expressed his appreciation of message which he said was very helpful. He regarded it as token of understanding by Secretary of Israel Government’s position and indication that formula was being sought for relief of Israel’s sense of isolation and insecurity. He expressed pleasure at recognition of his policy of moderation and his efforts to maintain a period of calm.</p>
                        <p>He accepted opportunity of replying to the two principal points of the message, that is (1) need for period of relative calm, and (2) progress in unified Jordan Valley plan negotiations.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the first item, he said he fully appreciated the need for calm and hoped that situation would continue but was confident it could not continue indefinitely. He said that whereas Israel was maintaining calm attitude “positive actions were occurring all around Israel, in which Israel was not participant and which further emphasized her isolation”. (He was obviously referring to the Turco-Iraqi pact and the US supplying arms to Iraq.) He said he had no conception of what plan Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> might have in mind nor was he pressing for any details or indications at this time. However, he was hopeful that a plan would develop which would be useful for area peace and would also be acceptable to Israel.</p>
                        <p>He stated that Israel’s self-restraint had been particularly difficult recently and hoped that too great a strain would not be put upon Israel people for too long a time. He commented at some length on the fact that the Syrian-Israel border had become very active recently and concluded that this represented action approved by Syrian Government. He arrived at this conclusion on grounds that heretofore border had been very well policed by Syrian troops thus preventing irregulars and marauders to operate to any great extent. At all times the Syrian military forces had been well disciplined. Now, however, it was the Syrian military forces which were causing the trouble and obviously this was done with the approval <pb xml:id="pg_64" n="64" facs="0092"/>of the Syrian Government. The Prime Minister said he was under considerable pressure as result of these developments and the Israeli public is asking the government whether it is not time to “give the Syrians a lesson”.</p>
                        <p>Most of the Jordan-Israel border had been quiet with exception one sector he said. The Prime Minister was quite upset over a <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> decision which condemned both Jordan and Israel for an exchange of military action recently whereas there was no question but that the action was started by Jordan. (Presumably reference Jerusalem’s 187 to Department).<note n="3" xml:id="d25fn3">The Consulate General in Jerusalem reported in telegram 187 on February 10 that the Mixed Armistice Commission, meeting in emergency session the previous day, had decided that both Israel and Jordan should share responsibility for incidents that had occurred on January 26 in the Beit Awwa area. (Department of State, Central Files, 684A.85/2–1055)</note> “What do they expect us to do when we are attacked—do they believe that we should run away and not respond to such attacks? This we do not believe should reasonably be expected nor do we feel that it would improve the situation. I am going to speak to General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> about this matter as soon as he returns to Jerusalem as we feel it is unfair on the part of <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> to censure us in cases of this kind. “Following these remarks he said he thought that it was highly essential that increased efforts to maintain a “period of relative calm” on the border should be made by the Arabs and in that connection was it not possible that the “US Ambassador in Damascus appeal to the Syrian Government to control their border troops.”</p>
                        <p>With regard to the unified Jordan plan, he was very much discouraged. He said that he was “shocked” to learn that the plan which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> had left with him prior to his departure for the Arab capitals had now been changed radically to the disadvantage of Israel. Although the Israel Government was not prepared to accept the plan (January 30)<note n="4" xml:id="d25fn4">On January 30, the Israelis outlined their objections to <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>’s Jordan Valley plan; see <ref target="#d14">Document 14</ref>.</note> as it stood he considered that it was a basis from which negotiations could start but now apparently Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> had discussed with Arabs a plan which would give Israel even less water. The Prime Minister said, “it would be a sad day if Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> and I should have to part company as result of our inability to agree on an equitable plan for the distribution of Jordan water but Israel cannot give away its vital resources. At no time have we ever agreed that we would supply sufficient water to irrigate every square inch of land in the Jordan Valley. We believe that our estimates of Jordan’s need for water are correct and we believe that not sufficient provision was made for the future use of underground water which is available to Jordan. <pb xml:id="pg_65" n="65" facs="0093"/>Furthermore there are large quantities of water from the Litani River in Lebanon which are going to waste and it seems to us that a fellow Arab state could divert that water for the use of Jordan rather than Israel being required to supply some of its meager water supplies to Jordan”. He fully appreciated the importance of a successful negotiation of a unified plan but at the moment it was obvious that he was greatly discouraged at the prospects.</p>
                        <p>He made it clear that in offering these comments on the two principal points involved he did not in any way wish to discount his great appreciation of the Secretary’s action in sending him this personal message.</p>
                        <p>I said I was pleased to note his appreciation that maintaining a period of calm until a satisfactory formula has been worked out is vital; and that time is necessary to develop such a formula; and that an agreement on the Jordan River plan is of great importance. I assured him that his efforts toward moderation were understood and appreciated and expressed hope they would be successfully continued.</p>

                        <p>As a result of discussions between representatives of the Governments of Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Egypt and of the Government <pb xml:id="pg_67" n="67" facs="0095"/>of the United States, relative to the development of the Jordan River Valley, preliminary understanding has been achieved with respect to major elements of the proposed plan.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of this preliminary memorandum of understanding is to set forth points on which substantive agreement has been reached. It is understood that this formulation is not conclusive and that certain questions remain to be discussed and resolved at a later date.</p>
                        <p>Principles and elements of the proposed program upon which tentative agreement now exists are the following:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. Storage</p>
                        <p>Water of the Jordan and Yarmuk Rivers will be stored and regulated (A) primarily through reservoir facilities to be constructed on the Yarmuk River and (B) through the operation of Lake Tiberias as a reservoir.</p>
                        <p>The importance to Syria and Jordan of the full utilization of the Yarmuk through the construction of a storage dam on the Yarmuk creating a reservoir with a capacity of up to 300 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">MCM</gloss> was recognized. In view of the relationship between storage and security for Arab crops and lands, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> will recommend that the United States contribute $21,600,000 toward the cost of this dam. Flood waters exceeding the storage capacity of this reservoir and irrigation needs will be spilled into Lake Tiberias for release to the Hashimite Kingdom of Jordan.</p>
                        <p>Arrangements concerning the control of the waters shall in no way alter existing territorial rights and claims.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Supervision</p>
                        <p>A neutral body acceptable to all parties will be established to oversee withdrawals and releases of water. Details will be the subject of further discussion.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. Division of the Waters</p>
                        <p>(a) Of the requirements of the Hashimite Kingdom of Jordan, 537 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">MCM</gloss> of water annually will be withdrawn from the Jordan and Yarmuk Rivers. This is in addition to internal resources of wells, springs and wadies within the Kingdom of Jordan.</p>
                        <p>(b) The requirements of Syria totalling 132 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">MCM</gloss> will be withdrawn from the river up to the following amounts—20 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">MCM</gloss> from the Banyas, 22 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">MCM</gloss> from the Jordan and 90 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">MCM</gloss> from the Yarmuk. Provisions will be made for the protection of established irrigation and power interests at Boteiha.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_68" n="68" facs="0096"/>
                        <p>(c) The requirements of Lebanon will be met through withdrawal of 35 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">MCM</gloss> annually from the Hasbani River.</p>
                        <p>It is understood that all quantities expressed above are based upon average annual supply as indicated by existing records of the discharges of the Yarmuk and Jordan Rivers, and may be subject to adjustment, depending upon hydrologic conditions of these 2 rivers.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> had discussions with Israeli officials, February 20–22. Summary minutes of these conversations are <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi>

                        <p>On water division we required minimum 131 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">MCM</gloss> of Jordan River water to meet Arab adjustment 520 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">MCM</gloss> from river. Israel offered guarantee 50 unconditionally at JX plus additional 50 recoverable by Israel if adequate wells supplies developed in Jordan. While Jordan would have prior claim to second 50 conditions imposed by Israel relating to recoverability would in my judgment virtually preclude chance obtaining Arab assent.</p>
                        <p>Re Tiberias Israel position improved somewhat from earlier insistence to storage Yarmuk water in Lake. Now prepared to accept subject to certain conditions which probably but not certainly can be met. Tiberias question deeply involved politically and probably figures more importantly in Israel thinking than quantities.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_69" n="69" facs="0097"/>
                        <p>Re supervision Israel reiterated insistence on minimum possible since present trend is toward division formally leaving control of Jordan and Yarmuk to Israel and Arabs respectively, there is reason believe Israel can be satisfied on this point.</p>
                        <p>It was evident Sharret, Eshkol and others worried by internal political problems which compel them proceed carefully on Jordan River question. Hard bargaining position may have been effort convince Cabinet their toughness and I was informed privately by Kollek and others that final attitude will be more favorable. It is quite possible that Ministers’ inability to make decision on such vital matter without prior approval Cabinet and Party leadership. If this is the case we may have clearer picture of actual position in few days. I have asked Lawson White comment local political aspects separately.<note n="3" xml:id="d28fn3">See <ref target="#d32">Document 32</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>In my judgment despite rigidity Israel leadership wants accept proposal ultimately and we have not yet heard their final word.</p>
                        <p>In discussion Sharret evening prior departure he inquired pointedly about Syrian attitude toward agreement, asking whether I was sure agreement in April would include Syria. In ensuing discussion he said it would be essential for Israel resume work Banat Yacob project not later than June prior Cely [<hi rend="italic">July</hi>] elections. Sharret and Eshkol asked my opinion what would happen if this were done without agreement being concluded.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_Dulte1">Dulte</gloss> 4. At lunch today (February 23), <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> said he had discussed Arab-Israel problem with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> did not react unfavorably but said any settlement would have to be on overall basis and could not be just a settlement of Jordan frontiers. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> implied Egypt has open mind but said problem was one of timing. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> seemed to think what <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had in mind here was Iraqi-Turkish Pact, which apparently is consuming his attention. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> did advance thesis that territorial contiguity with other Arab states was important to Egypt and he indicated that idea of corridor was unsatisfactory.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> US was prepared to assume responsibilities and obligations to bring about settlement this problem (along lines suggested recent Washington talks) but that it must be consummated within next twelve months, and explained why this consideration of timing affected US approach.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> we would like to be able to give <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> support for position of leadership to which he aspired in Arab world but that we could not do this until Arab-Israel problem was settled. I said we had been able to help Iraqis because they had no common border with Israel but that rendering additional assistance to Arab states contiguous to Israel prior to an Arab-Israel settlement was quite a different matter. I said <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> should take these considerations into account.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> said he would advise London on urgency of moving ahead. I mentioned that <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> was going to London to follow up recent Washington talks.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 13. Following account luncheon conversation between Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> on <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> talks:</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> said that [he] was agreeably surprised with friendliness of reception accorded him by <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>. This was first time he had been in Egypt since conclusion Anglo-Egyptian agreement,<note n="2" xml:id="d30fn2">The Anglo-Egyptian Agreement Regarding the Suez Canal Base was signed in Cairo on October 19, 1954. For text, see 210 <gloss target="#t_UNTS1">UNTS</gloss> 3.</note> and he had not been sure just how he would be received. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> was more convinced than ever that Suez Canal base settlement was worth all it had cost. They had discussed Middle East defense problem with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>, and General Harding<note n="3" xml:id="d30fn3">Field Marshal Sir John Harding, Chief of the British Imperial General Staff.</note> had outlined British thinking on Middle East defense strategy. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> had taken line it was in Egypt’s interest to have Middle East defense based on Caucasus rather than Suez just as in Europe <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> wished its defense on Elbe and not the Channel. Everything had gone smoothly with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> agreeing with their ideas until Iraqi-Turkish pact came up. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had been completely impervious to all arguments about desirability this treaty. His general attitude was that Egyptian people would never condone Iraqi-Turkish pact and that it was not in best interests Arab cooperation with West. Anglo-Egyptian agreement had been a very good beginning toward Arab-Western cooperation, but Iraqi-Turkish treaty was completely in wrong direction.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had said that <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName>
                            <note n="4" xml:id="d30fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Adnan Menderes</persName>, Prime Minister of Turkey.</note> had suggested possibility of visiting Cairo, but he, <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>, did not think it would be good idea unless <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName> would scuttle Turkish-Iraqi treaty. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> said he told <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> he felt sure <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName> would not do this and suggested that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> should accept treaty as step in right direction and assume leadership in building support for further cooperative defense efforts. His arguments had been to no avail.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> believed situation hinged on question of leadership in Arab world which <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> obviously desired to assume. His opposition to Iraqi-Turkish treaty really stemmed from fact that another Arab nation had taken lead in concluding collective defense arrangement. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> said he had concluded that while <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> was bound to cause trouble, Iraqi-Turkish treaty should go ahead as desirable step in Middle East defense arrangements.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_72" n="72" facs="0100"/>
                        <p>Secretary asked how <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> expected trouble from <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> to be manifested. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> thought <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> would denounce treaty at time of signature<note n="5" xml:id="d30fn5">Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName> of Turkey and Prime Minister Nuri Said of Iraq signed the Turkish-Iraqi defense pact at Baghdad on February 24. For text, see 233 <gloss target="#t_UNTS1">UNTS</gloss> 199.</note> and that there would be Egyptian efforts in Iraq to bring about downfall of Neri,<note n="6" xml:id="d30fn6">Presumably reference is to Nuri Said.</note> on whom <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had centered all his antagonism. In response to Secretary’s further question, <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> said he doubted Egyptians had capacity to be successful in these activities within Iraq.</p>
                        <p>… <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> said French had also been causing considerable difficulties in regard Iraqi-Turkish pact although French Ambassador London had denied when British raised this with him. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> thought it might be wise for us to make representations to French to effect that treaty should be encouraged as step in right direction.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> said that when he came through Karachi, Mohammed Ali<note n="7" xml:id="d30fn7">Prime Minister of Pakistan.</note> had discussed Turkish-Iraqi pact. As means of getting over difficulty with Egypt, Mohammed Ali suggested possibility enlarging Turko-Pakistani treaty to include Arab nations as possible means bringing about solution difficult problem. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> had advised him that, while this might be good idea at later stage, he felt Turkish-Iraqi defense cooperation should not be delayed but moved ahead resolutely.</p>
                        <p>Subsequently at dinner Mohammed Ali spoke to Secretary about Turkish-Iraqi pact. He said he did not think that Egypt had any right to challenge defensive buildup of the northern tier and felt that the treaty should go ahead. He also spoke of Iranian participation. The Secretary said he had the impression Iran would join as soon as it felt that it could contribute and not be in an inferior position. Ali said that he had the same view.</p>

                        <p>1. Division of waters. Embassy believes that <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>’s position (that he should not return to area until Israelis have agreed to formula for which there is reasonable chance acceptance Arab States) is a sound one and should be maintained. His suggestion that he endeavor obtain Jordan agreement acceptance 482 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">MCM</gloss>s river water with balance to 520 to be made up well drilling appears equitable; would give Israelis the allocation they suggested at working level their June 28 memo;<note n="3" xml:id="d32fn3">Not printed.</note> and would provide <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> water availabilities necessary completion economically sound projects Jordan water with some balance for projects which appear marginal from cost standpoint.</p>
                        <p>2. Use of Tiberias. Key is to find formula which <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> can present to public as representing no further derogation exercise its sovereignty lake and adjacent areas. This explains Israelis insistence delivery be at point beyond Tiberias and reason <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> might not have similar strong objection control point in demilitarized zone which is already subject measure <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> control. Embassy informed by Kollek <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> considering sending Weiner to Washington for consultation with Bureau of Reclamation engineers “friendly to Israel” re control formula. Danger this approach is that Weiner will come up with formula bearing stamp approval <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> technicians which would prove unacceptable Arab side. Suggest, therefore, that if Weiner’s <pb xml:id="pg_75" n="75" facs="0103"/>trip materializes, Bureau of Reclamation technicians be integrated <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>’s staff and all discussions be held under supervision his staff.</p>
                        <p>3. With Finance Minister Eshkol, Kollek and Sapir all converging on US and Washington next few days,<note n="4" xml:id="d32fn4">See <ref target="#d49">Document 49</ref>.</note> inter-relation water negotiations and other aspects US economic policy toward said program in Israel assumes special importance. Israelis interested obtaining (1) surplus commodities increase stocks, (2) surplus commodities to meet abnormal requirement arising drought conditions here, (3) additional allocation fiscal year 55 economic aid, (4) and largest possible allocation fiscal year 56 aid. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> with four years US economic aid behind it tends to regard this operation as separate one not closely related other US economic objectives in the area. Furthermore, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> has become used to working through a number of channels in Washington.</p>
                        <p>In view of foregoing and taking into account obvious and legitimate <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> interest relation local sales proceeds and counterpart to any US financial participation water development, conclusion reached is that at this juncture it is of utmost importance that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> speak with one voice in all economic and financial discussions with Israelis.</p>

                        <p>740. Tekoah, Chargé Armistice Affairs, Foreign Ministry, has given Embassy following interpretation genesis combat action Gaza Strip last night.</p>
                        <p>1. Israel action was an explosion of pent-up feeling which has been mounting for some time and which reached conclusive point with February 25 murder Israel cyclist 40 kms. inside Israel territory, <pb xml:id="pg_76" n="76" facs="0104"/>plus conclusive evidence Egyptian operations in Israel were being directed by central organization of Egyptian Government.</p>
                        <p>2. These were acts of war and had convinced Israelis that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>, Gohar, Salem, had meant what they said in recent statements that state of war existed between Egypt and Israel. Furthermore Egypt had taken position before Security Council in <hi rend="italic">Bat Galim</hi> case that state of belligerency existed between the two countries.</p>
                        <p>3. Tekoah concluded by saying that Israel had filed a complaint and requested emergency meeting Egyptian-Israel <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> on the grounds action last night had commenced by attack on Israel army unit as per <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> communiqué. (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 737<note n="2" xml:id="d33fn2">Dated March 1; it transmitted reports concerning the military action the previous night, including the text of an <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> communiqué.

                        <head>34. Editorial Note</head>
                        <p>On March 1, the Representative of Egypt informed the President of the United Nations Security Council that on February 28 an Israeli armed force had crossed the armistice demarcation line east of Gaza and attacked an Egyptian military camp. As a result of that attack and of the ambush of Egyptian reinforcements, 37 members of the Egyptian Armed Forces and two civilians had been killed; another 30 members of the armed forces and two civilians had been injured. (U.N. doc. <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>/3365) On March 2, Egypt’s Representative addressed another letter to the President of the Security Council requesting that the Security Council urgently consider this act of “violent and premeditated” Israeli aggression. (U.N. doc. <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>/3367)</p>
                        <p>On March 3, the Representative of Israel, in turn, asked the Security Council to place on its agenda a complaint alleging that Egypt had employed the following techniques to violate the terms of the Egypt-Israel General Armistice Agreement as well as the provisions of various Security Council resolutions: 1) attacks of regular and irregular Egyptian Armed Forces against Israeli Armed Forces; 2) assaults of raiders from Egyptian-controlled territory on lives and property in Israel; 3) failure of the Government of Egypt to adopt and enforce effective measures against such acts of violence; 4) assertion by Egypt of the existence of a state of war and the exercise of active belligerency against Israel, particularly the enforcement of <pb xml:id="pg_77" n="77" facs="0105"/>blockade measures; 5) warlike propaganda and threats against the territorial integrity and political independence of Israel; and 6) refusal of Egypt to seek agreement by negotiations for an effective transition from the present armistice to peace. (U.N. doc. <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>/3368)</p>
                        <p>On March 4, the Security Council, at its 692d meeting, placed the Egyptian and Israeli complaints on its agenda and then adjourned consideration of the matter until it had received the report of Major General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">E.L.M. Burns</persName>, Chief of Staff of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization. (U.N. doc. <gloss target="#t_SPV1">S/PV</gloss>. 692) Meeting again on March 17, the Security Council considered the Chief of Staff’s report. (U.N. doc. <gloss target="#t_SPV1">S/PV</gloss>. 693) In this document, <persName>Burns</persName> informed the Security Council that on March 6, the Egypt–Israel Mixed Armistice Commission had found Israel responsible for the attack at Gaza and had decided that it was a violation of the General Armistice Agreement. Reviewing the situation along the armistice demarcation line, the Chief of Staff said that the number of casualties prior to the Gaza incident reflected the comparative tranquillity which had prevailed in the area during the greater part of the period from November 1954 to February 1955. However, repeated minor incidents had helped to create a state of tension of which one of the main causes, though not the only cause, had undoubtedly been infiltration from Egyptian-controlled territory. In order to decrease the tension along the demarcation line, General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> suggested that the two parties should examine in an informal manner the possibility of agreeing on certain measures: 1) institution of joint patrols along sensitive sections of the demarcation line; 2) negotiation of a local commanders’ agreement; 3) erection of a barbed wire obstacle along certain portions of the demarcation line; and 4) manning of all outposts and patrols by regular Egyptian and Israeli soldiers. In conclusion, the Chief of Staff said that he was of the opinion that, if an agreement were effected along the lines he had suggested, infiltration could be reduced to an occasional nuisance—“a kind of thieving which Israel must probably regard as inevitable”—as long as there were large numbers of poverty-stricken refugees on its border. (U.N. doc. <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>/3373)</p>
                        <p>On March 28, the Representatives of France, the United Kingdom, and the United States submitted to the Security Council two draft resolutions referring respectively to the Gaza incident and to general conditions along the armistice demarcation line. (U.N. doc. <gloss target="#t_SPV1">S/PV</gloss>. 694) On March 29, the Council unanimously adopted the first resolution. (U.N. doc. <gloss target="#t_SPV1">S/PV</gloss>. 695) In this document, the Security Council noted that the Egypt–Israel Mixed Armistice Commission had determined that Israeli authorities had prearranged and planned an attack by Israeli regular army forces against Egyptian army forces in the Gaza Strip on February 28, condemned that attack, and called <pb xml:id="pg_78" n="78" facs="0106"/>upon Israel to take all necessary measures to prevent such actions. (U.N. doc. <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>/3378)</p>
                        <p>On March 30, the Security Council met again and unanimously adopted the second resolution. (U.N. doc. <gloss target="#t_SPV1">S/PV</gloss>. 696) In it, the Council requested the Chief of Staff to continue his consultations with the Governments of Egypt and Israel with a view to introducing practical measures to preserve security in the area, noted the concrete proposals already made by the Chief of Staff, and called upon the two governments to cooperate with the Chief of Staff with regard to his proposals.

                        <p>1261. Shortly after my arrival I received word that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Gamal Abdel Nasser</persName> would like to meet with me secretly at an early date and without regard to waiting my presentation of credentials. I met with him last night for a lengthy discussion in a private home. He was accompanied by Zakaria Mohieddin, Ali Sabri, and Major Touhami.</p>
                        <p>Entire evening devoted to discussion of Turk-Iraq pact and Egyptian line fully reported in messages prior to my arrival. I sensed an intense dislike for Nuri Said as a person that I had not previously taken into account in my attempt to assess present emotional situation. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> himself was more restrained than his colleagues and I got impression he was either tired of talking about problem or realized that <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> were out on a limb from which it would be hard to crawl back. He seemed at times to be aware that Egypt had suffered a defeat and made frequent references to “what is done is done and there is no point in assessing blame. Instead we should all think in terms of the future”.</p>
                        <p>I am unable at this early stage to understand fully the apparent depth of Egyptian feeling. There is no doubt in my mind that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> sincerely feels he was cast aside by US in favor of Nuri of Iraq. I believe he feels that he had presented a definite alternative to the West, although in our logic any plan he has spoken of in the past has been entirely nebulous. I believe he had conceived that his task <pb xml:id="pg_79" n="79" facs="0107"/>was to bring all the Arab States as a bloc towards the West as quickly as Egyptian and Arab public opinion would permit. He conceived this task as being accomplished without any additional formal agreements, relying instead upon present arrangements of the US and British with the Arab world. This bloc would gain strength with our assistance and we would rely upon our trust in them as individuals to assure ourselves that they would be on our side in event of war. The injection of an actual new treaty arrangement of one Arab State with Turkey (i.e. West) he interprets as a great setback to his own plans of bringing into being a genuine pro-Western sentiment among the people.</p>
                        <p>I did not feel in this first meeting in the presence of his advisers that I should speak fully about what the United States can and cannot support as a practical matter in this area. In their present mood they probably would have interpreted my remarks as threats from the US. I did attempt to set the record clear as to what the US had and had not done and as to why, in our view, developments beginning with Pakistan in the northern area were beneficial. In the general line of my exposition I made certain they are under no illusions that we can support a unified Arab Army under present circumstances in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>The meeting was in a friendly atmosphere and ended by Nassar saying he wished another talk “on the future” in 4 or 5 days. I suppose he chose this timing to allow Salah Salem return from the other Arab States prior to further conversations with me.<note n="2" xml:id="d35fn2">Major Salah Salem, Egyptian Minister for National Guidance, arrived in Damascus on February 26 to discuss an Egyptian proposal for a defense pact among those Arab States that opposed alliances with non-Arab powers. On March 2, the Syrian and Egyptian Governments signed a communiqué indicating that they had agreed to refrain from joining the Turkish-Iraqi pact or any other alliances, to establish a joint Arab defense and economic cooperation pact, and to advance these objectives with other Arab States. Salem then visited Jordan and Saudi Arabia seeking support for the accord. On March 6, Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia released the communiqué, which subsequently became known as the <gloss target="#t_ESS1">ESS</gloss> Pact.

(<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 682.87/3–155)</note>) he requested I return to discuss incident last night at Gaza. He reported they had decided take matter immediately to Security Council. He wished me to know as a friend of their contemplated action and requested Washington be informed as we [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] members Security Council.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> stated this first really serious attack this border since armistice agreement and was far more serious than Qibya, as this an attack by armed forces against armed forces. He stated they were in dilemma as on one hand they wished observe rules and did not believe that two wrongs can make one right. On other hand they had to take note their position before world, and particularly at present moment before other Arab States, if they suffered direct attack on their armed forces by Israel and took no action. I counselled moderation to which he agreed but added that he was personally greatly concerned there might be other events.</p>
                        <p>I left copy of message from General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> (Jerusalem Embassy telegram 210<note n="3" xml:id="d36fn3">Telegram 210, March 1, transmitted a message from <persName>Burns</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> assuring him that an investigation of the “deplorable” incident at Gaza was being initiated, informing him that <persName>Burns</persName> had received a report of an attack on the <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> Office by “a riotous crowd” in Gaza, and requesting adequate police protection for U.N. personnel in the future.

                        <p>If fuller investigation verifies facts substantially as believed here now, am at complete loss to understand timing of Israeli action.

                        <p>743. Prime Minister has invited me to “private luncheon” his residence Thursday March 3. I assume this is one of “informal personal talks” which we recently agreed to hold from time to time. There has been no indication of subject to be discussed but from timing I anticipate he will raise subject combat action at Gaza Strip night February 28 (Embassy telegrams 737, 739, 740, 741<note n="2" xml:id="d37fn2">These telegrams, all dated March 1, concerned the military action in the Gaza Strip the previous night. For telegrams 737 and 740, see <ref target="#d33">Document 33</ref> and <ref target="#d37fn2">footnote 2 thereto</ref>. Telegram 739 transmitted the text of a U.N. communiqué of that date and a report on the <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> briefing the night before.

                        <p>1279. For the Secretary. Absence of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> comment re Gaza attack beginning to be noticeable here. Headline this morning <hi rend="italic">Egyptian Gazette</hi> gives British position as follows:</p>
                        <p> “Britain blames Israel: attack premeditated”. Article quotes authoritative British sources in Foreign Office attributable mostly to Nutting. Radio Ankara last night took same line for Turkish Government. British Embassy locally has now found ways of letting their feelings leak to press. Embassy has not commented to press.</p>
                        <p>The above and other factors will cause US position in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> to be reviewed with extraordinary scrutiny.</p>
                        <p>Department will of course be aware that all this bodes ill for operation Alpha and timetable at least will have to be readjusted. Egyptian authorities (with exception of the travelling Salah Salem) are exercising remarkable restraint re attack and its aftermath of refugee rioting but will be some time before they forget their dead and be willing to cooperate with us in finding overall solution.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> prior to my departure<note n="2" xml:id="d39fn2">No record of this conversation has been found in Department of State files.</note> that I would work on Egypt as quickly as possible to advance general relations between Israel and Egypt, the lifting of the blockade, et cetera as I knew this to be in interests my own country as well as Israel. I strongly urged restraint on their part on matters relating to Egypt in order that we might have climate here in which to work. I told him past experience <pb xml:id="pg_83" n="83" facs="0111"/>had led me to fear however that just as we felt we were getting into position to accomplish some gain an act of Israel might make such progress impossible.</p>
                        <p>This Embassy will of course utilize any and every possible opening to accomplish the intent of operation Alpha. Department must of course weigh other aspects in arriving at a course of action on the Gaza incident bearing in mind that a strong stand will greatly assist us here. Needless to say stand taken will also greatly affect our general position in this country and in other neighboring states at this rather critical time.</p>

                        <p>754. Re <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 743, March 3 [1].<note n="2" xml:id="d40fn2">
                                <ref target="#d37">Document 37</ref>.</note> At private luncheon with Prime Minister today I found him more relaxed and calm than at any time since my arrival in Israel. Although last night he had given important foreign policy review before Knesset he showed little tenseness over that experience and more significantly I believe, reflected no serious compunction over Gaza strip event.</p>
                        <p>The sole subject of discussion which produced luncheon invitation appeared to be the Turkey–Iraq pact. In that connection he immediately drew attention to his Knesset speech on subject and responsibilities on US deriving from American policy in Middle East which supports pact. He repeated in general the principal points reported <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 753<note n="3" xml:id="d40fn3">Dated March 2, it reported remarks on the Turco-Iraqi Pact which <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> had made that day in the Knesset. (Department of State, Central Files, 682.87/3–355)</note> but underscored US responsibilities. He said exchange of letters between Iraq and Turkey amending pact<note n="4" xml:id="d40fn4">In letters exchanged at the conclusion of the Turco-Iraqi Pact on February 24, Prime Ministers Nuri al-Said and <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName> pledged close collaboration to repulse aggression against either country and to secure the implementation of all U.N. resolutions pertaining to Palestine and forming the basis of the Arab position vis-à-vis Israel.</note> came <pb xml:id="pg_84" n="84" facs="0112"/>as surprise as he had received definite assurances … there would be no statement in pact referring to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolutions. This was most important objection of Israel to original communiqué on pact.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> admitted quite frankly that terms of exchange of letters not likely to be put into practical effect. He said, “This would mean a bloody war and there is not going to be a bloody war.” Nevertheless, he said, the psychological effect on the Arab world is tremendous. Fact that Turkey endorses anti-Israel policies of Iraq must give tremendous boost to Arab anti-Israel campaign and attitude. His remarks in this field followed closely those reported by Embassy and in fact he implied desire that his main points Knesset speech be transmitted to Department.</p>
                        <p>In reply to my direct inquiry he admitted that pact had brought deterioration in Israel public attitude towards the US although there had been no change in Israeli foreign policy with regard to US as result of pact. It merely meant, he said, that Israel’s isolation and exclusion from Middle East defense system became more highly emphasized in minds of people and government and that latter felt more strongly, “that it recognizes its contractual responsibilities with regard to the defense of the state”.</p>
                        <p>Also in response to my direct inquiry as to whether pact had altered Israel’s foreign relations policy with regard to Arab states and in fact changed government’s recent past policy of moderation, he replied in the negative. In this connection, he introduced, and apparently without premeditation, the Gaza strip incident and told me emphatically that there was no direct connection between the pact signing and the incident. As he put it, the direct reflection of the signing of the pact occurred in the field of public opinion which universally supported the Gaza strip action of Israel’s military forces but was is no way the actuating instrument.</p>
                        <p>I then inquired directly whether timing factor had been involved and if so, why had the Gaza incident taken place at this particular time. He showed amazement that there should be any suggestion of timing of the incident and then engaged in a discussion of the final factors which led up to the high pressure for action under which the <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> had recently been existing. The principal reason being in his terms the fact that, “We have definitely traced recent act of sabotage, espionage and murder to the Egyptian Government Intelligence center at Gaza.” (It is interesting to note that at no time in discussing this subject did he claim that the incident was retaliatory in nature following Egyptian military attacks upon Israel military forces, as has been claimed by <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss>.) He seemed to be placing the <pb xml:id="pg_85" n="85" facs="0113"/>basis of the action on an “explosion which had to come after a build-up of tension and might have occurred at any time.” Throughout this discussion of this dramatic incident he showed one [<hi rend="italic">none?</hi>] of the usual emphatic and over-tense treatment of the subject.</p>
                        <p>I then asked him, also directly, whether the Gaza strip incident was indicative of a change in policy and was in fact the embarkation on a more activist policy, or whether the fact moderation policy which he had been fostering would continue. He told me that there was definitely no change in policy in that respect. He admitted that his efforts to encourage the policy of moderation were not now so effective and it was more difficult for him than in the past to follow this line, but that in principle there had been no change insofar as he was concerned. He described the incident, “as merely an episode—an episode which could occur again but which we hope will not have to recur.” In subsequent discussion he again referred to the Gaza strip incident as an “episode”. He admitted that the incident had been carried somewhat further than originally intended and that there were considerably more casualties than had ever been anticipated. This he ascribed to the high pitch of tension under which the military forces operated.</p>
                        <p>I then spoke of the rather popular impression in certain quarters and what appeared to be rather logical under the circumstances, that is, that the incident was co-incident with the return of <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> to the government, and thus was indicative of the beginning of a less moderate policy as result of his return to the government. This he denied strongly but he did make this somewhat ambiguous statement, “I am not saying that this incident would not have occurred had <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> been outside the government but it could have occurred just as easily. <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> and I are in complete accord.” He then made it a point of suggesting that I might call on <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> at the Ministry of Defense in Tel Aviv especially since <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> had invited me to visit him some weeks ago. I gathered from this suggestion that <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss> might be able to support and explain the governments actions and policies under present conditions as <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> himself had endeavored to explain them to me. Just before I left after lunch he again assured me that the return of <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> to the government has had no effect on the government’s foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>In discussing the detrimental psychological effects of the Turkish-Iraq pact to Israel’s position, the Prime Minister expressed the opinion that [garble] obvious fear of Arab and especially Iraq’s reaction to a Turkish-Israel trade agreement conference, also put Turkey in an unfavorable and weakened position with regard to Iraq. This would greatly encourage Arab action against Israel. …</p>

Re recent Cabinet change and return of <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> to direct participation in government (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 698<note n="2" xml:id="d41fn2">The Embassy in Tel Aviv notified the Department on February 18 that the Israeli Government the preceding evening, February 17, had announced Lavon’s resignation as Minister of Defense, and that he had been replaced by <persName>Ben</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Gurion</persName>, whose appointment “had not been anticipated.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 784A.5/2–1855)</note>), Gaza incident (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 737<note n="3" xml:id="d41fn3">See <ref target="#d33fn2">footnote 2, Document 33</ref>.</note>), and my talk with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> March 3 (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 754<note n="4" xml:id="d41fn4">

                        <p>Embassy’s current appraisal portent of events follows: Consensus is that Gaza incident was the result of a Cabinet decision (probably Sunday, February 28) and attack had full government approval. It was not only carefully planned, timed, and executed, but full consideration was given to resultant impact. Objective use officially determined and force necessary for success of operation carefully chosen.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister’s statement to me that incident had been carried somewhat further than originally intended, seems proof of government planning even though action may have been more “successful” than originally conceived. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>’s statement he and <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> were in complete accord, reinforces belief that action was result of Cabinet decision, despite fact above assertion was included in an ambiguous statement to me suggesting incident could have occurred even if <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> had not been in government.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_87" n="87" facs="0115"/>
                        <p>I understood <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>’s explanation that Gaza action did not represent any change in policy toward Arab States, but was simply an “episode” which could happen again but he hoped would not, designed to convince me that this was not to be a continuing policy. On the other hand, it was obvious that he was leaving matter open, that the Israel Government was maintaining its right to freedom of action and that there was no real assurance that there has not, in fact, been a change in policy.</p>
                        <p>Israel motives, as reconstructed by Embassy, probably included:</p>
                        <p>(1) On international front, attack designed to show <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, US and Great Britain that Israel Government was reaching the end of its rope in following policy of moderation. The signing of Turco-Iraq pact had left it isolated in the area; it felt a sense of frustration because its views were being ignored in the west’s long-term planning; its relative strength vis-à-vis the Arab world was about to suffer; time was running against Israel; there was need to regain initiative and to set stage dramatically in Security Council for reconsideration of <hi rend="italic">Bat Galim</hi> and other matters by broadening of issue. Israel Government, therefore, felt it had to respond to [by] showing world that it would not hesitate to meet “its contractual responsibilities to the defense of the state” as <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> told me.</p>
                        <p>(2) As for Arabs, the action seems to have been designed to show once again Israel’s belief that only way to make Arabs come to terms is through force and that Israel is ready to return to a more openly “get tough” policy if Arabs make the mistake of interpreting past restraint as sign of weakness.</p>
                        <p>(3) On domestic front, <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss> knew that move would be popular in all sectors and quell criticism of government in some; among border settlers it would serve to calm increasing nervousness and assure them of government concern for their safety; it would serve to strengthen the <gloss target="#t_Mapai1">Mapai</gloss> party position which had suffered by recent Cabinet crisis; it was an effective pre-election move.</p>
                        <p>The influence of <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> in the government, his dynamism and his response to public opinion are reflected in the action taken and the foregoing analysis of probable Israel motives. Even <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> has admitted this indirectly by telling me that in principal there has been no change in the moderation policy he had been fostering “insofar as he was concerned”, but that his efforts to encourage it were not now so effective and it was more difficult than in the past for him to follow this line. His statement to me that, “<persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> and I are in complete accord” might well mean that he now agrees with <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>’s tougher attitude.</p>
                        <p>The choice of Egypt as a target may have been based on the following considerations:</p>
                        <p>(a) As the strongest of the Arab states, it was the most suitable target for a devastating raid which would lower the prestige of its army in the eyes of the Arab world.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_88" n="88" facs="0116"/>
                        <p>(b) Following <hi rend="italic">Bat Galim</hi> case, Cairo trial and spy executions there was a popular demand to do something to Egypt.</p>
                        <p>(c) Egypt’s claim that the state of belligerency with Israel still exists offered good excuse to take limited military action to show Egypt what the implication of that claim meant.</p>
                        <p>(d) Egypt’s refusal to comply with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution of freedom of passage through Suez Canal<note n="5" xml:id="d41fn5">Reference is to the U.N. Security Council resolution adopted on September 1, 1951. (U.N. doc. <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>/2322)</note> is the most damaging of all Arab economic boycott measures and the one which Israel wants most to eliminate. If the Arabs applied economic boycott measures without restraint and indulged in cold-war propaganda without curb, Israel would show Egypt and the Arab world that it could use the weapon best suited to its purpose, armed force.</p>

                        <p>760. Two events past week are relevant to any planning looking towards Arab-Israel settlement.</p>
                        <p>Firstly, sands of time ran out on Israel moderation policy before basic concept had been developed to point where it could be discussed with <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> along lines suggested Embdes 413, January 7,<note n="2" xml:id="d42fn2">
                                <ref target="#d4">Document 4</ref>.</note> fourth paragraph, section A. Gaza Strip action, in our judgment, is symptomatic of shift in Israel attitudes and tactics how to deal with Arabs and, possibly, with the US. Problem creation quiet and unemotional atmosphere has shifted from one of urging improvement Israel moderation, to much more formidable one of obtaining reversal new activist trends.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Prime Minister in address to Knesset March 2 set forth thesis that guarantee (by western powers) of Israel’s borders and of defense against aggression is not enough and that help was necessary to “increase our defensive potential”. (Paragraphs 5 and 6, <pb xml:id="pg_89" n="89" facs="0117"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 753<note n="3" xml:id="d42fn3">See <ref target="#d40fn3">footnote 3, Document 40</ref>.</note>.) It has thus become matter of public record, as well as of stated policy, that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> basic “requirements” include maintenance balance military power as between Israel and Arab states, as well as stronger guarantees.</p>
                        <p>It is our view that Israel still regards Egypt as key factor in any rapprochement with Arab states and that Gaza Strip action may have provided for the time being the emotional and political (domestic) outlet apparently needed to compensate for <hi rend="italic">Bat Galim</hi> failure, hanging two Israel spies, accumulation grievances along the border, and Turk-Iraqi pact especially exchange of letters. Whether this action leaves any hope early approach to Egypt and other Arab states resettlement problem in question we will leave to US mission Cairo and other missions Arab capitals. It is our judgment, however, that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> will not be prepared to give serious consideration to specific proposals, such as resettlement of refugees, compensation for them or border adjustments, unless US is prepared simultaneously to discuss Israel security requirements as per preceding paragraph.</p>

                        <p>Turning to a discussion of his negotiation with the Arab nations and the Israelis concerning the project for development of water resources in the Jordan area, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> reported that before his trip he had thought he could obtain Israeli agreement but would have great difficulty with the Arab states (since he had revised his plan to give 40% of the water to Israel). After considerable difficulties, <pb xml:id="pg_90" n="90" facs="0118"/>he had brought the Arabs to a point where they were ready to agree; however Israel then insisted upon 50% of the water, and although he got them to lower this figure, he could not get them below a figure of approximately 43%. He discussed the intensity of feeling on both sides, and discussed also possibilities for obtaining Israeli agreement.</p>

                        <p>2. Israeli raid on Gaza has, of course, greatly increased difficulties of launching Alpha. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> and I feel, however, that US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> should continue to make the acceptance and implementation of what we believe could be an equitable settlement one of the guiding considerations in our policy toward the area during coming months.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_91" n="91" facs="0119"/>
                        <p>3. With respect to Israel, we suggest that US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> take position that because of overriding need which must concern all of us, including Israel, we intend to continue with our policy of strengthening the Middle East against outside aggression by working out agreements based on the northern tier approach. Because of the state of Arab feeling toward Israel, not improved since the Gaza raid, it is not possible to consider associating Israel with these area defense arrangements at this time. First essential is to get these arrangements into shape. When this has been achieved and when state of Israel’s relations with the Arab States permits, we would be prepared to consider discussions with Israel about its role in area defense. Concerning Israel’s need for intra-area security we should say that, as <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss> has already been informed, this problem is receiving our active consideration; that we are not disposed to assume obligations with respect to the security of a border which is continuously marked by border raids and military actions and that we therefore are giving consideration to steps that could be taken to produce a genuine reduction of tension as a prelude to security undertakings. The <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss>’s Gaza raid has obviously set back for sometime the possibility of success in this effort but we intend to press forward with it, and, in view of Israel’s need for security guarantees, we entertain the hope we may receive more cooperation in the future than we have in the past in our efforts to reduce tensions. (With respect to economic aid and the supplying of military equipment, e.g. British tanks, French planes, and US small arms, we might tighten up or delay somewhat but gauge our restrictions by the likelihood of their promoting <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss> cooperations.)</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> and I continue to believe that Egyptian Government is the one through which efforts to obtain Arab agreement should be initiated, difficult as this may appear at the moment. There appear to us to be four possibilities: (a) Give our representatives in Cairo discretion to approach <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> at an early date (but bearing in mind state of <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>–Iraq treaty negotiations<note n="9" xml:id="d44fn9">The United Kingdom and Iraq were engaged in negotiations which led, on April 4, to the signing of an agreement terminating the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930 and securing British adherence to the Iraqi-Turkish pact of February 24. Two days thereafter, on April 6, the new Anglo-Iraqi agreement came into effect.</note>). As point of departure, they could make use of Gaza raid as symptomatic of situation which weakens Egypt’s position at home and abroad; and then make points outlined in brief prepared for <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s talk with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>; or (b) wait two or three months for present tensions to relax and then make approach to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>; or (c) if at end of four or five months approach to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> has not proved feasible, explore possibilities of approach to Jordan; or (d) if none of above prove possible <pb xml:id="pg_92" n="92" facs="0120"/>publicize some such plan as Alpha as a solution advocated by western powers. A variant would be to try to arrange Pakistan-Turkish sponsorship ostensible authorship.</p>
                        <p>5. In Security Council consideration of Gaza incident, it will, of course, be difficult for any resolution which may be passed to avoid urging parties to move toward settlement. Nevertheless it must be borne in mind that in view of Arab sentiments toward <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> role in Palestine they would be predisposed to reject Alpha proposals at outset if they believed US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> effort at over-all settlement stemmed from Israel use of force at Gaza and from resulting <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> recommendation. From this point of view, it would be preferable to have any reference to settlement go no further than those in previous resolutions.</p>

                        <p>510. For Ambassador. You should call upon <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> soonest and give him following oral message from Secretary:</p>
                        <p> “1. I had been led believe that present Government of Israel was sincerely interested in the reduction of tension in the area and to that end was pursuing a policy of restraint and moderation. The recent incident in Gaza raises questions as to the validity of this assumption.</p>
                        <p>2. The <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has consistently opposed reprisal raids. The facts have shown that such raids dangerously heighten existing tensions. The very insecurity of which Israel complains is aggravated by such a policy.</p>
                        <p>3. You will recall that since August 1954, at your Ambassador’s urgent request, I have been personally engaged in the study of possible measures looking toward the alleviation of the feelings of apprehension and isolation which, according to the Israel Government, <pb xml:id="pg_93" n="93" facs="0121"/>were besetting the people of Israel.<note n="2" xml:id="d45fn2">For summaries of the Secretary’s conversations of August 4 and 7, 1954, with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>, see telegrams 61 and 72 to Tel Aviv, August 4 and 7, in <ref target="frus1952-54v09p1">

IX, Part 1</ref>, pp. 1600 and 1604, respectively.</note> I advised you on February 14<note n="3" xml:id="d45fn3">See <ref target="#d22">Document 22</ref>.</note> that good progress had been made in this study and pointed out the necessity for continued calm in the area and the helpful effect of Israel’s policy of moderation. The Gaza incident, which has re-inflamed hatreds, will of necessity require reorientation of this study to take account of existing facts.</p>
                        <p>4. Our common interest requires that there be a reduction of tension in the Near East as a means of strengthening the area for defense against the Communist threat. It is the firm intention of the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to continue to work toward these objectives and our policy toward Israel will be formulated in the light of this intention. I bespeak Israel’s full cooperation in this endeavor. I have not been reassured by the characterization of the Gaza incident as ‘merely an episode’ which presumably might recur.”<note n="4" xml:id="d45fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_LEB1">Lawson</persName> informed the Department on March 13 that he had delivered the Secretary’s message on March 12 to <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>, who reiterated his previous statements that the Gaza incident represented no change in Israel’s basic policy; that Israel would continue to pursue a policy of moderation; but that Israel had used forceful methods in this instance to protect its national security interests.

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> recalled that when the Secretary of State received Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> on March 9<note n="2" xml:id="d47fn2">See <hi rend="italic">supra.</hi>
                            </note> he had been favourably impressed by the broad outlines of the Alpha settlement and had thought that an early approach to Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> might be desirable. It would be necessary to seek the views of the United Kingdom and United States Ambassadors<note n="3" xml:id="d47fn3">Sir Ralph Clarmont Skrine Stevenson and <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Henry A.

The Foreign Office were ready to send a suitable telegram to Sir Ralph <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Stevenson</persName> at the appropriate time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> said that immediately on his return to Washington he would report personally to Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> and would inform him of Sir <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony Eden</persName>’s views. He would recommend to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> that simultaneous telegrams be sent from Washington and London to the two representatives at Cairo asking for their joint views and emphasising the need to avoid disturbing the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty negotiations.<note n="4" xml:id="d47fn4">See <ref target="#d52">Document 52</ref>.</note>

                            <hi rend="italic">It was agreed</hi> that meanwhile, as soon as the agreed documents resulting from the present meetings were ready, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> would write to the United States Ambassador in Cairo<note n="5" xml:id="d47fn5">A letter of March 10 from <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> is in Department of State, <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> Files: Lot 59 D 518, London Talks, Feb.–March 1955: (1) Memo of Conv of 3/9 with <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>; (2) FHR’s letr of 3/10 to <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName>.</note> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> to Her Majesty’s Ambassador, in order to inform them fully and let them know that their views might shortly be required on the question of timing.</p>
                        <p>As regards informing other representatives of the two Governments, it was pointed out that the first object would be to give them <pb xml:id="pg_96" n="96" facs="0124"/>warning that approaches were being made which might intimately affect their relations with the local Governments (e.g. at Tel Aviv, Amman and Bagdad); a secondary object would be to obtain their personal views on the substance of the Alpha settlement. It was essential, however, that no hint of the operation should be given before Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> was sounded.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> said that Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Amman<note n="6" xml:id="d47fn6">Charles Beresford Duke.</note> knew the broad outline of the settlement, although he had no papers. It would be desirable for the Head of the British Middle East Office at Nicosia<note n="7" xml:id="d47fn7">Sir John Cecil Sterndale Bennett.</note> and Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad<note n="8" xml:id="d47fn8">Sir Michael Wright.</note> to be informed also at an early date.</p>

                        <p>It was noted that the State Department would inform the Foreign Office of the result of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>’s report to Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> and about any attempt it desired the United Kingdom to make, at a high level, to modify the attitude of the Israel Government towards the Jordan waters scheme.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">D. Provisional Tactics When Alpha Is Launched</p>
                        <p>Assuming that Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> reacted favourably and was inclined to adopt the Alpha recommendations, <hi rend="italic">it was agreed</hi> that the preparatory warning approach to the Governments of Jordan and Iraq should be made by the United Kingdom representatives at Amman and Bagdad after full consultation with their American colleagues.

                            <hi rend="italic">It was agreed</hi> that, in order to lend weight to the approach to the Israel Government, the two Secretaries of State might send written messages to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>, setting out the Alpha proposals in broad detail and commending to him the arguments which the two Ambassadors at Tel Aviv would use. It would probably be desirable for the two Ambassadors to travel unobtrusively to Cyprus for briefing, possibly by Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName>, and they could then be given the signed letters from their Secretaries of State.

It would be desirable for subsequent detailed discussions of Alpha to be held with the Israelis in London. The Egyptian Government might agree also to similar detailed discussions which could eventually be transferred to London. The object would be in due course to get the two parties into the same room.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. General</p>
                        <p>A. While initiating the project at present is complicated by the still unfinished <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> negotiations, the ferment in the Arab world created by the Turk-Iraq Pact which may be increased by <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> adherence to the Pact and by the new Israel attack on Gaza, it is probable that the current year is as favorable a time as is likely to arise in the foreseeable future for an attempt to achieve a settlement in the dispute between the Arab states and Israel.</p>
                        <p>B. An attempt at an overall settlement will allow us to present a balanced set of proposals which might permit us to dispose of some problems such as boundaries which are resistant to solution in isolation. Indeed, Egyptian Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> recently stated to Sir <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony Eden</persName> that no solution was to be found in partial settlements.</p>
                        <p>C. The method which offers the best chance of success and involves the least risk is that the United States and United Kingdom Governments should work out the general terms of a reasonable settlement and then by separate discussion with the parties concerned, and if possible through direct talks between them, attempt to get them to agree to the settlement or to an agreed variation of it.</p>
                        <p>D. Success of the <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> Mission would be most helpful in creating a favorable atmosphere for Alpha, but the Alpha inducements, particularly the security guarantee, should not be extended to secure acceptance of the Unified Development Plan alone.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_99" n="99" facs="0127"/>
                        <p>E. The present proposals have been worked out on an ad referendum basis.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Method and Timing of the Approach to the Parties</p>
                        <p>A. The first approach should be made to Egypt, difficult as this may appear at the moment. …</p>
                        <p>B. Two alternatives with respect to the precise timing of the approach to Egypt are foreseen.</p>
                        <p>1. In the immediate future (but bearing in mind the state of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>–Iraq treaty negotiations). The argument in favor of this approach is that Egypt has now been aroused by the Gaza incident, is confronted in an acute form with the problem of Israel, and might be willing to make arrangements which would prevent a repetition and further damage to her prestige.</p>
                        <p>2. Postponement of the approach for two or three months in the belief that the Gaza raid has so aroused Egyptian hostility to Israel that she would be unwilling to contemplate a settlement with Israel at present. In addition she would not wish to open herself to accusations from Iraq during her present quarrel with that country of following a pro-Israel policy.</p>
                        <p>The advice of the two ambassadors in Cairo should be sought regarding which course is preferable.</p>
                        <p>C. Other possibilities are:</p>
                        <p>1. If at the end of four or five months the approach to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> has not proved feasible, explore the possibilities of an attempt through Jordan.</p>
                        <p>2. If none of the above prove possible, publicize some such plan as Alpha as a solution advocated by the Western powers. A variant would be to try to arrange Pakistan-Turkish sponsorship and ostensible authorship.</p>
                        <p>D. In either event consideration should be given to parallel letters to <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> from Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> and Sir <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony Eden</persName> covering the following points:</p>
                        <p>1. Because of the overriding need which must concern all of us, including Israel, we intend to continue with our policy of strengthening the Middle East against outside aggression by working out agreements based on the northern tier approach. Because of the state of Arab feeling toward Israel, not improved since the Gaza raid, it is not possible to consider associating Israel with these area defense arrangements at this time. The first essential is to get these arrangements into shape. When this has been achieved and when the state of Israel’s relations with the Arab states permits, we would be prepared to consider discussions with Israel about its role in area defense.</p>
                        <p>2. Israel’s security problem is receiving our active consideration, but we are not disposed to assume obligations with respect to the security of a border which is continuously marked by border raids and military actions. Therefore, we are giving consideration to steps <pb xml:id="pg_100" n="100" facs="0128"/>that could be taken to produce a genuine reduction of tension as a prelude to a security undertaking.</p>
                        <p>3. The Israel Government’s Gaza raid has obviously set back for some time the possibility of success in this effort.</p>
                        <p>4. But we intend to press forward with it and, in view of Israel’s need for a security guarantee, we entertain the hope that we may receive more cooperation in the future than we have in the past in our efforts to reduce tensions.</p>
                        <p>E. In view of the fact that Sir <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony Eden</persName> has already mentioned the problem to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> should broach the matter next probably along the lines of the brief prepared for Sir <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony</persName>. In determining how far he should go Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> would be governed by consultations with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Stevenson</persName> and by <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s receptivity.</p>
                        <p>F. In revealing the proposal to the parties we would not be too specific at first and would not present the plan as a whole. The purpose would be to develop the proposal gradually so that the solution should appear to emerge from the discussions with the parties rather than to have been worked out fully by the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and US Governments in advance.</p>
                        <p>G. We should inform the French and Turks in very general terms of our intentions to make some approaches as soon as we are satisfied from contacts with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> that progress can be made and thenceforth we should keep both governments informed in a very general way of our discussions with the parties.</p>
                        <p>H. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would outline our intentions to Jordan after headway had been made with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> and immediately before the approach to Israel. This is necessary because of the special treaty relationship between the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Jordan.<note n="2" xml:id="d48fn2">Reference is to the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty of Alliance, signed at Amman on March 15, 1948. For text, see 77 <gloss target="#t_UNTS1">UNTS</gloss> 77.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>I. We should inform Iraq of our intentions at about the time we inform Israel in order to ensure that she did not make it difficult for Egypt to cooperate by accusing her of following a pro-Israel policy. We should seek an assurance that Iraq would accept whatever Israel’s Arab neighbors accept and if necessary we should relay that assurance to Egypt. The Iraqis themselves need not be involved in the negotiations or the settlement.</p>
                        <p>J. After steps G, H and I above, which we contemplate should not take more than two or three days, the plan would be discussed with Israel. We would indicate that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> was prepared to consider a settlement and that from discussions with him we had reached the conclusion that we were justified in putting forward as a basis for discussion a set of ideas which we consider offers prospect of progress toward a settlement. We would state that if Israel is ready <pb xml:id="pg_101" n="101" facs="0129"/>to pursue discussions on this basis, we were prepared to continue our efforts. If it should be necessary, we would make clear to Israel the effects of a refusal on her part to cooperate, mentioning particularly that under such circumstances we would be unable to extend the security guarantee she has requested, and that she would have to bear the onus for failure of our efforts to progress toward peace.</p>
                        <p>K. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> should continue his efforts to secure Israel acceptance of a Unified Development Plan but Alpha need not be delayed until after a possible trip by <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> to the area in April or May. If Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> is unsuccessful the Unified Development Plan should be incorporated as one of the elements in Alpha.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. Inducements and Psychological Factors</p>
                        <p>A. The terms of the settlement itself will contain inducements to the parties, but these will probably be insufficient to overcome the Arabs’ resistance to any settlement and Israel’s reluctance to make the concessions required of her. Outside inducements will therefore be necessary: e.g., military and economic aid, and security guarantees.</p>
                        <p>B. Since no Arab state is likely to participate in a settlement unless it knows that Egypt is sympathetic, Egyptian cooperation is of first importance in any attempt at a settlement. We shall therefore need to offer inducements to Egypt. However, we could not acquiesce in <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s attitude towards the Turk-Iraq Pact as an inducement to him to move towards a Palestine settlement. The following are the main possibilities:</p>
                        <p>1. The prestige implied in the fact that we have chosen to consult <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> first.</p>
                        <p>2. The suggestion that if Egypt will take the lead in solving this problem it will eventually strengthen her position as an influential power and enable her to obtain the advantages of cooperation with the West. The solution of the Palestine problem will eliminate a major impediment to such cooperation.</p>
                        <p>3. Military assistance, the extent and conditions of which will in any case depend on the state of the relations between Israel and the Arab states.</p>
                        <p>4. Prospects of support for Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s domestic plans for the future of Egypt.</p>
                        <p>5. Specific offers of economic aid, for example, on the High Aswan Dam project.</p>
                        <p>6. The offer of a security guarantee.</p>
                        <p>7. Elimination of the possibility of constant clashes with Israel.</p>
                        <p>C. Inducements to Israel include:</p>
                        <p>1. A security guarantee.</p>
                        <p>2. Elimination of factors creating tension between Israel and her neighbors.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_102" n="102" facs="0130"/>
                        <p>3. Removal of Suez Canal restrictions. Termination of the secondary boycott.</p>
                        <p>4. Continued US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> interest in Israel’s economic future.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">IV. Elements of a Settlement</p>
                        <p>A. Territorial Adjustments</p>
                        <p>1. Israel must make concessions. The Arabs will not reconcile themselves to reaching a settlement with an Israel with the present boundaries. However, we cannot expect large transfers of territory. The changes proposed should be such that in presenting them to Israel they can be made to appear as “frontier adjustments” which <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> has stated Israel would be prepared to make. From the Arab point of view they will reunite village lands. They will be designed to produce a frontier which could last with a minimum of friction.</p>
                        <p>2. No change is proposed in the border between Israel and Lebanon; it should continue to follow the old international boundary.</p>
                        <p>4. The Jordan frontier should be adjusted so that Arab villages on the Jordan side recover a portion of their former lands from which they are separated by the demarcation line, certain Arab villages lying at the border are placed within Jordan and a more rational border is established. All modifications would be in favor of Jordan with the exception of the Latrun salient which would be relinquished to Israel to permit restoration of the old Tel Aviv-Jerusalem Road and eliminate an awkward salient. Israel would give up small areas, generally not containing Israel settlements, along most of the present line…. The changes suggested would not affect Israel adversely either militarily or economically and the total area would amount to about_square miles ….</p>
                        <p>7. Israel would cede to Egypt and Jordan two small triangles of territory in the southern Negev based respectively on the Egyptian–Israel, and Jordan–Israel frontiers with their apexes meeting on the present or proposed Israel road to Elath. The purpose would be to permit a land connection between Egypt and the rest of the Arab world. International supervision would be provided at the intersection.</p>
                        <p>8. Appendix 1 describes the changes in detail.<note n="3" xml:id="d48fn3">See <ref target="#d47fn12">footnote 12</ref>

                        <pb xml:id="pg_103" n="103" facs="0131"/>
                        <p>B. Refugees</p>
                        <p>1. To prove acceptable to the Arabs the proposals must contain provision for repatriation of Arab refugees and the payment of compensation. In practice only a small number of refugees probably wish to return to Israel and in general it would not be desirable to increase too greatly Israel’s Arab population.</p>
                        <p>2. Israel would be asked to repatriate as Israel citizens up to 75,000 refugees over a five-year period. This could be done through a non-renewable quota system providing for the admittance of 15,000 yearly with priority given to refugees from the Gaza strip. Persons readmitted would be settled by the Government of Israel in the same manner as new Jewish immigrants and <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> would provide financial assistance to this end.</p>
                        <p>3. The eventual resettlement of all refugees depends upon the general economic development of the area as well as upon specific <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> projects and freedom of the refugees to move in order to take employment. In the long run the best prospects are provided by the economic development program under way in Iraq. A very rough forecast of resettlement possibilities is as follows: Syria, 80,000; Lebanon, 40,000; Iraq, 60,000 (initial increment); Jordan Valley including the Unified Development Plan, 200,000; Sinai Project, 70,000; Israel, 50,000 (it is very doubtful that the full 75,000 would want to return); total, 500,000.</p>
                        <p>4. Compensation.</p>
                        <p>a. Both the Arabs and Israel will advance large claims and counter-claims which will prove almost impossible to evaluate. These will include: on the part of Israel claims for abandoned Jewish property in Jordan, war damage and Jewish property sequestered in the Arab states; on the part of the Arabs, movable property, tenant’s rights and loss of use and rents on property. The most practical approach is first to negotiate with Israel a fixed figure which will represent the net amount to be paid by Israel for compensation after all claims and counterclaims have been taken into account. The suggested figure is £100,000,000. This is the <gloss target="#t_PCC1">PCC</gloss> estimate, which is understood to be conservative, of Arab immovable property abandoned in areas of Palestine now held by Israel.</p>
                        <p>b. It is important for psychological reasons with respect to the Arabs as well as to minimize the financial burden on the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> that Israel contributions to compensation be as large as possible but it [is] recognized that unassisted she is unable to finance such a large sum. In view of the time which will be consumed in determining individual claims, the difficulty of providing funds and the low economic absorbative [absorptive?] capacity of the area payments should be made over a ten-year period. Of the total Israel and world Jewry combined should pay 30 per cent and 70 per cent would have to be provided by the world community, primarily the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, in the form of loans to Israel. Israel should accept responsibility for repayment and servicing of the loans.</p>
                        <p>c. The funds available for compensation should be distributed through a quasi-judicial process to persons who are able to <pb xml:id="pg_104" n="104" facs="0132"/>establish title to real property. Persons otherwise entitled to compensation would be paid even though repatriated to Israel. To avoid double payment any claims would be reduced by the value of real property or equipment provided to a resettled refugee by <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss>. Large claimants, estimated at 11,000, should be paid on a deferred basis to reduce dangers of inflation and provisions should be made to encourage maximum investment of the funds in the area. All refugees should receive some payment. This could perhaps be done by dividing the value of common land, to which title is difficult to determine, among refugees with no claims and those with very small claims.</p>
                        <p>d. A special <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> agency should be established to administer the program: <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> would make the actual payments.</p>
                        <p>e. The value of Arab lands returned by Israel to Jordan in the frontier adjustments would be deducted from the compensation total, while the value of land acquired by Israel at Latrun would be added. Payments for property in the demilitarized zones on the Syrian border would be handled separately.</p>
                        <p>f. Appendix 2 describes in detail the suggested compensation, repatriation and resettlement programs.<note n="4" xml:id="d48fn4">See <ref target="#d47fn12">footnote 12</ref>

                        </p>
                        <p>C. Jerusalem</p>
                        <p>1. The US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would inform the parties that they were prepared to sponsor a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution on the lines of the Swedish proposal of 1950 on the supervision of and access to the Holy Places ….</p>
                        <p>2. Israel would be informed that following agreement upon a settlement and pending the adoption of such a resolution, the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Ambassadors would start to call at the Israeli Foreign Office in Jerusalem, ….</p>
                        <p>3. Government House would become the seat of the international authority charged with the supervision of the Holy Places and possibly other <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> agencies.</p>
                        <p>4. Jerusalem would be demilitarized along the lines of plans which are being discussed by the Consuls-General of Britain, France and the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>5. If France is willing to support the present plan she should be invited to participate in the negotiations on Jerusalem and to use her influence with the Vatican. If she does not favor the plan she should not be included and other means of influencing the Vatican and the Catholic States should be sought.</p>
                        <p>6. No approach should be made to the Vatican at this time.</p>
                        <p>D. Communications Arrangements</p>
                        <p>1. Israel to offer Jordan free port facilities at Haifa and free access to the port.</p>
                        <p>2. Mutual overflight rights for civil aircraft of the parties.</p>
                        <p>3. Israel to permit the restoration or construction of telecommunications facilities between the Arab states across her territory.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_105" n="105" facs="0133"/>
                        <p>4. Some mixed or <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> authority to be established to hear complaints on the infringements of communications rights.</p>
                        <p>E. The Boycott</p>
                        <p>1. The Arab states would:</p>
                        <p>a. remove restrictions on transiting the Suez Canal, including those on Israel vessels,</p>
                        <p>b. cease the “secondary boycott”, defined as attempts to prevent trade between Israel and non-Arab countries, including termination of all pressure on non-Arab firms trading with Israel,</p>
                        <p>c. abolish the Arab League Boycott offices; repeal all legislation based on the existence of a state of belligerency.</p>
                        <p>2. The Arab states would not be pressed to engage in direct trade with Israel.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">V. The Form of a Settlement and Guarantees to the Parties</p>
                        <p>A. While treaties of peace between Israel and the Arab states remain our ultimate objective, the state of Arab public opinion does not make it feasible to insist upon such treaties as an immediate objective. We should endeavor to bring about to the maximum extent possible permanent arrangements which would provide the substance, if not the form, of peace. It should be our objective to obtain the termination of the state of belligerency between the countries both to remove the basis for the Suez Canal blockade and the secondary boycott and to justify to the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> public and law makers the security guarantees and substantial financial contributions required. The termination of belligerency could be provided for by inserting in the preamble of the revised Armistice Agreements the phrase “recognizing that the state of war (or belligerency) between them has come to an end, the parties, etc.”</p>
                        <p>B. Instrument of Settlement</p>
                        <p>1. Permanent frontiers should be established by re-negotiation of the Armistice Agreements. These contain provisions for modification by consent of both parties. The <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> should continue to supervise the boundaries as long as necessary. The new frontiers should be noted in any guarantee decided upon.</p>
                        <p>2. The whole settlement need not be covered in a single document. Different means should be used for the different components, possibly as follows:</p>
                        <p>a. <hi rend="italic">Territorial.</hi> The territorial settlement to be embodied in a revision of the Armistice Agreements (see above).</p>
                        <p>b. <hi rend="italic">Jordan Waters.</hi> A separate agreement would be made between the parties on the development of the Jordan Valley and the operation of the unified scheme.</p>
                        <p>c. <hi rend="italic">Refugees.</hi> A <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution should be passed incorporating the provisions for repatriation, resettlement and compensation <pb xml:id="pg_106" n="106" facs="0134"/>previously agreed to and calling upon Israel and the Arab states to comply. The resolution could also provide for the creation of a new agency to handle the mechanics of compensation. Israel and the several Arab states could indicate their intentions to comply by separate letters to the Secretary General.</p>
                        <p>d. <hi rend="italic">Jerusalem.</hi> Arrangements for Jerusalem and the Holy Places would be the subject of a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution.</p>
                        <p>e. <hi rend="italic">Communications.</hi> Free ports and transit arrangements would be the subject of direct agreements between the parties.</p>
                        <p>f. <hi rend="italic">The Blockade.</hi> The Arab states would dissolve the Arab League Boycott office and repeal domestic legislation based on or presupposing a state of war. This would remove the legal basis for restriction on Suez Canal traffic and the boycott. We would if necessary make it clear to the Arabs that we were not insisting on removal of prohibitions on direct trade with Israel provided these were not based on legislation claiming the existence of a state of belligerency.</p>
                        <p>C. Security Guarantees</p>
                        <p>1. It will be necessary for the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and possibly Turkey and France to guarantee the frontiers to be established between Israel and the Arab states against alteration by force. This could be accomplished by separate treaties between the guaranteeing powers and Israel and the Arab states. The operative clause might read: “The parties to the present treaty will jointly or separately take appropriate measures for the maintenance or restoration of the agreed boundaries.”</p>
                        <p>2. The Guarantee would not cover other aspects of the settlement; nor would it come into operation in the case of frontier incidents not involving the occupation of territory. Such incidents, however, if they constituted “any threat of an attack by armed force” would bring into operation the commitment of the parties to consult together. The guarantors might inform the Arab states and Israel that they are prepared to discuss the means of implementing the guarantee.</p>
                        <p>3. The participating powers might offer one treaty to Israel embodying the guarantee and a separate similar treaty to each Arab state. Should the Arab states be unwilling to sign treaties with the Western Powers, a unilateral guarantee by the Western Powers might be extended to them and the offer of a treaty left open.</p>
                        <p>4. In the proposed Treaty with Jordan a special article might be included stating that rights and obligations under the Anglo-Jordan Treaty are not affected.</p>
                        <p>5. Draft treaties are attached.<note n="5" xml:id="d48fn5">See <ref target="#d47fn12">footnote 12</ref>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">VI. The Roles of France, Turkey, and the United Nations</p>
                        <p>1. France should not be included in the planning or negotiations but should be informed of the proposals prior to the approach to Israel. In order to avoid offending her she would not be informed of the project as a complete plan worked out by the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, but <pb xml:id="pg_107" n="107" facs="0135"/>its various components would be revealed gradually to her as they are unfolded to the parties. If France were prepared to cooperate, she might be included in the negotiations on Jerusalem. (See IV.C.) The participation of France as a guaranteeing power would be considered in the light of the reaction of the guaranteed states and the general situation at the time.</p>
                        <p>2. Turkey would not be included in the planning or in the negotiations but would be informed at the same time and in the same manner as France. The question of Turkey’s participation in the guarantee would be considered in the light of the reaction of the guaranteed states and the general situation at the time.</p>
                        <p>3. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would be involved in the machinery of a settlement, for example, in supervision of the frontier, and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolutions would probably be required, for example, in connection with Jerusalem and the refugees. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> should not be informed of the project until negotiations with the parties are well advanced.</p>
                        <p>4. The possibility should be borne in mind that Pakistan might play a useful part in including the Arab states to accept the proposals.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">VII. Cost of the Operation</p>
                        <p>A. As inducements to a resolution of the Arab-Israel problem, it is anticipated that it would be necessary for the United States and the United Kingdom to provide assistance in addition to present and already projected commitments (development assistance, <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> relief and rehabilitation, and the unified development of the Jordan Valley). Such new assistance might include:</p>
                        <p>1. US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> participation in the financing of compensation by Israel to the Palestine refugees.</p>
                        <p>2. Economic inducements such as substantial grant aid for the High Aswan Dam, etc.</p>
                        <p>3. Military aid to the cooperating countries.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> reported on the nature of the negotiations undertaken in January and February in Israel and the Arab States which involved three principal elements: storage sites, neutral control of the waters, and the division of the waters in quantitative allotments to the various states.</p>
                        <p>On his first visit to Israel, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> thought that the Israelis might accept 40 percent of the River as their allocation but instead he found that the Israelis wished at least 50 percent. He had left Israel for Egypt to meet with the Arab Committee where the conversations were important but had led to no understanding. In Jordan the King had been extremely helpful, and it was probably his influence which had led the Jordanians to take a reasonable and constructive view in later negotiations which culminated in a tentative agreement with the Arab States in Beirut. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> kept the Beirut understanding tentative as far as he was concerned to keep open his negotiating position in Israel. On his return to Israel, there was a slight modification in the Israeli position. To meet the Jordanian requirements of 131 mcms of Jordan water, the Israelis agreed to find 50, and another 50 but with conditions attached which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> considered not negotiable on the Arab side. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> was prepared to try to persuade the Arabs to reduce their <pb xml:id="pg_110" n="110" facs="0138"/>claims on the Jordan itself from 131 to 100 million cubic meters, however.</p>
                        <p>Since his return to the United States Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> had met with Mr. Eshkol, the Israeli Finance Minister in charge of the negotiations, and there were indications that Israel might remove the conditions which they wished to attach to the second 50 mcms of Jordan water.<note n="2" xml:id="d50fn2">
                                <hi rend="italic">See supra.</hi>
                            </note> Mr. Eshkol had undertaken to seek Cabinet approval of such a course. Still unsettled in Israel were technical questions underlying the use of Lake Tiberias as a storage reservoir for the Arabs, but these problems were not insuperable.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> then referred to a conversation held in the morning with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d50fn3">The memorandum of this conversation is not printed. (Department of State, <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss>/IAI Files: Lot 70 D 254, Framework of the Fourth Mission—No. 18 (Jan. 1955–April 21, 1955)</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> reported a conversation he had held on March 14 with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName>.<note n="4" xml:id="d50fn4">The memorandum of conversation is not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> Central Files, 684A.86/ 3–1456)</note> According to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> had threatened to withhold aid from Israel unless the Israelis came to terms with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> emphasized that it was not his role to consider the Department of State’s policy in such matters, but that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> had advised him that such a course would be harmful to the Jordan Valley negotiations and that he had therefore not reported his conversation on this matter to his Government. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> continued to point out that he felt that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> had rendered a very helpful service in indicating to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> the extent of support within the United States Government for the Jordan Valley program.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> then outlined the course of his conversation of March 14 with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> had called to discuss the Gaza incident and to seek our support in including on the agenda of the Security Council a list of Arab incursions, as well as the Israeli attack on Gaza. The conversation then turned to the Jordan Valley program, which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> indicated had his full support. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> then raised questions regarding the remaining $10 million of aid which Israel is expecting from <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> in 1955, the problem of surplus foods to Israel to be made available under Public Law 480,<note n="5" xml:id="d50fn5">Reference is to the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954, which became Public Law 480 on July 10. For text, see 68 Stat. (pt. 1) 454.</note> and the level of aid to Israel in 1956. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> stated that he had advised Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> that agreement on the Jordan River problem would furnish a useful basis for aid, as we could point out to the Congress that our aid was providing a permanent benefit to Israel and her neighbors. He had informed <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> that we had taken a similar line in dealing <pb xml:id="pg_111" n="111" facs="0139"/>with aid to Iran during Mossadegh’s regime.<note n="6" xml:id="d50fn6">For documentation concerning U.S. policy with respect to the question of extending military and economic assistance to Iran during Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MM2">Mohammed Mossadeq</persName>’s administration, see <ref target="frus1952-54v10">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1952–1954, volume X</ref>.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> thought that <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> had emphasized the negative point of view in interpreting his conversation; whereas Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName>’s remarks were intended to be positive.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> then stated that whatever course of action might be taken on aid should not be attached to the present Jordan Valley negotiations. This he felt would be a great mistake at this time, as he hoped for a favorable decision by Israel in two or three weeks. Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> pointed out there was no great urgency in reaching a decision on 1955 aid funds; this could be taken any time prior to June 30. The aid could be allotted now, or later, or the amount could be split for release at different times. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> referred to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>’s opinion, that withholding 1955 aid would have a detrimental effect on his Government’s attitude on the Jordan Valley plan. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> stated once again that it would be unfortunate to use the status of the Jordan Valley negotiations as a reason for our failure to allot aid. Mr. Gardiner pointed out that in the case of surplus foods Israel intended to use the proceeds for irrigation projects, and a decision in this case was less urgent as the foods in question are intended to build up Israel’s stockpiles.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary inquired as to the cost of the Jordan Valley project. Mr. Gardiner indicated that the estimates for the elements in Jordan itself were $90 million, and that we could hopefully look for contributions from other countries to diminish the U.S. burden as it was intended to carry out the project in Jordan through the <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss>. Estimates in Israel total $45 million to be spread over three or four years. The additional $60 million which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> had been authorized to discuss, intended for Lebanon, Syria and Jordan, had been used by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> only in part. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> then related his negotiations with President <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Chamoun</persName> of Lebanon, which primarily involved loans of $5 million in 1955 and $5 million in 1956, which the Lebanese probably would wish to apply to road construction in Lebanon. Otherwise he had not availed himself of the $60 million fund, but he thought that a further sum would be required to assist in financing power installations in Syria. U.S. funds might be required for equity money, and the Syrians might be able to finance the remainder of the prospective power project from the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>. The Syrians anticipated obtaining a substantial block of power from the Yarmuk. This might not be possible, for technical reasons, and a substitute project might be necessary to assure Syrian support.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_112" n="112" facs="0140"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> then pointed out that the best argument for the plan lay in refugee resettlement. This plan is the best one we have to help solve the refugee problem, and it would go far to break the log jam posed by the attitude of many of the refugees. Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> observed that if some constructive action is not taken there might well be a war for the Jordan waters.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked about the cost of the project in Israel. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> said that appeared to be a matter of little concern to the Israelis, who seemed to feel that they would obtain their money sooner or later from their backers in the U.S. and elsewhere. He indicated that strong forces were at work in Israel encouraging the Government to start work at Jisr Banat Yaqub before July, and there would be much trouble if the Israelis did resume operations in the demilitarized zone. This was a factor in Israeli desires for a settlement of the problem in the near future.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary in congratulating Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> on the progress that he had made, summed up the conversation by stating that the immediate issue appeared to be the proper line to take with the Israelis. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> suggested that the appropriate techniques were a combination of the carrot and the stick. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> indicated his willingness to support whatever line the Secretary adopted.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then determined that we should allocate the remaining 1955 aid funds of approximately $10 million to bring Israel’s total for the year up to $40 million, that we should move slowly on the surplus food program as there appeared to be no urgency in this case, and that as far as aid for 1956 was concerned Israel’s allotment should be kept secret and buried in a regional total.</p>

                        <p>I summarized the main points of my meeting with <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> (<hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> Minutes of London meetings for March 9).<note n="2" xml:id="d51fn2">See <ref target="#d46">Document 46</ref>.</note> I said that <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> had given the proposals his approval and that he was in favor of taking them up with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> at the earliest possible moment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that he had read the summary of agreed recommendations<note n="3" xml:id="d51fn3">

                            </note> attached to the memo of March 16 and gave their concurrence to sending it following receipt of word that the Foreign Office was prepared to send a similar telegram to <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Stevenson</persName>.</p>
                        <p>I outlined the alternate methods of initiating Alpha if <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> recommended against approaching <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> at the present time, and they agreed with them.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary said that he wished me to bear in mind the possibility of obtaining, from any of the countries receiving benefits under Alpha, rights for the U.S. to construct communication centers on their territory. The grant of such rights would cost these governments nothing and would be of some value to the U.S.</p>
                        <p>Both the Under Secretary and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> expressed concern that it would be necessary for the U.S. to make financial contributions of the amount summarized in the memorandum which I prepared for the Secretary, dated February 14, 1955, which they <pb xml:id="pg_114" n="114" facs="0142"/>read.<note n="6" xml:id="d51fn6">See <ref target="#d18fn2">footnote 2, Document 18</ref>.</note> I pointed out that at the London meeting the figure which was suggested for the amount of the U.S. loan to Israel to make possible compensation to the refugees was $140 million, or $60 million lower than the figure mentioned in the February 14 memorandum.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary suggested that the question should be raised with the Secretary, after his return from Ottawa,<note n="7" xml:id="d51fn7">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> was on an official visit to Canada, March 17–19.</note> as to broadening the base of approval within the U.S. Government on U.S. financial commitments in connection with the Alpha project, and also on the proposed treaty of security guarantee.</p>
                        <p>The question should also be raised with the Secretary whether to inform Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>. It was agreed that it would be recommended to the Secretary that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> be told that the Secretary was interested in following up agreement on the Unified Jordan Valley Plan with other steps toward settlement of differences in the area, and also giving consideration as to the form that such steps might take. No details of the London agreements would be given to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>.</p>

                        <p>1531. As a result of meetings in London, Dept and <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> have agreed on terms of what they believe would constitute equitable settlement between Israel and Arab States (copy pouched to you from London<note n="2" xml:id="d52fn2">Presumably reference is to <ref target="#d48">Document 48</ref>.</note>). We are agreed, moreover, upon desirability of exploring most carefully whether an approach can be made to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> in the immediate future. We concur with <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> that we might wait in vain for a better time; that indeed there might be deterioration in area relations and possibly also in <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s domestic position in absence of measures to improve situation.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_115" n="115" facs="0143"/>
                        <p>We are fully cognizant of difficulties in an approach to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> on Alpha at this time but we are inclined to resolve doubts in favor of an approach rather than in favor of further delay. We therefore desire you discuss question with <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Stevenson</persName> and advise whether you and he believe an early approach to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> is feasible. It is contemplated that, in event approach is made, you would make it and use arguments contained in brief prepared for <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s talk with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>
                            <note n="3" xml:id="d52fn3">See <ref target="#d24">Document 24</ref>.</note> and in London Points of Agreement. You could assure <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> we would make every effort maintain complete secrecy and that we would be prepared to work out with him how a settlement would look before determining whether to proceed further.</p>
                        <p>The exact time and manner of the approach would have to take into account: necessity of not saying anything to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> which he could use to hurt Anglo-Iraq negotiations for new treaty, status of Security Council action on Gaza raid, status of negotiations on Unified Jordan Valley Plan, and, of course, <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s participation in Asia-Africa Conference.<note n="4" xml:id="d52fn4">The Asia–Africa Conference at Bandung, Indonesia, was held April 18–24, 1955.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Should initial approach be favorably received, we envisage thorough briefing for you and, at appropriate time, other key US and British representatives in area by <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName>.

                            </note> Deeply regret necessity those conclusions as know how important this subject is to Department and Secretary.</p>
                        <p>As a supplement to our agreed message following might be useful.</p>
                        <p>(a) Do not believe at this particular time <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> would find it possible to proceed even if he himself were in agreement. This is because of Gaza, internal position, complications re position before other Arab states just at time this important in view developments following Turk-Iraq pact, etc.</p>
                        <p>(b) On this particular subject there is at present danger of causing serious misunderstanding with him as to nature of US policies and methods of operation. He has not believed, but acquiesced for local and other reasons, in propaganda instigated by Saleh Salem that real motive of US behind northern tier and Turk-Iraqi pact matter was indirect method of forcing settlement and integration of Israel into defense. If at this stage <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> were to be confronted by fact that the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> have been working for some time on specific plan for settlement of Arab-Israeli dispute there is great danger he would conclude Saleh and others may have been correct.</p>
                        <p>While I thus feel strongly type of approach Department has in mind to be out of question at this stage, do not believe it necessary to avoid discussion of subject within next few weeks as opportunities rise with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> personally and alone on strictly informal basis. After such soundings (during which I can stress my own view that it is Egypt’s interest move forward on this problem) we may be in better position to advise as to future timing, etc. Department cautioned however not pin much hope on real progress being made here in near future in view general situation.</p>

                        <p>1378. I have discussed Department’s 1531<note n="2" xml:id="d54fn2">
                                <ref target="#d52">Document 52</ref>.</note> on March 19 with <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Stevenson</persName>. Following is our joint considered opinion.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Begin verbatim text:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> is sore and suspicious. It would be both unwise and useless to make official secret approach to him at the present time for following reasons:</p>
                        <p>(a) Approach would tend to persuade him of truth of his colleagues assertions that Turco-Iraqi pact was part of deep laid plot aimed by the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> at splitting the Arab world and softening Egypt up.</p>
                        <p>(b) His recent diplomatic defeat over Turco-Iraqi pact forces him for the present at any rate into a more nationalistic and thus less realistic attitude. He would therefore be quite unreceptive.</p>
                        <p>(c) Effect on [<hi rend="italic">of</hi>] Gaza incident has not scared <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>. It has merely increased his hostility to Israel.</p>
                        <p>(c) [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] Inducements on Arab side of proposed settlement re all extraneous and [<hi rend="italic">aid?</hi>] would have to be increased to an unacceptable extent to cause him even to consider them at this time.</p>
                        <p>2. A premature approach would risk setting back indefinitely any hope of settlement. But we think that if present Arab squabble can be to some extent smoothed over and <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> broadens his horizon a little by his attendance at the Afro-Asian conference it may be possible for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> to sound him out informally and unofficially after his return at the end of April.</p>
                        <p>3. US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Governments should do what they can to restore <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>s confidence in us and in himself as he remains best hope of promoting eventual settlement.</p>

                        <p>I outlined the present situation with respect to Alpha according to my Notes (attached).<note n="2" xml:id="d55fn2">Not printed.</note> I mentioned the “package” which was worked out in London in general terms (showing the Secretary the map with suggested border provisions).<note n="3" xml:id="d55fn3">See <ref target="#d47fn13">footnote 13, Document 47</ref>.</note> I said it had received <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s approval and that <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> had favored pressing ahead with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>. The Secretary made no specific comment but nodded generally.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary made the following points:</p>
                        <p>1. He believes the northern tier should be confined to the northern-tier countries. They are the ones which are required from the point of view of the military defense of the area. Jordan, Lebanon and Syria are not important from a military viewpoint. Their adherence to the Turko-Iraq Pact, on the contrary, would have two adverse effects: it would further isolate and embitter <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>, and it would give the <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss> the occasion for claiming that the US had put its political and diplomatic weight behind Israel’s Arab neighbors and therefore against Israel. Even though the US did not itself adhere to the Turko-Iraq Pact, Israel would claim that we have close relations with Turkey and with Iraq and were therefore backing the whole arrangement. The Secretary said that it looks as though the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had grabbed the ball on the northern-tier policy and was running away with it in a direction which would have the above unfortunate consequences.</p>
                        <p>2. The Secretary indicated that he attaches a high priority to the Alpha undertaking and that he sees no leader in the Arab world through whom it can be initiated besides <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>. He believes, therefore, that we must pursue policies in the area during the next few months that will help build up <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> and will give us the opportunity to say to him that we are prepared to cooperate with him in strengthening his position but that it must be accompanied by his cooperation in Alpha. The Secretary asked the officers present to give active thought to proposals that would accomplish this and come back to him with them soon. He himself suggested casually <pb xml:id="pg_119" n="119" facs="0147"/>the possibility of a conference of some kind in Cairo that would give <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> a little prestige.</p>

ReDeptel 1581.<note n="2" xml:id="d56fn2">The Department on March 23 requested the Embassy in Cairo to assess the likelihood of Egypt’s retaliating for the Gaza incident. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 682.87/3–2155)</note> We believe <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> has no intention retaliate for Gaza. <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> has sent regular army and National Guard reinforcements to El Arish area and moved up some equipment and barbed wire. All indications are that this action taken to provide against another Israeli attack.</p>
                        <p>Rumors circulate re secret preparations for retaliation in event another attack. These may have been stimulated for propaganda purposes to stop opposition elements from alleging <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> soft re Israel.</p>
                        <p>Another Gaza-like attack by Israel combined with an outcome in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> considered unsatisfactory to <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> would probably cause Egyptian frustration to reach breaking-point, particularly if combined with increased sense of isolation from Arab world and idea Egypt abandoned by US. In such circumstances we believe it possible that <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> might consider a desperate adventure in southern Negev.</p>
                        <p>Comment</p>
                        <p>Ironically enough, there is some similarity between the Egyptian and Israeli feelings of frustration and isolation. These feelings give rise to same inherent danger in both countries; i.e. if pressed too hard, they may pull the temple down.</p>

                        <p>DEAR <persName corresp="#p_GWF1">GEORGE</persName>: I am sending the attached by letter for two reasons. The first is that I do not at this point know whether to attach any great significance to this talk with <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName>. I have the feeling that he was talking as <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> the Intellectual Cosmopolite—as contrasted to <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> the realistic Arab Politician. He does, I find, play <pb xml:id="pg_121" n="121" facs="0149"/>both roles and the former can be quite disarming. Nor do I know whether <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> was speaking with the knowledge and authority of <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>. I kept wondering during this conversation if he were under instructions to find out whether the United States did in fact have a peace plan it was contemplating trying to impose upon the area as has been charged here in recent critical articles. I do not believe this to be the case but this thought made me somewhat cautious. On the other hand one might speculate that the Egyptian Government is at last really getting concerned about the impression they have been giving the United States recently. This refers of course to their desire for continued and increased assistance from the United States. If one thinks in terms of normal Middle East suspicions and politics one might also conclude that, with the uncertainty here at present, <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> had decided he might benefit in the future personally by appearing reasonable in the US eyes.</p>
                        <p>There is just a chance, however, that this conversation could be the beginning of something important. The <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> has been forced to do a lot of thinking recently as to their place in the scheme of things and this has probably included a good deal of map gazing. How, they wonder, can Egypt serve as an important base area for a forward defense when there is no land connection between Egypt and that area? There is probably an increased awareness here that Egypt is in fact isolated geographically. Even Salah Salem, in his wild ravings, told me that the Israeli problem lay at the root of all the difficulties of organizing defense of the area. If a solution could be found to this problem which would reconnect Egypt to the forward area he thought everything else would fall in line.</p>
                        <p>All of our thinking on Alpha contemplated me dealing directly with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> only. If <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> would however let <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> have a hand in this it could be a great advantage. While he might not be allowed any authority as regards decision, he is, on the other hand, a good technician and far more knowledgeable about many aspects of the general problem than <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> is likely to be.</p>
                        <p>I plan to follow through on this discussion unless you see some reason why I should not. Perhaps next time I can find out whether he is speaking with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s authority. I wish to caution again, however, that this one conversation should not lead to great expectations in the Department. I am afraid the joint conclusions of <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Stevenson</persName> and I will still prove to be valid as regards getting very far at this time. I have told <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Stevenson</persName> of this conversation with <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName>. He agrees that I should follow through on the matter but is not hopeful as to the results.</p>
                        <p>The other reason I am reporting this by letter is the question of secrecy. Three years in the Department on this subject has made me believe that it is impossible to keep the Israelis from finding out <pb xml:id="pg_122" n="122" facs="0150"/>matters we are working on of real interest to them. I feel certain, for instance, that they know more about Alpha than we suspect. Such knowledge, in my opinion, could even have been one of the motives for the Gaza raid—although of course this is speculation.</p>
                        <p>Unless you and the Secretary disagree (and barring rapid developments that would make such a course unwise) I would prefer reporting on this subject by Top Secret letter. I would of course wish the Secretary to see such letters, or if overly long, a summary you might produce. Communications to him probably should be hand carried by Rod<note n="2" xml:id="d58fn2">Roderic L. O’Connor, Special Assistant to the Secretary of State.</note> or Johnny<note n="3" xml:id="d58fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_HJWJ1">John W. Hanes, Jr.</persName>, Special Assistant to the Secretary of State.</note> for reasons Jack<note n="4" xml:id="d58fn4">

All of this of course is for you to decide and I hope you do not think I have become overly cautious regarding secrecy. I just think the task itself will be well nigh impossible even without any unnecessary complications.</p>
                        <p>My deepest appreciation for the patience the Department has exhibited since my arrival here. I am certain there have been times when you felt like letting the whole area have a great blast of righteous US indignation. Patience, however, I believe is beginning to pay dividends and I am, in general, much less discouraged than even a week ago.</p>

                            </hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I met this morning with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> at the Foreign Ministry at his request. The meeting lasted an hour and ten minutes.</p>
                        <p>I opened the conversation by stating I would appreciate an expression of his general views about the current situation. I told him of my recent long talk with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> in which Salah Salem participated in part.<note n="6" xml:id="d58fn6"> On March 20, <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> informed the Department:<p>“Yesterday <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> invited me for unannounced and locally quite secret meeting with him today outside Cairo. Conversation, almost entirely on matters arising from defense organization, lasted 6 hours without interruption. Had set as my goal convincing <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> unwisdom from Egypt’s point of view, of pursuing Saudi-Syria-Egyptian Pact. While am certain he convinced move unwise was unable devise with him any method by which proposed pact would be called off. He reiterated, almost in sadness, Egypt now too committed to change course and meetings for finalization would probably be soon.” (Telegram 1373 from Cairo; Department of State, Central Files, 611.74/3–2055)</p>
                            </note> I stated I hoped I had been able to erase some <pb xml:id="pg_123" n="123" facs="0151"/>of the suspicions from <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s mind but was certain I had failed as regards Salah Salem. There followed a general discussion in which <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> stressed the need for a calming down period. He had felt things were going in that direction until the brutally strong démarche by Turkey to Syria.<note n="7" xml:id="d58fn7">Reference is to a Turkish aide-mémoire of March 13 to Syria; it objected to the provision in the March 2 Egyptian-Syrian communiqué pledging the two governments to refrain from joining the Turkish-Iraqi pact and charged that Syria was turning away from friendship with Turkey in favor of Egypt’s negativism and hostility. (Despatch 454 from Ankara, March 14; <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> 674.83/3–1455)</note> This had only resulted in keeping emotions alive.</p>
                        <p>I asked if he felt Egypt’s draft for the proposed new arrangements with Saudi Arabia, Syria and Yemen would, in fact, contain language which would orient the pact as being hostile to defense arrangements in the north, and Iraq particularly. He replied that if we read the “whole document”, he thought we would not be too alarmed as a way would be left open for eventual cooperation between these new arrangements and those in the north. At one point he used the phrase, “if there is a pact at all”. I did not follow through on this subject because of the extremely interesting remarks he then volunteered on the subject of Israel.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> stated he believed some of the trends in the Middle East were becoming extremely dangerous and he felt that current frictions within the area must somehow be eased as quickly as possible. He listed these as: (1) Inter-Arab quarrels; (2) The Arab-Israeli problem; and (3) The recent renewal of old suspicions and hostility between Turkey and the bulk of the Arab World. He stated it must be a great source of satisfaction to Russia to watch these developments. To my surprise, he said he felt it an equal source of satisfaction for India. The motives of India, he said, might be different than those of the Kremlin but the end result turned out to be the same.</p>
                        <p>In the ensuing discussion <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> did not return to points 1 and 2 above but concentrated his remarks on the Arab-Israeli problem. He stated there were widely varying schools of thought as to when a real effort should be made to solve this problem. He personally was inclined to think that there was no time to lose. As far as Egypt was concerned there were two main problems, i.e., refugees and frontier rectifications.<note n="8" xml:id="d58fn8">Note: <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> chose to ignore the internal political problem which doing anything about Israel constitutes for the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> As regards refugees, he felt Egypt’s views more realistic than many of the Arab States. They realized that most <pb xml:id="pg_124" n="124" facs="0152"/>refugees could not return to Israel and that there could not be compensation for any but material losses. The Egyptians of course wished that the total amount of such compensation would come out of Jewish pockets but they realized this was not practical. He felt Egypt could be brought to accept the concept that others would pay through Israel. As regards territory, he said he felt it imperative that a land link be re-established between Egypt and the rest of the Arab World. By this he was not speaking of merely a “corridor” as this would only provide another artificial ambush trap for the future. He did not know the size of the strip that should be considered but felt that it should swing up in an arc to include Gaza which could be ceded to Jordan. Gaza was only a liability to Egypt and she would be glad to get rid of it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> stated he realized any politician in Israel would be hard put to accept such a solution but he felt it basically to be in Israel’s long term interests and it might help the position of their Government if they could say it was, in fact, imposed upon them. He realized as well that many Arab politicians were using the Palestine issue for their own personal advantage and this created a great problem. He felt that Lebanon and Libya probably felt about the same as Egypt. In the remaining Arab States there were only smaller circles who would be reasonable on the problem.</p>
                        <p>I asked <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> what he thought the United States could usefully do in this situation. I told him it had been a temptation during my four years of work on the Middle East to assemble our most able experts and work out what we felt to be the most practicable and acceptable solutions for each major specific problem in the Palestine question. The problem had always been what to do with such concrete views if we did make such an effort. What did he suggest the United States could do? He replied that probably the first point to be decided was whether the United States alone, the United States and other selected nations, or the United Nations itself should make the effort. He asked what were my views. I replied half jokingly I supposed the United States would get the blame in any event and then more seriously agreed that this was a problem to be studied.</p>
                        <p>Whatever his motive, <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> exhibited a sense of urgency that surprised me and his desire to continue the discussion seemed real. I told him something of the personal concern of the President and Secretary of State on this question. This included their general views as to the detriment to the entire area of this continuing feud, the difficulties it imposed upon constructive development and the building of strength in the area, and a bit of the domestic problems it caused for us at home. When I spoke of the personal conviction and <pb xml:id="pg_125" n="125" facs="0153"/>political courage of our two leaders on this subject, he warmly indicated his agreement and expressed his great personal admiration.</p>
                        <p>I told him I was certain that both of these individuals would wish me to have extremely frank and quite secret talks on this subject here in Egypt. I did not know what decisions my Government would make as to the role it could play but knew they would welcome a thorough and frank exchange of ideas with Egypt prior to deciding what role, if any, the United States could play. If we proceeded in talks of this nature, I could assure him that for my part they would be in utmost secrecy. He agreed completely upon necessity for secrecy.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> then stated that we must find a way in which politicians on both sides of the armistice line could state there had been definite gains out of cooperation on this problem. His general thesis was that in order to be able to take such steps they would have to be able to point to specific, as contrasted to vague, examples of resultant benefits in their individual countries. In this he felt economic development assistance was of primary importance, with some military aid as well as necessity. I told him I of course without instructions on such specifics but it might be—if we reached that stage—I would be given authority on such matters.</p>
                        <p>We agreed to think over each others remarks and continue the conversation at a later date.</p>

                        <p>842. Two incidents reported <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 839<note n="2" xml:id="d59fn2">Dated March 30, it reported that early that morning Egyptian troops in the Gaza Strip had opened fire on an Israeli patrol and that a platoon of Arab Legion regulars early that morning had crossed into Israel from Jordan and exchanged fire with an Israeli patrol. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>)</note> together with report Syrians used for first time anti-aircraft guns March 29 against Israel planes flying over demilitarized zone Israel-Syrian border (Damascus <pb xml:id="pg_126" n="126" facs="0154"/>telegram 537)<note n="3" xml:id="d59fn3">Not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 683.84A/3–3055)</note> seem to indicate emergence certain new factors to be considered any appraisal unstable border situation.</p>
                        <p>1. Arab States, especially Egypt, seem to be stiffening their attitude against Israel.</p>
                        <p>2. If facts reported to Embassy by <gloss target="#t_FLO1">FLO</gloss> correct, action with Jordan took place in relatively quiet zone, significant number of troops were apparently used by both sides, and action involved a crossing of demarcation line by Arab Legion in numbers. This would seem to signify change of policy by Legion which was known to have been under orders not to cross line into Israel.</p>
                        <p>3. Possibility that these three actions occurring at about same time may not be independent exists and may show coordination between Arab States.</p>
                        <p>4. Israelis following a policy of being aggressively alert, and fact that <gloss target="#t_FLO1">FLO</gloss> reports this was an army patrol engagement indicates <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> has taken over responsibility for guaranteeing portion of border formerly assigned to border police.</p>
                        <p>5. Public emotions are mounting to a higher level following continued press build-up of incidents. The special cabinet session (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 836<note n="4" xml:id="d59fn4">In telegram 836, March 30, the Embassy in Tel Aviv reported that the Israeli Cabinet met in extraordinary session on March 29 to consider the Security Council proceedings and to discuss the situation along the borders. In this connection, the Embassy observed that if Egypt failed to institute measures which would control effectively the activities along the border of its own people and the refugees, Israel would respond with military action. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 674.84A/3–3055)</note>), <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>’s visit to Pattish (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 829<note n="5" xml:id="d59fn5">Not printed.

(<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>)</note>), show degree to which government has been aroused. In this connection, <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> visit to Pattish may be significant because of danger inherent in his emotional reaction thereto contributing further support to activist sentiment within <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss>.<note n="7" xml:id="d59fn7">On March 31, in telegram 569, the Department informed the Embassy in Tel Aviv that it “sees no evidence of coordinated Arab action against Israel”.

                        <p>1643. Since receiving <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1373<note n="2" xml:id="d60fn2">See <ref target="#d58fn6">footnote 6, Document 58</ref>.</note> Dept has been considering at top level possible measures which would provide <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> way out of impasse resulting from his attack on Turk-Iraq Pact, permit him to gain new prestige and influence in Middle East, and thus enable him to take initiative in launching Alpha. Obviously area defense arrangements are involved in such a review. We would hope to convince <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> that we attach great importance to Egypt’s position in the Middle East and to his influence and cooperation; that we are desirous of extending our support and assistance—political, economic, and military—to Egypt and in general of assisting Egypt to achieve the international standing to which she is entitled to aspire.</p>
                        <p>There are two basic prerequisites to our extending such support:</p>
                        <p>(1) There must be continued progress toward firming up the Northern Tier (Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan). This is required by the interest of the Free World in maintaining the integrity of the Middle East against assault from the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>(2) There must be a realistic and reasonably early prospect of a settlement of the major issues between Israel and Egypt as US cannot otherwise adequately help Egypt.</p>
                        <p>In other respects there is wide flexibility and we would welcome suggestions by <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>. <gloss target="#t_ONE1">One</gloss> approach which you might suggest to him before his departure for Asian-African Conference or after his return would be that Egypt and US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> cooperate along following lines:</p>
                        <p>1. Northern Tier concept to continue as grouping of Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. Adherence of additional Arab states at this time to Turk-Iraq Pact will not be sought by US directly or indirectly.</p>
                        <p>2. Egypt to participate in Middle East defense, possibly through adherence to Turk-Pakistan Pact. Since this agreement more loosely worded than Turk-Iraq Pact and poses less specific obligations on parties, it more likely prove acceptable to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> initiate steps towards settlement principal Arab-Israel issues (Alpha). In your presentation you would include considerations mentioned para 2 <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 1531.<note n="3" xml:id="d60fn3">

                        <p>4. In any conference of Arab states (Damascus <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 524)<note n="4" xml:id="d60fn4">Not printed. (Department of State, Central Files, 786.5/3–2555)</note> US would hope <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> would work for a constructive orientation which would make possible increased US support for Arab states.</p>
                        <p>Basic pattern would thus be: (a) tightly-knit military cooperation by states along northern tier; (b) association by Egypt with Turkey and Pakistan in a looser form of association appropriate to remoter area; (c) concentration on Arab development through constructive inter-Arab cooperation.</p>
                        <p>The above would be put to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> not as definite US policy but as response to his request for suggestions for way out of his impasse (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1373).

(<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 682.87/4–155.)</note> immediately preceding, in conveying Foreign Office concern at apparent divergence views of US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> re Northern Tier, <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> also referred to proposal in <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 4997,<note n="3" xml:id="d61fn3">Printed as telegram 1643, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note> of which Foreign Office had learned from British Embassy Washington, that consideration be given to approaching <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> re Alpha before Afro-Asian Conference and to talking to him about Middle East defense along lines indicated Department reference telegram. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> said he must point out it had been agreed following recommendations of Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Stevenson</persName> and <pb xml:id="pg_129" n="129" facs="0157"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> that approach to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> would not be made until latter’s return from Afro-Asian Conference. He pointed out <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> departing April 8 and it not advisable in British view approach him before that time.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> said he was coming more and more to regard it as urgent that Alpha be put into operation as soon as possible after <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s return from Bandung, but not before. Moreover, when this step taken it should be done in formal and considered fashion and all tangible and intangible benefits should be presented to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>, though not necessarily all details. British did not favor another oblique approach to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> such as <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> had made.</p>
                        <p>He also saw some inconsistency between (1) Department’s apparent preference that Northern Tier be limited to Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> at this time, and (2) suggestion that Egypt be urged participate in Middle East defense through adherence Turkish-Pakistan Pact.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> added that in his view it would be extremely unwise to inform <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> that we were thinking of advising Jordan or any other Arab State against joining Turkish-Iraqi Pact since this would put us in the position of giving <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> what he wanted before getting anything from him. British were aware of need for doing something for <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> but had just released certain military equipment to Egypt which should take <gloss target="#t_CARE1">care</gloss> of immediate problem.</p>

For reasons outlined in letter I felt it wise <pb xml:id="pg_130" n="130" facs="0158"/>to be cautious this first conversation on subj, particularly with <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName>. Discussion however seemed possibly be of such significance that I decided for purpose of secrecy to communicate to Dept by ltr. General nature of conversation given to <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Stevenson</persName> who as well reported by ltr. Am now reporting by cable as find Top Secret pouch too infrequent but hope greatest security precautions will be taken. In interval between conversation reported my March 26 [<hi rend="italic">27</hi>] ltr and today’s conversation reported below, <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> indicated to me in aside at social gathering that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> and only <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> would be informed our talks this subj. This of course significant and led <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Stevenson</persName> and me conclude I should at appropriate time explore matter further.</p>
                        <p>I called on <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> this morning to comply with Dept’s tel 1648.<note n="4" xml:id="d62fn4">The Department on March 31 informed <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LEB1">Lawson</persName> that it wished to use the U.N. Security Council resolutions on Gaza “as points departure for determined effort arrest growing chain incidents Israel border particularly vicinity Gaza strip.” It instructed <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LEB1">Lawson</persName> to approach <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> and, “using firm language”, make “clear it inconceivable to US that either side would permit situation get out of hand.” They were to emphasize that “events flowing from Gaza attack demonstrate conclusively fallacy doctrine retaliation as means bringing about improvement Arab-Israel situation”; that both sides were responsible for failing to take adequate measures to control local elements in the Gaza area; and that the “ominousness of situation requires that top officials both governments devote personal attention to problem.” (Department of State, Central Files, 674.84A/3–3155)</note> This discussion (reported separately)<note n="5" xml:id="d62fn5">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> informed the Department on April 3 that he had “strongly presented Department’s views this morning supplemented by points from various cables from Tel Aviv re danger of provoking Israeli in their emotional state following <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> action”, and that <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> had expressed his appreciation for the “concern of US Government”, “hoped every effort would … be made by both sides to strengthen armistice machinery”, and “said <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> ready discuss and cooperate on ‘practical system’ whereby the armistice machinery can be strengthened.” (Telegram 1461 from Cairo; <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> 674.84A/4–355)</note> led naturally to exploration possibilities Alpha-type operation.</p>
                        <p>I asked <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> if he had considered further desirability more fundamental approach to Arab-Israeli problem. He stated that he had devoted considerable time this subj recently and had number talks with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>. He had cancelled his scheduled meetings with other Arab reps this morning, hoping we might explore matter further. He particularly interested my reactions and second thoughts following our earlier talk. I was faced with choice of backing away from subj or going ahead. I chose latter course.</p>
                        <p>In two-hour discussion which followed I presented our views along lines general approach that had been prepared for <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> and available to Dept.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, I said:</p>
                        <p>(1) Had been greatly encouraged by his earlier remarks re need for early comprehensive settlement.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_131" n="131" facs="0159"/>
                        <p>(2) <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> had recently reached same conclusions as he re necessity for prompt action—and for much the same reasons as put forward by him. In discussions with <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>
                            <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> found him very much of same mind.</p>
                        <p>(3) In view of above and staff work that had followed, I felt in position to talk with some assurance re views <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> which I felt substantially shared by <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>(4) <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> well aware dangers present situation which he himself had so well expressed. These elaborated upon briefly.</p>
                        <p>(5) Besides these dangers, this dispute preventing constructive development of Arab States and area generally. We wished to see strong and progressive Egypt. We admire <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s efforts that direction and wished be of all possible assistance. The same was true of <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. Arab-Israeli dispute hampered us all greatly in assisting Egypt and in getting on with constructive efforts towards stability and strength of area.</p>
                        <p>(6) Because of Egypt’s position in <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> and her realism US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had decided talk with her first. Egypt has taken positive attitude re Jordan valley proposals. This has raised her stature in eyes of world. Task of achieving wider settlement is great challenge of statesmanship to all of us.</p>
                        <p>(7) What we hoping, therefore, is that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> will be disposed accept practical realistic settlement and will help us to work for it.</p>
                        <p>(8) There were, we believed, special arguments of a tactical nature for selecting this time to make effort. US has been following tough policy of deflating Israel. We had refused arms and Israel’s attempts obtain defense agreements and special milit arrangements, including guarantees. Our financial assistance had fallen off. There many examples moves of this nature, taken under great difficulty by US. We believed net result was to inject realism into Israeli thinking. This policy had, however, made Israel feel frustrated and insecure. <gloss target="#t_ONE1">One</gloss> must judge with great care how far it profitable carry such a course. Personally felt it extremely dangerous for all <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> to attempt maintain this policy much longer even if we were in fact able to do so. All in all, this seemed best time to try for settlement.</p>
                        <p>(9) We must face realities and administration, while always faced with difficulties this subj, obviously freer now than later on in midst of campaign.</p>
                        <p>(10) Our view is that we should work out with Egypt a basic plan and then tactics. If this went well we could then determine manner in which Israel and other Arab States should be approached.</p>
                        <p>(11) In a general way what we had in mind was slightly smaller Israel. He must know that we did not believe practicable any radical frontier change along lines 1947 <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution. If general settlement could be reached with more practical border believed security guarantee from Western nations might be possible on question of maintenance those borders. In conjunction general settlement this should have great calming effect upon whole area. We believe in adequate compensation plus resettlement of refugees. Arabs, of course, would have to abandon econ warfare. Problems of utilization of Jordan waters, Jerusalem, communications, ports, transit areas, etc would all have to be gone into. We were not seeking over-night direct relations between Arab States and Israel and would do all possible <pb xml:id="pg_132" n="132" facs="0160"/>make settlement palatable Arab opinion. Nor were we striving for one comprehensive agreement neatly bound in pink ribbons. Elements of problem might be approached separately and quite differently. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> for instance might be used to record in resolution agreements reached on matters such as refugees and Jerusalem. We felt most strongly, however, that end result all agreements and arrangements must be clear end to state of belligerency or pretensions such belligerency.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> said he was in complete agreement re general approach and timing. He particularly agreed timing. Stated he believed “iron was now hot”. He felt that with delay, events and dispositions might change in unfavorable fashion. He said 1955 held greatest possibilities for success; if things were left to drift until next year he himself had little hope of averting disaster in <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Re <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, he agreed that US, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Egypt must work together for day when meeting of minds achieved in complete secrecy among Cairo, London, Washington and Tel Aviv. Suggested that he and I both should let <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Stevenson</persName> know we working in exploratory way on this subj.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> made point that solution must be found which both sides can advertise as a victory but that secretly both sides would consider equally unsatisfactory. This best that could be hoped for. Criticism and emotions would be raised against us all and Egypt would certainly receive her share but we must proceed with determination and conviction that we are working in best interests of all concerned. If plan carried through we could at least feel that for future generations we had ended misery million people and had eased most dangerous problem of insecurity. Crucial of course would be Israel reaction when time agreed for them be approached.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> then reiterated Egyptians’ views on refugees and territorial adjustments as given me previously and reported by letter. I told him, altho from practical viewpoint Negev relatively worthless territory, could not conceive of Israel agreeing any territorial concession there beyond minimum necessary for practical connecting ground link for Egypt with Jordan. <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> recognized this but felt that old strictly corridor approach would not be enough for Egypt. He realized <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> idea of larger link might present US with impossible problem but did not want it ruled out of discussion.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> stated we embarking task in which those working on problem should first be convinced themselves of both wisdom and possibility of going forward. With this in mind he suggested it would be profitable for me to develop matter in similar fashion with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> when I see him alone on Monday night. After that he felt we should wait until after Bandung.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_133" n="133" facs="0161"/>
                        <p>I asked how he felt future conversations should be carried on. This was large undertaking. Could he himself devote the necessary time to serve as technician on the many complicated aspects of the problem? He replied after Bandung we should try to reach a meeting of the minds as to whole general approach. If this should prove possible, we could then consider necessity using a minimum of carefully selected experts to develop some of the more technical aspects.</p>
                        <p>This terminated discussion this subj.</p>
                        <p>Plan to discuss subj generally along with other matters with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> on Monday night. This may give us far better clue as to what possibilities are and will withhold further comment until after that meeting. In meantime, Dept again cautioned (as in letter) we unable as yet to weigh significance of what appears on surface to be extremely encouraging development.</p>
                        <p>Have let <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Stevenson</persName> read this cable.

(U.N. doc. S/3385) On April 6, the Security Council met, heard statements by the Israeli and Egyptian representatives, and adjourned pending receipt of the findings of the Mixed Armistice Commission. (U.N. doc. <gloss target="#t_SPV1">S/PV</gloss>.697)</p>
                        <p>On April 14, Major General E.L.M. Bums, Chief of Staff of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization, reported to the Security Council that the most important factor contributing to increased tension following the action at Gaza had been the mining of tracks used by Israeli army vehicles. To reduce these incidents and improve the situation in the Gaza area, Bums urged the immediate institution of joint patrols. Egypt had notified him of its willingness in principle to establish such patrols, but he had not received a final reply from the Israeli authorities. Both sides, he reported, were prepared to effect a local commanders’ agreement and had given verbal assurances that they were employing only regular army and police personnel along the demarcation line. The Israeli authorities favored the erection of obstacles to help prevent infiltration, and the Egyptian authorities, while seeing difficulties in connection with that <pb xml:id="pg_135" n="135" facs="0163"/>proposal, were prepared to consider ways and means of carrying it out. Lastly, <persName>Burns</persName> reported that, at Egyptian request, he was posting additional United Nations Military Observers on the Egyptian side of the demarcation line. (U.N. doc. S/3390 and Add. 1)</p>
                        <p>On April 18, the Egyptian Representative informed the Security Council that Egyptian military authorities would soon begin construction of barbed wire fences within Egyptian-controlled territory along the line running through certain essential positions on the demarcation line. (U.N. doc. S/3393) On April 19, after a brief discussion by the Council, the President of the Council observed that the majority apparently saw no need for any new action, since the possible measures to avert incidents in the area of the demarcation line had been fully covered in the Council’s resolutions of March 29 and 30.

                        <p>858. Saw Prime Minister in Jerusalem at his urgent request afternoon April 4. Neither British nor French Ambassadors were called in. Almost immediately <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>, more disturbed than I have ever seen him, spoke in substance as follows:</p>
                        <p>Situation has gone from bad to worse, is now completely untenable. Egyptians are employing two established tactics (1) placing mines inside Israel territory along Gaza border, when necessary under covering fire from positions on their side—Israelis had “surprised” mine-laying parties and on two occasions, ascertained that they were Egyptian soldiers (2) were opening fire on any Israel patrol that came within sight apparently on standing instructions to do so. Here Prime Minister digressed briefly to describe incident reported in Jerusalem 262 to Department.<note n="2" xml:id="d65fn2">See <ref target="#d63fn2">footnote 2, Document 63</ref>.</note> He denied categorically and with some heat the report that Israel had fired first and expressed displeasure over wording of <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> communiqué giving possible inference Israel forces started shooting. He emphasized the <pb xml:id="pg_136" n="136" facs="0164"/>fact that Israeli forces were on completely open and exposed ground with no place for shelter that the patrol was completely surprised by the Egyptians and this accounted for the considerable number of casualties on the Israeli side. He stated that the Israelis returned the Egyptian fire and signaled for rear support which fired upon the Egyptians position to destroy it and at the same time permit the Israeli patrol to remove their injured and dead. Then, Egyptian support positions in rear of original Egyptian attack position directed artillery fire at Israel support positions, an action which he believed was the first of its kind between the Egyptian and Israeli forces. Finally Israel forces crossed the border to destroy the original source of attack but found that the attackers had retreated.</p>
                        <p>The chain of events is not going to “fizzle out”, but “will either continue or be immediately and sharply stopped.” “We are not going to withdraw our patrols. They are there to protect our settlers. If they were not there the settlers could not work in their fields and they could not harvest their crops. They would soon be overrun by people from the Gaza strip. Our patrols take their lives in their hands every time they go out. We cannot permit them to go out without protection and we are going to supply that protection.” As long as this situation remains “we shall have to hit back.” Nothing in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> charter precludes nation acting in self-defense. If present state of affairs goes on “then it is goodbye to the armistice agreement.” Such will be the inevitable outcome. We do not wish this to happen, you do not want this to happen.</p>
                        <p>I interrupted to inject question “with regard to the contemplated <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> action in the event provocative conditions continue on the border, I take it that such action would be purely defensive.” He replied “defensive action involves a reply to a provocative attack and often involves crossing of the line to destroy the source of attack, then the other side comes into our territory and the situation builds up to a major action.”</p>
                        <p>(He again briefly digressed to state Egyptians had in effect declared <gloss target="#t_GAA1">GAA</gloss> void by their aggressive declarations, their Suez blockade, and their actions in present situation.)</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister then declared: “<persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> must be talked to as never before if he doesn’t want hopeless trouble. This must be stopped. The Egyptians must be ordered to cease firing on our patrols without provocation. Are they asking for trouble?”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> continued: According <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> information Egyptians have brought special para-military unit about 1,000 strong to Gaza strip. This unit (“fidayun” Arabic for “self-sacrifices” a unit designed for offensive action people capable of carrying out attack such as Pattish, he stated) had been employed against British in Suez Canal Zone, now is being used for acts of terrorism from Gaza base. <pb xml:id="pg_137" n="137" facs="0165"/>Egyptians must withdraw this unit. They are guilty of carrying out a deliberate aggressive plan as long as it remains there. I gave no other purpose. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> added that the Egyptians were being so “deliberate” that they were using “primitive” mines designed to disguise their army origin.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> then said in substance: Having pondered your government’s message (my talk with him regarding <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 571,<note n="3" xml:id="d65fn3">Same as telegram 1648 to Cairo; see <ref target="#d62fn4">footnote 4, Document 62</ref>.</note> see <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 848<note n="4" xml:id="d65fn4">In this telegram, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LEB1">Lawson</persName> reported on April 2 that he had conveyed the Department’s message contained in telegram 571 to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>, who indicated “Israel’s general willingness to cooperate with <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss>.” (Department of State, Central Files, 674.84A/4–255)</note>) I am going to take a leaf out of your own book. I am asking your government to seek to arrange a meeting between top level Egyptian and Israel representatives to consider means whereby the present state of affairs can be prevented from “deteriorating into disaster” to “bring under immediate control a situation pregnant with infinitely grave possibilities.”</p>
                        <p>I then asked directly “was this extraordinary meeting of the cabinet (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 855<note n="5" xml:id="d65fn5">The Embassy in Tel Aviv reported on April 4 that the Israeli Cabinet had met that morning for the second time within the week “to discuss Egyptian border problem … [which] indicates gravity with which <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> views situation and that issue further retaliation being seriously debated.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 674.84A/4–455)</note>) called solely to discuss the Gaza border situation or for other purposes also?” He replied in substance as follows: Yes, solely to discuss the Gaza situation to review our position and “the conclusions to be drawn from the present situation.” To consider my approach to your government as I am now making it to point up the untenable situation existing, and the necessity for us to defend our patrols and settlers, and to request strong and emphatic action by your government with the purpose of influencing the Egyptians to stop their provocative actions. The cabinet fully approved of this action on my part as well as our specific request for the good offices of the US in promoting top level discussions between the Egyptian Government and the Israeli Government.</p>
                        <p>“We had already decided to request an urgent meeting of the Security Council to consider the deteriorating border relations between Israel and Egypt with special reference to the Pattish murder operation, the continuous mining of our territory by trained Egyptian mine layers and the firing on our patrols by Egyptian military forces. Instructions along these lines have been sent to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>.”</p>
                        <p>I then asked the Prime Minister if I could briefly summarize the points he had made which were as follows: (a) The persistent mining of Israel territory by Egyptian military personnel or others trained in <pb xml:id="pg_138" n="138" facs="0166"/>mine laying must cease; (b) Egyptian military forces firing on Israel military patrols without provocation, which he emphasized was persistent, frequent and indicated definite instructions on the part of the Egyptian Government to do so must cease; and that he claimed that this was the pattern which the <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> apparently had decided to continue and if that were true it meant trouble; (c) The assignment by the <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> of the “suicide group” of irregulars to the Gaza strip for terrorist purposes was an action which in itself supports the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> belief that the present pattern of provocative actions is organized and ordered by <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss>, and that this body of irregulars must be withdrawn; (d) <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> agrees with <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> opinion that the situation is ominous and that the problem should be handled by top-level officials of both governments and that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> was making the positive suggestion that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> do what it could to bring about an immediate conference between Israeli and Egyptian high officials with the objective of removing current trouble making conditions on the border.</p>
                        <p>I then asked the question “is it your intention to limit these discussions to the problem of border trouble?” He replied “Yes [”] limited solely to that question no reference to be made to the overall peace settlement to <hi rend="italic">Bat Galim</hi> or other current problems with Egypt.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister confirmed the points of my summary.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> concluded the interview by saying gravely and with apparent sincerity; “I would be the happiest of men if within 24 or 28 hours I am able to tell my colleagues this meeting will take place and there will be quiet on the Gaza border.”</p>
                        <p>I promised <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> that I would convey this request to my government.</p>
                        <p>Reply <gloss target="#t_Niact1">niact</gloss> would be appreciated.<note n="6" xml:id="d65fn6">

                        <p>859. Embassy submits the following comments in regards to <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>’s presentation yesterday as reported <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 858:<note n="2" xml:id="d66fn2">
                                <hi rend="italic">Supra.</hi>
                            </note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Consideration of the Egyptian problem at four Cabinet meetings, two of them extraordinary, within a nine day period creates the presumption that the situation is regarded here as of such gravity that it cannot be placed in the same category as the recurring “crises” which have characterized Arab-Israel relations since the armistice.</p>
                        <p>2. In the Embassy’s judgment, the majority of Israel Cabinet members believe the situation along Egyptian border has become intolerable and that something will have to be done soon.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> yesterday afternoon gave the impression of a man under great emotional strain who had been subjected to strong pressures from his colleagues during the morning Cabinet session. His demeanor and his words gave the impression that he may have been given a last chance within a limited time period to achieve a settlement with Egypt, failing which military means might be adopted to effect a transition from an armistice to a peace arrangement between Israel and Egypt.</p>
                        <p>4. In view of Israel’s past record of using dramatic means to obtain western power assistance in various projects vis-à-vis the Arabs, Embassy has not excluded the possibility that moves adopted yesterday to obtain action through the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> have a tactical purpose. Certainly this demonstration of willingness to use pacific means should prove most useful to Israel from standpoint world opinion in case open warfare with Egypt ultimately occurs.</p>
                        <p>5. Nevertheless the preponderance of the evidence here points to conclusion that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> and Israel people are indeed earnest and it would be unfortunate if the <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> pursued a course of action based on the assumption that most that could happen would be localized retaliation and counter-retaliation.</p>
                        <p>Firstly, the <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> and Israel people generally share the view that time is working against them; that US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> policy and program in the area will ultimately result shift balance military power which will enable Arabs to do what their leaders have consistently said they would do; namely, push Israelis into the sea. The effect of this psychosis is to remove the normal caution which deters military actions through fear that they might lead to something bigger.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_140" n="140" facs="0168"/>
                        <p>Prevailing mood is that if there has to be a second round much better to have it now than later.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, sources available to the Embassy within and without government point to the conclusion that <persName corresp="#p_MM2">Ben-Gurion</persName>, supported by the <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> and such <gloss target="#t_Mapai1">Mapai</gloss> “old guard” members as Aranne and Eshkol, is dominating the formulation of foreign policy. Their activist propensities may be somewhat strengthened during this election period by the growing appeal to the younger voters of <gloss target="#t_AchdutHaavoda1">Achdut Haavoda</gloss> with its militant foreign policy program.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, members of the government are known to have been giving- close consideration to the Arab political situation generally, and it is a reasonable assumption that they have arrived at the conclusion that divisive forces growing out of the leadership contest between Iraq and Egypt are so great as to minimize the possibilities of collective Arab military action in any short period of time and from military standpoint the <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> may feel that a short period is sufficient to deal with Egyptian forces north of Suez.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the failure of <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> to make any reference to the portion of the Department’s message<note n="3" xml:id="d66fn3">Presumably reference is to telegram 1648 to Cairo; see <ref target="#d62fn4">footnote 4, Document 62</ref>.</note> dealing with General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> program may be symptomatic of a general Israel feeling, particularly within the <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss>, that <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> is not and will not be in the future an effective instrument and that real stability on the border can only be achieved by creating the will among the Egyptians as the Israelis say they have already done in the case of the Jordanians to control effectively the borders situation. This tendency discount in advance <persName>Burns</persName> efforts may also reflect basic attitude among <gloss target="#t_Mapai1">Mapai</gloss> leadership as became apparent during <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> water negotiations that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> efforts in area were infringement Israel sovereignty and that time had come to decrease rather than increase <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> responsibilities.</p>
                        <p>While the Embassy does not want to be unduly alarmist, its conclusion is that <gloss target="#t_IndashE1">I–E</gloss> situation has changed from static to dynamic one and that the possibilities military operations should not be minimized if <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>’s new effort through <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and security council does not result quick and effective improvement border situation.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 774.00/4–555)</note>) fell about equally on Arab States matters and Alpha, with the two becoming often rather hopelessly enmeshed. I repeated to him substantially my presentation to <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1458 repeated London 310<note n="3" xml:id="d67fn3">

Found him less forthcoming than <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> but with agreement that matter should be developed further after Bandung. He aware that this subject is basic cause of most of present day difficulties. He unable to see, however, his really taking initiative until things had calmed down somewhat in Arab world. Felt enemies would even accuse him of falling into deliberate plot to further weaken Egypt’s position in Arab world. However, he desperately wished land connections from Egypt to other Arab states.</p>
                        <p>It was too much to expect him to be decisive on Alpha at a time when he unable to be certain of Egypt’s general role on Middle East matters as a whole. I do not regret, however, launching Alpha at this stage. There was really no alternative. He wants relationship between the West and Egypt to be one of “no surprises”. Am certain he will have more trust and confidence if we don’t try to be diplomatically cautious as to our own requirements. While the joint estimate of <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Stevenson</persName> and myself is still probably correct as to what <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> can and cannot do at present, I believe there no harm our laying our cards on the table as to what we really want.</p>
                        <p>We now have to wait and see. Am inclined to believe, barring some new external developments, that he will be willing to see planning go forward after Bandung in secret but without commitment.<note n="4" xml:id="d67fn4">The Embassy in London reported that <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> had been informed of the contents of this telegram, and that he concurred with <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName>’s recommendation to delay Alpha’s launching until after <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> returned from Bandung.

Israel willing to meet Egypt either at Kilo 95 or some place in Europe. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> imagined Egypt might prefer European meeting as easier protect secrecy there. He said representatives of Egypt and Israel should have sufficient authority commit governments to specific proposals for relief border tensions. He pointed out that Israel could convoke meeting under Article 12 <gloss target="#t_GAA1">GAA</gloss>

                                <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> reported on April 5 that he had had a discussion the previous evening with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>, who, among other points, “gave me his personal word that Egyptian Government not involved in Pattish incident or land mine cases”; that “he did not want war with Israel and Gaza not worth fighting for”; but that “if there was another Israeli attack upon his armed forces he would have to react other than through United Nations.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 674.84A/4–555)</note>), … information from Egyptian War Department (Embassy tel 1471<note n="3" xml:id="d69fn3">Not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 674.83/4–455)</note>) when read in conjunction latest cables from Tel Aviv make it clear that Egyptian-Israeli tension reaching, or has reached, new and dangerous high. Incidents are rarely clear cut, but am convinced Egypt has no interest in touching off war with Israel at this time. I believe <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s statement this effect and that within limits human endurance he will exert his influence in direction of caution and restraint of hot heads. On other hand, he cannot take another Gaza-like attack by Israelis lying down without seriously jeopardizing his leadership on Egypt.</p>
                        <p>There probably has been some skulduggery from Egyptian side since Gaza, in addition intelligence gathering which <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> admitted. Altho Israelis may continue to insist otherwise, believe history of border indicates some time required for area to calm down after Israelian military action.</p>
                        <p>Have made Department’s views unmistakably clear to both <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> and have supplemented this démarche by warning re situation inside Israel. Today we received more evidence that they took our approaches seriously.</p>
                        <p>Can not help but associate final para Tel Aviv’s 855<note n="4" xml:id="d69fn4">The Embassy in Tel Aviv reported on April 4 that one element within the Israeli Government, largely within the Foreign Ministry, believed <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s survival was in the long-term interest of Israel, while another element had adopted the contrasting attitude that Israel’s interests would be better served if <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s regime fell and was replaced by a weaker government. It was significant, the Embassy believed, that both groups assumed that the “position <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> is a fragile one and that Israel military action might be decisive in leading to its collapse.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 674.84A/4–455)</note> re fluctuating attitude Israeli Govt towards <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> regime. <gloss target="#t_ONE1">One</gloss> fact I think we must weigh carefully is whether there will be Israeli attempts by <pb xml:id="pg_145" n="145" facs="0173"/>aggression to destroy present Government of Egypt. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> would have two alternatives (a) to take it lying down or (b) launch counter-operations which would without doubt end in defeat for Egypt. I doubt that United States could save <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> in either event.</p>
                        <p>Of even more importance is our own position vis-à-vis Middle East as whole if there is repetition of Gaza-like attack or as appears, possibly a worse incident. United States position in Arab States will suffer drastically in event we unable to take some dramatic act in addition to normal <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> recourse.</p>
                        <p>Have just received Tel Aviv’s 187 and 188.<note n="5" xml:id="d69fn5">Printed as <ref target="#d65">Documents 65</ref> and <ref target="#d66">66</ref>.</note> It should be recalled Egyptians have promised cooperate with General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> on carrying out recent Sugar Charlie [<gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>] resolution re border situation, This probably far easier for <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> in period following Gaza than for him send high level emissary to meet with Israelis. If Department decides comply <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>’s request for use our good offices arranging such a meeting believe it important that we take position General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> be present as observer. While I hesitate make recommendation, am inclined to think we should tell Israelis <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> has just passed resolution on best way to deal with borders situations and that Egyptians have promised to cooperate. We could separately thru <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> urge <persName>Burns</persName> arrive on the spot without delay.</p>
                        <p>In addition US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> can again talk even more sternly to both sides. We might in addition consider strengthening <persName>Burns</persName>’ hand thru <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> by immediate increase his facilities including more observers, helicopters and own logistics facilities.</p>
                        <p>If above not sufficient to deal with situation believe United States Government, in conjunction <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and perhaps others, faced with most difficult decision. Perhaps nothing will suffice but some act implying a willingness use measure of force, not necessarily military but perhaps with implication this ultimate possibility.</p>

                        <p>During the course of a conversation with the Secretary this afternoon, Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger Makins</persName> said he gathered that the Alpha exercise was proceeding satisfactorily. He said that the British fully supported <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName>’s initiative in his recent talk with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>
                            <note n="2" xml:id="d70fn2">See <ref target="#d67">Document 67</ref>.</note> and had sent a message to <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Stevenson</persName> to express support for the line <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> had taken with the Egyptians. The British felt that <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName>’s action had been constructive and were pleased that there had been no violent reaction from <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>. The Secretary agreed that <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName>’s talk had been useful and explained that it had come about in the course of a long dinner and conversation with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>, and not as a result of instructions to <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> specifically to raise this question. Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger</persName> indicated awareness of this and repeated his assertion that the British thought this had been useful.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then commented that there seemed to have been a little difficulty with respect to Jordan and the Northern Tier, but he understood that this was now straightened out. He had sent instructions that we were neither to encourage nor discourage Jordan or the other Arab States from joining the Turk-Iraq Pact. Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger</persName> said he was familiar with the instructions we had sent and felt they were satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then said that there was one very real difficulty we have which he was not entirely certain the British were aware of. He said that if Jordan now joined the Turk-Iraq Pact, it would not only increase the difficulty in giving any military assistance to Jordan but would also very substantially increase the difficulty of the US in giving any military aid to Iraq. The US Government had been under heavy pressure from the Jewish elements in this country for extending military aid to Iraq. It had justified such aid on the grounds of the Northern Tier concept and the fact that Iraq and Israel were not territorially contiguous. If Jordan joined in an alliance with Iraq, the justification for giving military assistance to Iraq would be seriously compromised. Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger</persName> said he could well understand our problem. The concern of the British Government had been that if the US took a position that Jordan should not join the <pb xml:id="pg_147" n="147" facs="0175"/>Turk-Iraq Treaty, the Egyptians would be encouraged to continue and to step up their efforts together with the Syrians and the Saudi Arabians at the expense of Iraq and the general situation in the area.</p>

                        <p>Bums regards danger major clash sufficiently imminent to require some action without delay.

                        <p>Following is message from Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> to Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>:</p>
                        <p>“My reply to your personal messages which I very deeply appreciated has been delayed in view of your absences from Washington and the succession of events within the region which called for a reappraisal of the situation on our part.</p>
                        <p>“It was gratifying and highly important for us to learn from you direct that you were fully alive to Israel’s anxieties and personally concerned to find ways and means of allaying them.</p>
                        <p>“We are vitally interested to see the defences of democracy strengthened everywhere and our own region safeguarded against the dangers threatening it. Yet we cannot but be acutely mindful of the perils with which certain defence alliances are fraught for our own security.</p>
                        <p>“The Middle East is beginning be a network of pacts from which Israel is excluded not only as a participant but even as a candidate for participation. In the case of the Suez Zone agreement she is singled out for not being even a beneficiary. All the Arab States concerned are active enemies of Israel. They profess a fierce desire see Israel obliterated. Their ‘peace terms’ spell Israel’s doom. Their association in a western defence system without a prior change in their attitude inevitably hardens their intransigence. Their arming is a direct threat to Israel’s survival.</p>
                        <p>“The Turco-Iraqi pact is a notable case in point. Far from abating her hostility to Israel, Iraq has managed through the pact to wring from Turkey a commitment to support the anti-Israel case. This can hardly advance the cause of peace in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>“We fully agree that the region’s defences against the possibility of outside aggression must be buttressed but we cannot contemplate <pb xml:id="pg_150" n="150" facs="0178"/>with equanimity this being attempted at the expense of our security and international position within the region. That the regional balance of strength should not be upset to our detriment is to us of paramount importance. We were therefore happy to learn that some form of security commitment to Israel was under your active consideration. What we would welcome is the conclusion of a defence treaty between the United States and ourselves, such as would guarantee the territorial integrity of Israel and assure us an arms supply corresponding to that offered to the Arab States.</p>
                        <p>“As things stand, the sense of isolation prevalent amongst our people is deepening. It is partly against that background that the Gaza incident—in itself a reaction to extreme provocation and the result of the breakdown of patience long maintained—should be viewed. This isolated and exceptional occurrence must be considered as an act of self-defense of a beleaguered nation surrounded by enemies and increasingly encircled by the growth of military alliances either ignoring her existence or actively directed against her.</p>
                        <p>“What you said about the Gaza incident in your second message has received our deepest attention. The Government of Israel is as ever resolved to do its utmost to reduce existing tension. It cannot naturally divest itself of responsibility for the defence of its territory and population. As I write, the loss of life amongst our troops and settlers as a result of Egyptian offensive action is a weekly occurrence and the restraint of our people is again severely tried. Egypt must be prevailed upon to put an end to murderous aggression. For our part, it is our determined policy faithfully to observe the armistice agreement in the expectation that the other side will be induced to act likewise. You will appreciate that a continued and systematic one-sided violation of the armistice agreement is liable to reduce it to naught.</p>
                        <p>“The situation is complex. It would be of great help if you could possibly take me into your confidence as to the action the United States intends taking in the near future for the Middle East and in particular as to the exact steps contemplated regarding Israel. Advance knowledge might be helpful in achieving a common policy or would at any rate eliminate unnecessary misunderstanding. Your intermittent discussions with our Ambassador, as you indicated, have been in progress since last August, and I hope I will not be pressing you unduly by saying that an early clarification of the position and prospects would be extremely valuable.</p>
                        <p>“As for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>’s mission, you are doubtless aware that he has succeeded, by dint of skillful and painstaking negotiation, in narrowing considerably the gap between conflicting claim and clearing up some of the points at issue between him and ourselves. I am now soberly hopeful of an early solution which would satisfy Israel’s minimum water requirements without interfering with her sovereignty or imperilling her territorial integrity. Coupled with a fair share of the waters these are the prerequisites of any agreement to which we should be a party.</p>
                        <p>“I must apologize for the length of this message, in the composition of which I was encouraged by the sympathetic understanding which you have always brought to bear upon the examination of our problems both before and since you took office.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_151" n="151" facs="0179"/>
                        <p>“With greetings and best wishes for your health and strength and for the success of the great work in which you are engaged on behalf of the entire free world.”</p>

                        <p>1551. There are so many local and external factors that will have a bearing upon success or failure of operation Alpha that it probably useless speculate on chances at present time. It seems to me, however, in contrast many convincing apparent reasons against, there are at least 2 factors which might cause <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> go forward. Strangely enough these 2 factors have become accentuated as result of events which have followed signature Turk-Iraqi pact. It would be optimistic indeed to say that some good may yet come out of situation which has been locally one of deterioration. Yet there is just a chance, if we play our cards right, this could yet turn out to be the case.</p>
                        <p>1. The first of these is that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> is now aware that Egypt, or any grouping of states under leadership of Egypt, will not receive really effective backing and material support from the West, and particularly from the US, because of Arab-Israeli situation.</p>
                        <p>He sees that other states, more fortunate this respect in geographical locations of the North, can be enticed away from Israeli preoccupations (this probably not as true as he believes) and materially benefited by association with the West. He sees Egypt, geographically separated by Israel be [<hi rend="italic">from?</hi>] northern tier, beginning to fall in entirely different light as far as interest of the West is concerned. These feelings of frustration could, on the one hand, lead him to seek neutrality and general non-cooperation with the West. We would under these conditions be confronted with increasing resentment regarding combination of Israeli and West generally, as he would consider this combination basically responsible for box in which Egypt finds herself. On the other hand, these same feelings of frustration could conceivably lead to decision to correct Egypt’s <pb xml:id="pg_152" n="152" facs="0180"/>position by going ahead with Israeli settlement and turning far more openly to West for support. Influencing the choice between these 2 alternatives seems to be our greatest task in Egypt to date.</p>
                        <p>2. The 2nd of these factors, closely enmeshed with 1st, is an increased desire in Egypt to see line of communications reestablished between Egypt and other Arab States. There has been a growing realization that Egypt is in fact isolated by geography and that this will affect the importance of her role in Middle Eastern matters,</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Stevenson</persName> and I have discussed general problem several times. We believe that a corridor, or triangular arrangement such as embodied in Alpha, will not be accepted by Egypt. In my last discussion with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>
                            <note n="2" xml:id="d74fn2">See <ref target="#d67">Document 67</ref>.</note> we discussed Negev sufficiently for me to conclude he would think Alpha proposal extremely unrealistic. In conversation with <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Stevenson</persName> just prior his departure, <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> stated <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> wished US to work up specific proposal during his absence, but reiterated Egypt could not accept corridor and that whole of Negev south of Beersheba was only answer. <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Stevenson</persName> cautioned of course this extremely unrealistic. It occurs to me that Alpha proposal probably based primarily upon psychological and propaganda desirability of symbolic relinking Arab world. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>, however, is thinking in terms (which believe he over-emphasizes in practical importance) of actual effective land communication. When considered in this light Alpha proposals, due terrain and road considerations, are in fact unrealistic as study relief map shows.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Stevenson</persName> and I hope Department and Foreign Office will continue search for possible alternatives. In this connection, recall discussion with Haim [<hi rend="italic">Nahum?</hi>] Goldmann<note n="3" xml:id="d74fn3">Chairman of the Jewish Agency Executive and Chairman of the World Jewish Congress.</note> in Department some 2 years ago. He volunteered his feeling that a corridor type approach to Negev would be unworkable, and even if accepted, would merely set up ambush trap for future. He stated furthermore approach should be one of trying to get peoples to work together locally rather than drawing of new lines to keep them apart. His own view was that we should seek joint Egyptian-Israeli administration of entire Negev. I remember my surprise at suggestion and queried him as to whether he thought <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> would accept such a proposal. At that time he stated he believed there was such a possibility.</p>
                        <p>For obvious reasons would recommend that idea not be further developed with Goldmann. Nevertheless it seemed this might be of interest to Department and Foreign Office in exploring new possibilities. Egyptian position, as stated to <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Stevenson</persName> recently, is certain to be that Negev south of Beersheba should go to the Arab States. Our <pb xml:id="pg_153" n="153" facs="0181"/>guess is that they will hold to this position stubbornly unless we can find a better compromise position than present Alpha proposal.</p>
                        <p>In discussing Goldmann’s suggestion with <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Stevenson</persName> he made following points with which I concur:</p>
                        <p>(1) If such arrangement were possible it would as well solve problem of Gaza which is otherwise an awkward one.</p>
                        <p>(2) Joint Israeli-Jordanian administration would probably be more feasible than Israeli-Egyptian.</p>
                        <p>(3) Some type of minimum international supervision probably would be required, at least initially.</p>
                        <p>Returning to objective Alpha itself, it will be recognized this message does not attempt deal with internal problems which will affect chances for Alpha. Some of these are grave and could well assume such proportions as to dwarf those foreign affairs considerations mentioned herein which give some reason for hope.</p>
                        <p>Department of course realizes if coming talks go well day will come when net advantages to Egypt and Arab world generally will have to be placed in very specific terms. The cost will not be light as there are few apparent advantages for Arabs in Alpha proposals themselves. We assume here Department fully aware Arab-Israeli settlement, if possible at all, will be costly but believes as we do that net advantages fully justify such expenditure.</p>

Our investigation indicated basis for settlement exists although settlement will not be wholly acceptable to either side. Summing up Secretary said security treaty must guarantee stability and not war; settlement of major issues not unobtainable; and we must decide now on procedure and timing. Although Israel might think plans too ambitious progress of kind indicated necessary to get type of treaty Israel wanted. Otherwise some interim device such as renewed and possibly strengthened Tripartite Declaration would have to suffice.</p>
                        <p>Secretary stated he felt approach should be made on substantially simultaneous basis to Israel and Arab states. Among latter US thinking of approaching Egypt first. Gaza incident and <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s trip to Bandung had upset time-table. Secretary added that Israel might have ideas on tactics. He hoped that shortly after <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> returned from Bandung presupposing quiet along border we could make up our minds definitely whether to approach Egypt.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> stated Secretary’s remarks opened new vistas. His Government also felt Egypt offered best opportunity. Fundamental point was whether assurances regarding Israel’s security would have to wait settlement with Arabs. He urged that present agreed frontiers be guaranteed. Regarding procedures <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> thought <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>’s method <pb xml:id="pg_155" n="155" facs="0183"/>proved effective on water question and could perhaps be used again.</p>
                        <p>In reply to any additional inquiries from <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> Embassy Tel Aviv should state further elaboration of US thinking at this time not possible. Essential point is restore calm on frontiers and establish suitable atmosphere for progress.</p>
                        <p>Department informed British Embassy April 14 of above conversation.</p>

Israel agrees Egypt may yet be key which would unlock door leading to progress. From viewpoint talks here can think nothing more disastrous than having some newspaper story touch off a wave of discussion on subject of United States intention and/or plan bring about peace settlement. As we agreed upon utmost secrecy and particularly as I assured him (allowed I believe by Alpha instructions) he could proceed with assurance Israel would not know of talks until we saw whether progress was possible here. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> would interpret such a <pb xml:id="pg_156" n="156" facs="0184"/>story as our breaking faith with him.

                        <p>DEAR MR. SECRETARY: In the absence of H.M. Ambassador<note n="2" xml:id="d77fn2">Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger M. Makins.</persName>
                            </note> I am writing to you on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>’s instructions to say that he considers it would be very valuable if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Francis Russell</persName> could visit London for further talks on the Middle East problem.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> believes that we should try to persuade Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> that the territorial concessions demanded of Israel under existing Alpha planning are sufficient (combined with such “outside inducements” as can be offered to Egypt) to justify an attempt to reach a settlement on these lines. From Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s reactions to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName>’s approach it looks very probable however that he will reject the proposal for a land link between Egypt and Jordan and will insist on a larger concession in the Negev as a price for his cooperation. Her Majesty’s Government would like to agree in advance with the United States Government what to do in such circumstances.</p>
                        <p>A further matter of concern to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> arises from the solution we have had in mind in respect of the Gaza Strip. Since the plan was drawn up, this area has become the most dangerous of all and the refugee population in its present state of excitement would constitute a standing threat to any settlement. This is another matter which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> might discuss in London.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_157" n="157" facs="0185"/>
                        <p>In view of the urgency, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> would be glad to know whether it would be possible for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> to proceed within a few days to London so that the further examination could be completed during the next two weeks.<note n="3" xml:id="d77fn3"> On April 18, <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> transmitted this letter to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> as an attachment to a memorandum recommending acceptance of the British proposal of consultations. <persName>Dulles</persName> approved the recommendation.

                        <p>887. British Ambassador<note n="2" xml:id="d78fn2">John Walter Nicholls.</note> and I met this morning with General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> to exchange views regarding the Egyptian-Israel situation relative to the Security Council’s second resolution and to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>’s proposal. The consensus which <persName>Burns</persName> is transmitting to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Secretary General and which Nicholls and I undertook to transmit to our governments follows:</p>
                        <p>1. First priority should be given to obtaining from Egyptians a firm commitment regarding their willingness to participate in high level talks in meetings which would be held under General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName>’ auspices.</p>
                        <p>2. Re problem of agenda it is suggested that this be defined as discussion of General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName>’ proposals in pursuance Security Council resolution and any other proposals for the reduction of tensions on the border which in the opinion of the two parties should be discussed.</p>
                        <p>3. Re level of representation it is suggested that the Egyptians be informed that the Israel Government expects to be represented by <pb xml:id="pg_158" n="158" facs="0186"/>the Director General of the Foreign Ministry<note n="3" xml:id="d78fn3">Walter Eytan.</note> that presumably he would be accompanied by the <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> Chief of Staff.<note n="4" xml:id="d78fn4">Moshe Dayan.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. Although it was recognized that the <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss> might take the position that not one of General Bums’ proposals should be resolved until a general meeting is held, the proposal for joint patrols in view of its importance at this moment, should immediately be pressed as vigorously as possible by <persName>Burns</persName> with his regular <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss> contacts with US and United Kingdom diplomatic support.</p>
                        <p>It appeared to us in today’s discussion that in order for Security Council to act intelligently on the Israel complaint to that body (Department telegram 596<note n="5" xml:id="d78fn5">The Department informed the Embassy in Tel Aviv in telegram 596, April 11, that earlier in the day Israeli Embassy representatives had requested U.S. support for an urgent Security Council meeting to continue consideration of Israel’s complaint against Egypt, had urged U.S. backing for Israel’s contention that Egypt was responsible for the current situation along the frontier, and inquired as to the U.S. attitude toward <persName>Burns</persName>’ efforts to initiate high-level Israeli-Egyptian discussions. The Americans responded that the Department fully supported <persName>Burns</persName>’ efforts and that it thought a Security Council meeting would prejudice prospects for their success. (Department of State, Central Files, 674.84A/4–1155)</note>) it was necessary to know before hand whether in fact the Egyptian Government was prepared to participate in high level meetings along the lines set forth above.</p>
                        <p>As preamble to discussions which led to foregoing suggestions General Bums gave us the following appraisal situation. Majority incidents since February 28 Gaza action have been chargeable to Egypt. As these were largely sins of omission rather than commission he assumed that any Security Council decision on Israel complaint would be somewhat milder than <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> condemnation of Israel for February 28 incident.</p>
                        <p>He appraised attitudes two parties as result preliminary discussions as follows:</p>
                        <p>a. Joint patrols—Egypt favorable. Israel rather strongly opposed but has not closed door.</p>
                        <p>b. Barricades along demarcation line—Israel desires but Egypt somewhat opposes.</p>
                        <p>c. Both sides agreeable to use trained soldiers only in area one kilo each side demarcation line.</p>
                        <p>d. No insurmountable obstacles to eventual local commanders agreement.</p>
                        <p>As we were leaving, <persName>Burns</persName> said that accompanied by Chief of Staff Dayan, he was visiting this weekend a number of the Israel border settlements near the Gaza strip.</p>

                        <p>DEAR MR. PRIME MINISTER: I have received, through your Ambassador in Washington, the text of your letter to me of April 12, 1955.<note n="2" xml:id="d79fn2">See <ref target="#d73">Document 73</ref>.</note> Your statement of the problems which the present situation in the Middle East presents for Israel is most helpful, and I welcome the clear and constructive manner in which you have presented your Government’s point of view.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> will have advised you that I discussed with him in some detail the points raised in your communication and let him know the direction which my thinking has been taking in dealing with the problems of peace and security in the area.</p>
                        <p>I am particularly pleased by your reference to the question of the division of the waters of the Jordan valley. We believe the Jordan Development Plan should stand on its own merits and not be dependent on other solutions, but if this question could be resolved, we would all be encouraged to hope that a broader settlement of outstanding issues might be possible.</p>
                        <p>I feel I should let you know quite frankly our difficulties with regard to the security arrangement which you suggest. Up to the present time, the United States has not entered into any security treaty, except in the Western Hemisphere, unless the treaty was directed against the expansionist threat of international communism. We have steadfastly avoided involvement in regional controversies. For instance, we insisted that the Manila Pact stipulate that the “aggression and armed attack” referred to in that Pact should apply only to “communist aggression”. A security treaty with Israel would require the consent of the Senate. If we presented to the Senate a treaty with Israel today, many Senators would feel that they were not being asked to guarantee stability but, rather, to guarantee United States involvement in a highly inflammatory dispute. In order to obtain the Senate’s consent, I feel confident that the major issues between Israel and her neighbors would have to be brought measurably nearer solution.</p>
                        <p>I have been giving the matter serious study for the past few months, and have come out with the following basic conclusions:</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_160" n="160" facs="0188"/>
                        <p>1. No formal treaty guarantee of Israel or her neighbors would meet with the approval of the United States Senate or the American people unless there were a reasonable chance of stability in the area. This would require substantial progress toward a settlement of the major outstanding issues.</p>
                        <p>2. In our view, such a settlement is not unobtainable.</p>
                        <p>3. The United States Government is ready to exert every effort to achieve such a settlement and is giving earnest thought to the questions of procedure and timing.</p>
                        <p>I am confident you will agree that a favorable outcome of our endeavor could be jeopardized by any public intimation of our efforts at this time. Success will also depend, of course, on the maintenance of an atmosphere of tranquility in the area during the crucial period ahead.</p>
                        <p>I shall be glad to receive further thoughts from you at any time, by letter or through your Ambassador here.</p>
                        <p>With every good wish and my heartiest personal greetings, I remain.</p>
                        <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

Secretary’s remarks designed to convince <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss> it can obtain security guarantee if it will cooperate in maintaining calm in area and work toward settlement of some of basic Israel-Arab issues.</p>
                        <p>It should be noted Secretary did not mention US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> discussions nor existence of Alpha plans.

We have informed <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss> of essentiality of Israel abstaining from initiating any publicity about discussions and jeopardy to possible security guarantee which would result from it.</p>

                        <p>904. When I called on the Prime Minister yesterday he said “You find me in a very discouraged mood” referring to the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> decision in meeting April 11 [<hi rend="italic">19</hi>] to postpone Israel complaint against Egypt. He said effect throughout Israel certain to be bad with press and public speakers stressing severe unfavorable attitude toward <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> failure to act was a “manifest instance of partiality” and “will encourage further acts of hostility against Israel”. “What are we supposed to do?” he asked. “Egypt takes these actions against us and we are told not to shoot but refer matter to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> condemns Egypt which continues actions and we refer matter to the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> which takes no action against Egypt.” “What can one expect the public of Israel to think?” In reply to my question as to his idea of the reasons for the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> failure to act he said he could only surmise that “they were afraid a condemnation of Egypt might jeopardize the plan for high-level talks.” Called his attention to fact that the subject could be raised again but he countered with question of whether I expected Israel would ask for reopening of matter and again receive slap in the face.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> also raised subject of <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> report on shooting of American (Jerusalem’s 291 on Department<note n="2" xml:id="d82fn2">Not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 285.1113 Harris, <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Charles B.</persName>/4–1855)</note>) and Chairman’s failure to specifically identify killer. This could only be interpreted as fear of displeasing Jordan and thus must be regarded as prejudice. This had already aroused ire of Israel press and he regretted attacks on “an American military officer” but it reflected attitude of public toward <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>’s action.</p>
                        <p>I gathered from his postponement of my original morning appointment and other comment that he had been closeted with <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> and others of [garble—Cabinet?] all morning for discussion of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> matter and government policy in light of that disappointment; the issuance of a public statement on the matter to be released at once;<note n="3" xml:id="d82fn3">See <ref target="#d83fn2">footnote 2</ref>, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>.</note> the proposed high-level meeting with Egypt and General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> as outlined in latter’s letter to Prime Minister (Jerusalem’s 261<note n="4" xml:id="d82fn4">Not printed.

                        <p>Regarding high-level meeting he volunteered information that he was accepting the <persName>Burns</persName> proposal (Jerusalem’s 262<note n="5" xml:id="d82fn5">See <ref target="#d63fn2">footnote 2, Document 63</ref>.</note>) but wanted to make it clear that proposal for high-level meeting he made originally (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 858<note n="6" xml:id="d82fn6">
                                <ref target="#d65">Document 65</ref>.</note>) had now been “superseded by the <persName>Burns</persName> proposal” and there would be only one program of high-level talks and not two. When I enquired as to his thinking as to the level of the talks he said <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> was willing to have them at ministerial level or even at “just below ministerial level” (meaning Secretary General of Foreign Office I believe). He remarked that if Egypt insisted on lesser level he would be very displeased with idea. I feel that the Prime Minister would not be surprised if Egypt would find itself with no one in the high-level categories with authority to participate in such talks in absence of <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SSMSM1">Salem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> but he indicated willingness <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> proceed without delay. He said letter accepting <persName>Burns</persName> proposal had been drafted but he gave no details of content.</p>
                        <p>When I enquired whether it was correct to assume that the discussions were to be limited strictly to the improvement of the situation in the border area and he agreed that the meetings were to be held under the auspices of General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName>, he said the first assumption was correct but he had not given the second point definite thought. However he “felt that point could be worked out”. I then told him that “it is the view of the US Government that the discussions should be under the chairmanship of General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName>; should be limited to the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution of March 30; and that such discussions have obvious priority over other possible negotiations.”</p>

                        <p>DEAR HANK: As you know, I have been in London the past week resuming the discussions on Alpha with <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Evelyn Shuckburgh</persName> and his colleagues at the Foreign Office.<note n="2" xml:id="d84fn2">Discussions among <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName>, representatives of the U.S. Embassy, and officers of the Foreign Office were held April 25–29. British officials prepared summary minutes of these meetings; documents are <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> London Talks, late April 1955: Minutes of Meetings held A/25–4/29, incl.</note> The enclosed copies of our agreed minutes will indicate to you the direction our talks have taken. The parts which will be of most interest to you are those dealing with the Negev and with the line to be taken when an opportunity offers to follow up the discussions which you and <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Stevenson</persName> had with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> before he left for Bandung. None of the specific suggestions, of course, have been reviewed or approved by the Secretary but it is my opinion that they are in accordance with the general views he has expressed. I will take them up with him when I return and give you any further thoughts that may result. In the meantime, I think that, if you concur and as you have the occasion, you would be safe in proceeding along the lines suggested in the enclosures.</p>
                        <p>I intend, when I get back to Washington, to suggest to the Secretary that the time will come within the next few weeks to broaden the base of Alpha within the American Government. The British are somewhat further advanced in this. They have referred the parts relating to a compensation scheme to their Treasury. A summary of Alpha has been circulated to the Cabinet members. In Washington, the Under Secretary and the Secretary have kept fully abreast of the discussions and developments and the Secretary informed the President in very general terms. We are, however, reaching a point where a delicate balance must be maintained between the considerations of secrecy, which you have well stressed, and the need of making sure that the Pentagon, the Bureau of the Budget and the National Security Council will give the various elements of Alpha their support. The best time for raising Alpha with them, I should think, would be after you obtain any hope of cooperation from <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> and before we approach the Israelis.</p>
                        <p>I gather from the telegrams from Cairo that you and <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Stevenson</persName> have been working closely and that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> must have the impression <pb xml:id="pg_167" n="167" facs="0195"/>that the US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> are coordinating their views. I assume therefore that it will be best to leave it to you and <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Stevenson</persName> to decide between you the role that each will play in getting our ideas across to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>.</p>
                        <p>We do not minimize the difficulty of your task but our hopes at the moment are slightly higher than they were a month ago.</p>
                        <p>With all best wishes,</p>

                        <pb xml:id="pg_168" n="168" facs="0196"/>
                        <p>(3) Referring <hi rend="italic">Jerusalem Post</hi> reasoning against joint patrols, <persName>Burns</persName> expressed opinion that if joint patrols had been established following discussions begun last December incidents, which Israeli complained to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> on April 4, would not have occurred. He points out that Israeli patrols adjacent <gloss target="#t_DL1">DL</gloss> are peculiarly vulnerable. Such patrols further back would be less exposed and more effective; while joint patrols would show those evilly-disposed toward Israel that Egypt cooperating preventing violations. On the contrary, Israel’s refusal accept joint patrols plus continuance Israel patrols along <gloss target="#t_DL1">DL</gloss> possibly indicative Israeli refusal cooperate efforts relieve tensions, prevent further incidents.</p>
                        <p>(4) Argument that joint patrols infringe sovereignty is unrealistic since for all practical purposes patrols would be moving along the <gloss target="#t_DL1">DL</gloss> and would not infringe territorial rights.</p>
                        <p>(5) Finally, statements in newspaper believed to carry official views to effect Egyptians acting in bad faith respecting measures they have accepted may well endanger possibility arranging the “high level conference” which Israel professes to desire; since Israel’s refusals consider one of the proposals which Egypt has accepted may result in latter’s withdrawal of her agreement to the other proposals. This would destroy basis for holding conference.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Verbatim text is as follows:</p>
                        <p>“Dear Mr. Secretary, Your prompt and friendly reply to my message was deeply appreciated. The terms of your letter and of your oral explanations to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> have received our most careful consideration.</p>
                        <p>My Government was profoundly impressed by your statement to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> that you accept the principle of a security treaty with Israel and that the crux of your program is to create conditions to make that possible. To Israel with its grave security problem this comes as a most constructive and encouraging departure.</p>
                        <p>The difficulties indicated by you as lying in the way of such an association between the United States of America and Israel are well understood by us. Yet on closer examination not only do they not appear insuperable but of themselves would seem to constitute a reason for hastening its achievement.</p>
                        <p>Israel is already faced with a series of developments within the region which have seriously upset the balance to her detriment. I allude, first, to the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, which has resulted in a major access of military and geo-political strength to Egypt whilst denying to Israel the benefit of its protection; secondly, to the Military Aid Agreement between the United States of America and Iraq, a country avowedly and violently hostile to Israel occupying a pivotal position in the anti-Israel-Arab front; and finally to their Iraqi-Turkish pact sponsored by the United States of America now impressively strengthened by Britain’s adherence, which again singles out Israel for exclusion and which otherwise carries within it <pb xml:id="pg_171" n="171" facs="0199"/>definite anti-Israel implications. For all these far-reaching departures, adversely and cumulatively affecting Israel’s security, no compensatory measure of assistance to Israel has been offered. Israel was the first state in the Middle East to seek American military aid. Its application, dated February 1952, has remained unanswered.<note n="5" xml:id="d87fn5">For documentation regarding Israel’s attempt to obtain U.S. military aid in February 1952, see <ref target="frus1952-54v09p1">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1952–1954, vol. IX, Part 1</ref>, pp. 894 ff.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus our discussion proceeds against the background of a security situation thrown markedly out of balance against Israel and aggravating the state of siege to which she is anyhow subjected by her neighbours. This disequilibrium, which may be only the beginning of a process, seems to us a compelling argument for an immediate measure of redress in Israel’s favour.</p>
                        <p>The obstacles you envisage to the conclusion of a security treaty with Israel are twofold:</p>
                        <p>(a) The deviation it implies from the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> line of not involving itself in intra-regional conflicts and concentrating solely on anti-Communist defense;</p>
                        <p>(b) The probable reluctance of the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> Senate to sanction a security commitment so long as the present unsettled situation within the Middle East continues. Your conclusion is that substantial progress must be achieved towards the settlement of major issues outstanding between us and the Arab States before such a security treaty can be submitted for the Senate’s approval.</p>
                        <p>On the first count it seems to me that the handicaps today in the effective organization of the Middle East for anti-Soviet defense are on the one hand the inhibitions which prevent certain Arab States from adopting a pro-western orientation; and on the other the ever smouldering Arab-Israel conflict threatening to erupt into conflagration if the Arab States should come to regard Israel as hopelessly isolated and forsaken, while Israel for her part were forced into a mood of desperation.</p>
                        <p>A security treaty with Israel would go a long way towards meeting these issues. By proving conclusively that the US is determined not to leave Israel in the lurch, but on the contrary, to make the most of Israel’s association, the treaty would give Israel a sense of poise and stability. It would at the same time promote a more realistic spirit within the Arab States and bring them nearer to peace. It would also make the reluctant Arab States eager to secure for themselves the advantage accruing from an association with the US which would have come within the grasp of Israel. It would thus be a skillful throw, killing two, or even three birds with one stone. Moreover, for us in Israel, and we think for many people outside, it is hardly conceivable that the region can be effectively mobilized for <pb xml:id="pg_172" n="172" facs="0200"/>resistance to a possible Soviet aggression or subversive penetration without the participation of the one state within it to whom democracy and spiritual liberty are the very breath of existence and whose military and industrial potential is patent.</p>
                        <p>The second consideration, with all its cogency, is liable to produce deadlock. The root of the trouble is not the insolubility of the problems at issue between us and the Arab States, but the deliberate refusal of their leaders to tackle them. That refusal is only likely to harden still further once they realize that by proposing any compromise they can prevent Israel from getting a security treaty with the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>. This result will be bad enough, but if the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> goes further and proceeds to indicate the specific lines along which a settlement is to be sought, a worse complication is bound to arise.</p>
                        <p>You said to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> on the 13 April<note n="6" xml:id="d87fn6">See <ref target="#d75">Document 75</ref>.</note> that when the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> Government comes out with its proposals for a settlement, Israel will probably not like some of them and the Arabs will not like some others. I must admit that this prediction has filled our hearts with an anxiety not less serious than the one you are so earnestly endeavoring to allay. We are prepared to accept the status quo whereas the Arabs are out to change it to our undoing. We do not claim their territory. They claim ours. We do not ask that Jewish refugees from Arab lands be repatriated. They insist on the return to Israel of Arabs who fled. In these circumstances, what they will not like is their failure to get what they do not possess, whereas what we shall not like is to give up what is ours.</p>
                        <p>Should proposals of this nature be presented, the following results will ensue. Israel will have no alternative but to reject them. The Arab States will regard them as a premium upon their intransigence in which they will persist hoping to extract larger concessions.</p>
                        <p>To sum up this part of my argument, if the treaty is made contingent upon a prior settlement, there will be no treaty; and if the settlement is predicated upon one-sided concessions, there will be no settlement. A double vicious circle may well be created. I am certain that our desire is to avoid such a political impasse and it is to the same end that my present observations are directed.</p>
                        <p>In all earnestness I would appeal to you to give further urgent thought to the crucial question of whether the conclusion of a defense treaty should be deferred till after tangible progress towards a settlement has been achieved or whether it should not rather be proceeded with at once and itself pave the way for such progress, I am encouraged to press this view in the light of your own statement to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> that you envisage a program leading to the <pb xml:id="pg_173" n="173" facs="0201"/>conclusion of a treaty within the current year and that you do not intend to make it dependent on unattainable conditions.</p>
                        <p>In this context I would be failing in my duty of candour towards you if I did not make it clear beyond any possibility of misunderstanding that there can be no question for us of cession of territory or the return of Arab refugees. The United Nations compromise of 1947 was annulled by Arab aggression which deserves no reward. Any reversion in that direction is now political and physical impossibility. This does not of course exclude the technical demarcation of the frontiers at a peace settlement which may entail minor and mutual adjustments nor the continued application for the benefit of Arab refugees of the reunion of families scheme.</p>
                        <p>All this does not mean either that we envisage a rigid continuation of the present deadlock till suddenly peace comes about at the waving of a magic wand, or that we are prepared to contemplate with equanimity a further deterioration of border security regardless of its ultimate consequences.</p>
                        <p>Nothing is farther from our thoughts and on the contrary, we do believe that gradual progress towards a settlement such as would result in some interim modus vivendi, is indeed possible. On the question of the Jordan waters I can only reiterate the hope that an agreed solution may well be within our reach and as regards border security, given a firm resolve on the Arab side to check disorders, a great deal can be done to prevent armed attacks and incursions and reduce the incidence of marauding to a tolerable minimum. For our part, and without committing ourselves in advance to the endorsement of every and any proposal, we shall be only too eager to collaborate with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and the Arab States concerned in the implementation of this program. Furthermore, we would be ready to proceed to the payment of compensation for refugee lands—necessitating possibly a special loan to us, repayable over a period of years—provided Egypt lifted the Suez Canal blockade and the Arab States discontinued their threats and reprisals against foreign firms, aviation companies, etc., operating in Israel. Finally, we offer cooperation with the Arab Governments in the mutual checking of hostile propaganda and in the adoption of other concerted measures aiming at the reduction of tension.</p>
                        <p>For the attainment of these objectives we should welcome the assistance of the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>, just as we have welcomed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>’s mission. Such assistance, to be successful, need not be accompanied by the formulation of definite proposals for a peace settlement, either complete or partial. Indeed, for reasons explained, the prior enunciation by the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> or by any other third power, of specific terms is liable to wreck the chances of a settlement. We feel convinced, for instance, that the attempt to prejudge the outcome of <pb xml:id="pg_174" n="174" facs="0202"/>the water negotiations by the prior formulation of the main report added needlessly to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>’s difficulties which he subsequently managed partly to overcome only by dint of high skill and unlimited patience. In the case of such decisive problems as territory and population, the setting forth by a third party of concrete terms in advance may lead to fatal results and should at all costs be avoided.</p>
                        <p>If the approach here outlined commends itself to your judgment, I would suggest that discussions be initiated without delay concerning the exact scope and terms of a Security Treaty. At the same time soundings might be undertaken with regard to the possible discontinuance of Arab economic warfare against Israel’s readiness to take in hand the payment of compensation in respect of Arab lands abandoned.</p>
                        <p>I should be grateful for an early intimation of your reaction to the views expressed in this letter.</p>
                        <p>I assume that these lines will reach you on the eve of your departure for Europe and I take this opportunity of again wishing you the fullest measure of success in your efforts for the sake of peace and freedom.</p>

                        <p>Present Status of Efforts to Secure Israel-Arab Settlement</p>
                        <p>Following the informal discussions between the Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> in Paris last November, <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Evelyn Shuckburgh</persName>, who is Under Secretary for Middle Eastern Affairs in the British Foreign Office, came here for two weeks in January. I went to London for two weeks in February and again last week. As a result of these discussions and the background work done by the Near East offices in the Department and the Foreign Office, agreement has been reached between the Department and the Foreign Office on the elements of what it is believed would constitute an equitable settlement of the major issues between Israel and her Arab neighbors, such as borders, refugee resettlement and compensation, Jerusalem, economic relations and political relations, Gaza, and Egyptian rights <pb xml:id="pg_176" n="176" facs="0204"/>of transit across the Negev. The plan assumes the success of the Jordan Valley Development Plan.</p>
                        <p>Agreement has also been reached on the best ways of securing Arab and Israel agreement. Discussions to sound out Egyptian cooperation will probably take place between Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> next week. If they are successful, approaches would then be made to Jordan and Israel. If <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> will not cooperate, alternative approaches have been agreed upon.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_ONE1">One</gloss> of the assumptions has been that a requisite element in any settlement would be a guarantee by the U.S. and the U.K. of the border between Israel and the neighboring Arab states, and a draft of a treaty has been worked out and agreed upon.</p>
                        <p>It is also assumed that the larger part of the funds necessary to compensate the Arab refugees would have to be provided by the U.S. and the U.K., and that substantial economic and military assistance to the cooperating countries would have to be contemplated. (See attached memo of February 14—Tab A.<note n="3" xml:id="d88fn3">See <ref target="#d18fn2">footnote 2, Document 18</ref>.</note>) The above proposals have been approved by Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> and Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>. In the U.S. Government, the plans have been discussed as they developed with <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">George Allen</persName> and other officers in the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, with you, and with the Secretary. On February 15 the Secretary discussed the plans briefly with the President.

                        </list>
                        <p>You will recall that at the meeting in his office the other afternoon,<note n="2" xml:id="d89fn2">See <ref target="#d86fn2">footnote 2, Document 86</ref>.</note> the Secretary disapproved the suggestion of two northern <pb xml:id="pg_177" n="177" facs="0205"/>triangles in the Negev as a basis for meeting <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s desire for contact with Jordan. The British Embassy has just handed me the attached statement of the Foreign Office’s views on the northern triangle proposal.</p>
                        <p>If the Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> do have a chance to discuss Alpha in Paris, I believe it will be useful for them to exchange views on this point.</p>

                        <p>Following is substance of a telegram from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> to Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger Makins</persName> dated May 4, 1955.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Office explain that the northern triangle proposal is not designed to improve Egypt’s military situation (though the larger triangles would presumably be easier to defend) nor to provide better transit rights for civilian traffic. From the Egyptian point of view its main advantages over the southern triangle proposal would be :</p>
                        <p>(a) it is based on the 1947 partition line on which the Arabs take their stand. This makes a good sales point;</p>
                        <p>(b) it involves a fairly large cession of territory by Israel. This, together with (a) above would make it easier for <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> to defend to his own people and the other Arab States;</p>
                        <p>(c) it joins the Gaza strip as well as Egypt to the rest of the eastern Arab world and might thus help to ease the pressure of the refugees there by giving them eventually the opportunity to disperse eastwards;</p>
                        <p>(d) it is served by a road across Sinai which already exists.</p>
                        <p>2. The plan avoids taking from Israel any of the irrigable land or known mineral deposits in the Negev and leaves them in full control of the port of Elath and its hinterland. If this solution were adopted the concessions demanded of Israel in the area south of Hebron and in the demilitarized zone of Ein Gev could be reduced.</p>
                        <p>3. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> will be happy to discuss the northern triangle proposal on the lines above with Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> next week if time can be found. He is glad to see that Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> has not ruled out the possibility of using it with Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> at a later stage. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> agrees that it would be very difficult to sell to the Israelis; but it may be found that something like it is <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s minimum price for settlement.</p>

                        <p>4. Meanwhile Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> is instructing Her Majesty’s Ambassador in Cairo not to put the proposal to Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> for the present.</p>

However, <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> is afraid that once <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> starts his conversations, we may as a practical matter be committed so deeply that the President’s approval becomes academic. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName>, therefore, thought it would be wise if you took this matter up with the President today.<note n="2" xml:id="d91fn2">According to the Secretary’s memorandum of conversation with the President on May 6, <persName>Dulles</persName> said the following to <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> regarding Alpha:<p>“I discussed with the President the ‘Alpha’ project for the Near East. I recalled our previous talk and the fact that matters had progressed to a point where it was deemed useful to have <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> talk to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>. I did not want to take this further step without clearing it with the President. I mentioned that I thought it would be indispensable within the next few months to come out with some project which would indicate reasonable conditions under which we might be prepared with the British to give a guarantee of Israel against her neighbors and vice versa. I mentioned that this project had rather heavy financial implications and might involve ‘jumping up’ our contribution to the area by another $500,000,000 or thereabouts over a five-year period, or a total for the five years of around $1,000,000,000. The President indicated he thought it was in order for <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> to speak to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> on the assumption, of course, that he would skillfully avoid anything like a definitive commitment.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>)</p>
                                <p>Subsequent to this meeting, <persName>Dulles</persName> evidently made the following marginal inscription on the source text: “Pres. says go ahead. But no firm commitment”.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> opened the conversation by stating that he felt that good progress was being made in the negotiations with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Eric Johnston</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> hoped that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> could now secure Arab agreement in his forthcoming trip to the area.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador referred to the letter of May 4, sent by Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> to the Secretary.<note n="2" xml:id="d92fn2">See <ref target="#d87">Document 87</ref>.</note> The letter could be summarized briefly in that Israel wished a formal security association with the United States and also was willing to cooperate in measures to relieve tensions in the area. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>’ letter of April 16<note n="3" xml:id="d92fn3">
                                <ref target="#d79">Document 79</ref>.</note> had appeared to link these two matters. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> had replied that while Israel was interested in both subjects, she did not feel that one should be made conditional on the other. This could well stimulate Arab intransigence toward a settlement with Israel. There was a further logical defect. The United States regarded a security guarantee as a sequel to the relief of tensions, Israel regarded it as a means to such relief. Therefore Israel would like a guarantee first, and action towards a settlement of some of the outstanding issues with the Arabs second. Israel understood the U.S. position on the matter, however, and was willing to work simultaneously on both.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> expressed appreciation for this clarification since he had not understood this new point in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>’s letter. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> replied that the letter had been hurriedly drafted so that the Secretary would have an opportunity to study it before proceeding to Europe and meeting with the British Foreign Secretary. Israel stood by her position that a security treaty should come first but was willing to discuss both this and measures to reduce tension simultaneously.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_181" n="181" facs="0209"/>
                        <p>The Ambassador continued that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>’s letter had defined rather precisely Israel’s views regarding measures to reduce tension. Israel felt that the best point to start on would be payment of compensation to Arab refugees by Israel in return for a lifting of the secondary boycott and the Suez blockade by the Arabs. These were not the most delicate of the issues outstanding, and consequently afforded a good place to begin. The relatively quick beneficial effect which the implementation of such measures would have on the refugee problem was also of importance.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said that since the Secretary had mentioned border adjustments and the refugee problem, the Prime Minister had reiterated Israel’s position that there could be no sizeable cessions of Israel territory or return of refugees. This did not, however, preclude a willingness to consider minor and mutual adjustments as well as the continuation of the plan for the reunion of refugee families. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> wished to emphasize the word “mutual” in his reference to border adjustments. Israel was not morally bound to cede territory to the Arabs. She could, however, participate in a process of exchange even if this should mean that the Arabs might end up as a net beneficiary. The abortive attempt to make adjustments in the Latrun area was an example of what might be done.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> concluded by stating that he felt Israel’s position on this matter was not far from that of the U.S. in substance and that the difference could be bridged in practice.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> said that the Secretary would be giving his reaction to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>’s letter upon his return. His own personal view was that progress on the Jordan River negotiations was the touchstone to progress on the other matters. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> replied that he felt good progress was being made on the Jordan question. He added that Israel was concerned lest there be possible divergencies of views between the U.S. and Israel regarding territorial adjustments or repatriations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> answered that the need for success on the Jordan River negotiations made us reticent on the other points at this time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> asked if the U.S. Government was working with the United Kingdom on these overall questions. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> replied that we were making every effort to keep in close touch with the British on this matter. This did not mean that our views would at all times be identical. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> pointed out that the Secretary had mentioned only substantial progress toward stabilization of the situation as a condition precedent to a U.S. security guarantee. In his recent speech before Parliament, Sir <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony Eden</persName> had talked of British willingness <pb xml:id="pg_182" n="182" facs="0210"/>to guarantee Arab-Israel “peace”.<note n="4" xml:id="d92fn4">On April 4; for text of his remarks, see <hi rend="italic">Parliamentary Debates,</hi> House of Commons, 5th Series, volume 539, columns 894–904.</note> Israel was concerned regarding this apparent difference in view and felt that the British might be taking a stand which was impractical and perfectionist. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> ventured the guess that the British, with their long tradition of practicality, would not be perfectionists on this matter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> asked if France was associated in this effort. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> replied that France had interests in the area and was associated in the Tripartite Declaration. We would try to work with the French in the most appropriate manner. The French position was clouded, however, by such factors as the special position which France felt she had in Syria and Lebanon, as well as France’s interests in North Africa. This would probably mean that liaison with the French on these questions would be slower than our contacts with the British.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> asked if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> would confirm the recent speech by Congressman Bentley<note n="5" xml:id="d92fn5">Alvin M. Bentley (R–Mich.), Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.</note> to the effect that the U.S. envisaged arms aid only to Iraq during <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956.<note n="6" xml:id="d92fn6">Not further identified.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> replied that a public statement of policy such as this could come only from the Secretary. He imagined that there would be further informal indications of the lack of present U.S. intention to grant arms aid to Israel or her immediate Arab neighbors. Perhaps a public statement by the Secretary should be made. However, it might have an undesirable effect on the Jordan Valley negotiations, and there might be other reasons against a formal declaration of policy at this moment. He felt that timing was an important factor in considering a public statement.</p>

                            <persName>Burns</persName> informed Egyptians Israelis had agreed to three of four “concrete proposals” but had refused discuss joint patrols except at “high-level talks”. In his proposed agenda, <persName>Burns</persName> said he as chairman would make sure no discussion took place thereunder unless agreed to by both sides.</p>
                        <p>Egyptians replied that under these circumstances they saw no need for high-level talks since Egypt had already accepted in principle <persName>Burns</persName>’ four points and negotiations to implement them could best be handled by Gohar. <persName>Burns</persName> pointed out Israelis unwilling discuss joint patrols at operational level and Shalev<note n="4" xml:id="d93fn4">Ariel Shalev of the Israeli Defense Force.</note> (Gohar’s opposite number) had no authority commit Israeli Government in negotiation on other points. <persName>Burns</persName> also stressed advantages Israeli Foreign Office participation talks since its views “more moderate” than those of War Department and <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss>. Egyptians appeared unconvinced but asked <persName>Burns</persName> summarize his points in writing.

                        <p>I told <persName>Burns</persName> that while we of course fully supported his efforts reduce border tension it would be extremely difficult in my opinion for Government of Egypt agree undertake at this time major move in direction of Israelis such as high-level talks would represent and pointed out Gohar was responsible authority this subject in Egyptian Government with direct access <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>. It seemed to me that care must be taken avoid concentration of efforts on high-level talks to such a point that Government of Egypt might renege on its promise cooperate with <persName>Burns</persName> on his four “concrete proposals”. <persName>Burns</persName> replied he was under instructions <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> press for direct talks but obviously this line could not be further developed usefully if Government of Egypt were categorically to refuse. In answer my question <persName>Burns</persName> noted that on Israeli side considerable importance is attached to direct talks. He recognized possibility Israeli refusal accept principle joint patrols was being used as bargaining point. He aware Egyptian <pb xml:id="pg_184" n="184" facs="0212"/>position re talks difficult but pointed out impending Israeli election would hardly contribute to modification Israeli position.</p>
                        <p>Press today gave very full coverage to <persName>Burns</persName> visit highlighting Egyptian willingness cooperate on four points with following reservations:</p>

                        <p>I said that I knew that <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> and British felt southern triangle would not be acceptable basis for <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> but I thought this was limit to which we could proceed in <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName>’s talks with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> which would probably take place in next week or so. I added that in first instance I did not think any plan we put forward would prove acceptable but at least we could see what <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s reaction is and in light thereof decide whether or not it would be desirable to do something re northern triangle.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> agreed with me and said <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had thought <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> might advance as personal suggestion northern triangle because of <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s comments to <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> last February in Cairo when <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had indicated no small corridor through the Negev would be acceptable solution. However in light of my presentation he agreed <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> should only broach southern triangle and we will keep northern triangle as possible card to be played later.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> then mentioned <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>’s latest note to me<note n="2" xml:id="d95fn2">See <ref target="#d87">Document 87</ref>.</note> and asked my reaction. I replied that I felt strongly that territorial guarantee was biggest carrot we had and that it would be folly to give this away until we had a general settlement agreed between Arabs and Israel. I explained that Arabs want protection against an expansionist Israel and Israel wants protection against Arab desire to push her into sea. Guarantee is therefore card to be played when there was general agreement on various aspects of Israel settlement which include water, Arab refugees, territorial adjustment, status of <pb xml:id="pg_186" n="186" facs="0214"/>Jerusalem, etc. I concluded by saying that when I replied to <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> I had in mind making it clear that we could not give guarantee in advance. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> heartily approved.</p>

                        <p>2) EmbOff saw Gohar today. Latter, who was relaxed and cheerful in sharp contrast to agitation he had shown May 7 (<gloss target="#t_mytel1">mytel</gloss> 1671<note n="4" xml:id="d96fn4">Not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 674.84A/5–955)</note>), said:</p>
                        <p>A) <persName>Burns</persName> had informed Govt of Egypt he under instructions <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> to arrange high level talks, as best means reduce border tensions in view lack of authority of Shalev (“my opposite number”) to commit his govt. <persName>Burns</persName> had stressed that Govt of Egypt acceptance direct talks between civilians (eg “Ambassadors”) would also strengthen hand of <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> and Israeli <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> in combating activist policies of <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> and <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss>. Egypt, Gohar commented, had no desire be used as “cat’s paw” in connection Israeli elections or intra mural quarrels.</p>
                        <p>B) Govt of Egypt had “unofficial but sure” information Israelis had deliberately instructed Shalev arrange failure negots between him and Gohar in order justify Israeli contention “high level talks” essential.</p>
                        <p>C) Govt of Egypt now preparing reply <persName>Burns</persName> letter (<gloss target="#t_mytel1">mytel</gloss> 1686). Reply will reaffirm desire cooperate on latter’s 4 “concrete proposals” but will categorically reject direct talks on political level.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_187" n="187" facs="0215"/>
                        <p>D) Govt of Egypt has no intention naming any one other than Gohar to talk with Israelis. (Gohar confirmed <persName>Burns</persName> had mentioned Riyad<note n="5" xml:id="d96fn5">General <persName corresp="#p_RGM1">Mahmoud Riad</persName>, Egyptian Ambassador in Syria.</note> as possible Egyptian representative. He described the suggestion as “ludicrous” in view Riyad’s current task in Syria.)</p>
                        <p>E) Israeli patrol attack from demilitarized zone of Al Auja on Egyptian position at 7 AM yesterday (during <persName>Burns</persName> visit) resulting in death two Egyptian soldiers when linked with Israeli refusal accept joint patrols proposal made clear Israeli bad faith. He would not be surprised if Israelis, having failed achieve direct talks, now launch new attacks against Egyptians. “If this happens, we will be ready for them.”</p>
                        <p>3) Govt of Egypt press coverage <persName>Burns</persName> visit continued extensive emphasizing Egyptian cooperation on 4 points and omitting any reference direct talks issue in obvious effort counteract Israeli attempt seek propaganda victory by playing up Egyptian refusal direct talks.</p>
                        <p>4) <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Categoric Govt of Egypt refusal “direct talks” firmly based on Govt of Egypt appraisal effect such talks on regimes internal stability and external objectives particularly <gloss target="#t_ESS1">ESS</gloss> pact. In view unlikelihood this position will be altered, it appears only chance implement <persName>Burns</persName> 4 “concrete proposals” is for Israelis prove good faith by agreeing negotiate with Gohar as responsible Govt of Egypt nominee for this purpose. In my opinion Israeli willingness to abandon “direct talks” in favor practical cooperation at operational level may be only alternative to discrediting of <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> efforts as “ineffective” and renewed border clashes of greater intensity.</p>
                        <p>In connection Israeli refusal accept joint patrols, it is of interest that <persName>Burns</persName> confirmed to me at our meeting May 9 reports which had reached Embassy from other sources that “provocative maneuvering of Israeli patrols close to the border” was major cause present border tension.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> gave me appointment his office.</p>
                        <p>In contrast previous encounters found <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> reserved and cautious. Although meeting lengthy, conversation was devoted almost entirely to irritations and complaints along lines paragraph 1 above reference telegram. Not all items above reference emerged but several others along same general line were added. Attempted take each case and get to bottom of matter. In most cases he not forthcoming but on some produced “specific evidence” involving alleged activities U.S. personnel. He several times attempted to dismiss entire matter which I refused to allow. Told him I could not allow unsubstantiated charges against U.S. Government or Embassy without being allowed opportunity to get at bottom of these accusations. We finally agreed that he would send Ali Sabri to me personally with any new charges that are reported against U.S. as soon as they came to his attention.</p>
                        <p>While <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> professed he himself did not believe many of these accusations, there no doubt he is extremely suspicious. Most obvious conclusion for this area would seem to be that he deliberately trying to put U.S. on defensive for some tactical purpose. Do not however believe this the case as <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> personally somewhat incapable such acting. Am more inclined believe he has gone through a period since his return of really fearing U.S. may be turning against him. His training and experience might lead him to conclude that it would be logical for U.S. to work against him personally whenever our policies do not coincide. There are indications that he concerned U.S. should not be allowed strengthen its present capabilities to penetrate his support for possible use against him. Last week he took steps to restrict army officer contacts with Americans. (These now noticeably easing.)</p>
                        <p>It will be interesting to see effect of our talk upon him. Only indication as yet is that press gave meeting great publicity.<note n="3" xml:id="d98fn3">

                            <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> announcement of attack against Egyptian position in Gaza area May 18, marking resumption <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss> policy of reprisals, represents a deliberate flouting of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution of March 28.

                                <ref target="#d99">Document 99</ref>.</note> I thought it would be well ascertain <persName>Burns</persName> present appraisal usefulness proposed high-level talks Israel and Egypt as well as his ideas regarding any steps which might be taken in atmosphere resulting most recent incidents and Egypt’s aversion high-level talks. <persName>Burns</persName> commented as follows:</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_193" n="193" facs="0221"/>
                        <p>(1) He had done his best to comply with <gloss target="#t_UNSYG1">UNSYG</gloss> instructions arrange talks. However, he thought respective governments might well accept judgment their Ambassadors in Cairo and refrain from further pressure bring about such talks at this time.</p>
                        <p>(2) Lacking a precise agenda with significant points (in addition to the four points of the March 30 <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution) <persName>Burns</persName> failed to perceive any especial need for such talks. He was thus somewhat at a loss to refute Egyptian thesis that there is no need for discussions above the Shalev–Gohar level.</p>
                        <p>(3) With regard to the mines which causing much of the trouble, <persName>Burns</persName> expressed relief that these were not planted by or at the instigation of any authority of the <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss>. However, <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> authorities have shown themselves unable to prevent this activity thus far. He has written to Gohar to ask what further measures may be taken to stop mine planting. He has also recommended that <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> revamp administrative set-up in Gaza strip. Present organization places control police and refugees under Governor while military force is responsible to Army Commander. <persName>Burns</persName> urges that unified command all elements be established enhance effective control situation.</p>
                        <p>(4) <persName>Burns</persName> suggested that powers might again urge upon Israelis futility their policy of retaliation. Gaza incursion of February 28 certainly did not improve the situation, and there appears no valid reason to expect future retaliation efforts would prove more successful. In addition, very serious results might follow owing existence large body refugees there toward whom <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and powers have considerable responsibilities.</p>

                        <p>986. In conversation with Prime Minister on other matters yesterday, he told me that the Cabinet earlier in day heard his full report on <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> water negotiations and every member was very much interested in every detail. Also at Cabinet meeting were Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>, Teddy Kollek, Weiner and Blass (the last named making some comment constructive as well as otherwise). The matter is being held under advisement and the Prime Minister could not at this moment say when a firm final decision would be upcoming. I gathered that he felt confident of a favorable decision but he was careful to make no comment in that direction. In response to my question as to what he thought the Arabs would do he said, “I don’t know, but they should grab it quickly—especially Jordan”.</p>

                                <ref target="#d100">Document 100</ref>.</note> I called late yesterday afternoon on Prime Minister in Jerusalem to which he had returned from weekend. He was obviously expecting me to deliver message of nature I gave orally to him on basis reference telegram. He received message seriously. In somewhat stern tone and speaking without notes he said he wished to reply as follows:</p>
                        <p>He desired to comment first on the final sentence our message which he said described as “sting in the tail of the message”. He <pb xml:id="pg_195" n="195" facs="0223"/>said that he emphatically rejected the suggestion that there was any jockeying for political advantages on the part of the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> and “speaking for the government I reject this suggestion most emphatically.”</p>
                        <p>As explained on many occasions, he said, “there is no systematic policy of retaliation—there are isolated acts which to Israel are unavoidable.” He said that the loss of three innocent young lives cannot occur without punishment.<note n="3" xml:id="d104fn3">Reference is to the death of three of four Israelis wounded by the explosion of a mine near Kisufim on May 17.</note> “I challenge the representative of any government to say that if such an outrage had occurred on its frontier no retaliatory action would have been taken,” he said. He then referred to the long period of time since US borders have been disturbed, implying that it would be difficult for US Government to visualize itself in same position, and appealed to US to put itself in Israel’s position.</p>
                        <p>He did not think it “easy to accuse <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> of deliberately flouting <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution March 28” at a time when, (a), the resolution seems to have “had no effect on <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss>” and (b), when the “<gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> itself did not keep faith with its own principles by refusing to condemn Egypt for outrages committed against Israel, to which outrages Israel did not retaliate but about which Israel complained to the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>.”</p>
                        <p>He then referred to a press announcement, reported, he said, to have some Department connection, to effect that the mines which caused the loss of life in this latest incident were old mines laid before recent admonitions to Egypt. He said, “this is not my information. It is true that Egypt had informed General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> some time ago that couple of old mines remained in the ground and he warned us, after which we discovered and disposed of them. But the mines in the last outrage were newly laid mines. Moreover, they were not primitive or handmade mines but regular military mines of British manufacture and undoubtedly from stocks of military supplies used by the Egyptian Army. I impute nothing to the British, of course.”</p>
                        <p>On the subject of “high level talks,” he directed attention to the fact that the initiative came from the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, “and was then taken over by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.” He said, “we responded immediately, accepting the entire agenda as outlined by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Chief of Staff.<note n="4" xml:id="d104fn4">Major General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">E.L.M. Burns</persName>.</note> We note with concern, to this day Egypt’s reply is still outstanding—and we have been hearing for quite a time from <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> circles that there is no likelihood of a favorable reply. In meantime, General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> initiated talks at a routine level. Here again, the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> responded and we do not think we can be properly blamed for not accepting every single <pb xml:id="pg_196" n="196" facs="0224"/>suggestion, made in perfectly good faith by General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName>. Any country enters a conference on the understanding that it is free to use its judgment as to the efficacy and usefulness of the matter proposed. The fact that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> accepted three of the four proposals whereas Egypt accepted with reservations all four, does not leave us, in the balance, in an unfavorable position or lay the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> open to the charge of non-cooperation with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> has referred to Egypt’s reservations, however we are aware that they flatly rejected some of the proposals, such as telephone communication between local commanders without which any local commanders agreement is likely to become a farce.”</p>
                        <p>He then referred to the fact that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> had repeatedly stated that it had no greater desire than to see complete calm along the border. “There is,” he said, “only one way to bring this about on the Gaza border zone and that is a complete cessation of all aggressive violence on the part of the Egyptian Forces.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> The above is virtually a verbatim report of his remarks which he made at dictation speed and obviously desired that they be accurately recorded. They were it seemed, extemporaneous.</p>
                        <p>I endeavored at several points to inject comment or explanation but this was firmly resisted as he proceeded firmly ahead with his remarks. I was able after his comments, however, to underscore US Government attitude on this policy of retaliation and how such acts upset our timetable in our efforts to promote area stability and Israel’s basic security in particular. I was able also to indicate our failure to understand why the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> was not in favor of joint patrols, pointing up their value in cases such as this last mining incident. I likewise called his attention to the advantages of patrolling further back from the border.</p>
                        <p>It seemed to me that the Prime Minister was “making a case” much as a lawyer would and certainly he was defending vigorously the policy of his government. But it is believed, as has been reported to us from responsible quarters, that his personal views are not those which supported retaliation in this instance (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 984<note n="5" xml:id="d104fn5">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LEB1">Lawson</persName> reported on May 21 in telegram 984 that on the afternoon of May 18 the <gloss target="#t_Mapai1">Mapai</gloss> inner group had considered the mining incident which had resulted in the deaths of the three officers the previous day.

In response to my direct question, he agreed that retaliation seemed to occur when (a) there was loss of Israeli life, and (b) when in the judgment of the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> the aggravating action by the other party is military in character or supported directly or indirectly by the <pb xml:id="pg_197" n="197" facs="0225"/>military. It would appear, therefore, that at the moment at least, the pattern as to when retaliation is to be used has been firmly set.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Mr. Gardiner explained that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Eric Johnston</persName> was prepared to return to the Middle East in early June and act as intermediary between the Arabs and the Israelis in arriving at a solution of the water distribution and storage problems in the Jordan Valley, provided the Israelis would present him with a firm and reasonable offer which he can take to the Arabs. It is hoped that the Israelis will make, formally, a proposal to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> that meets these requirements and is reasonably close to the position reached with the Arabs in Beirut in February 1955. Talks have been held in Washington to this end and were still continuing.</p>
                        <p>Whereas the Israelis previously were prepared to consider the idea of using Lake Tiberias for storing water for Israel and the Arabs, they now wish to delay a decision regarding the storage of water for the Arabs in Tiberias, until the year 1960. The reason for this change in attitude is the failure of the Israelis to find adequate alternate reservoir sites at Sahl Battauf, and elsewhere in Israel. The Israelis have, however, indicated that they would be willing to permit the storage of 300 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">MCM</gloss>s of Arab water in Tiberias if Israel could be provided (at no cost to her) with alternate storage facilities. <pb xml:id="pg_198" n="198" facs="0226"/>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> is seeking Israeli agreement to provide this space for the Arabs at an expenditure not exceeding provable costs of increasing the capacity of the lake to 1,000 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">MCM</gloss>s, a 300 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">MCM</gloss> increase over its present capacity. These costs have been estimated by the Israelis possibly as high as $5 million, although other estimates are considerably lower. The Israelis have also indicated that they much prefer the erection of a high storage dam on the Yarmuk River which the Arabs could utilize for complete control of its waters as an alternative to their using Tiberias for this purpose. This is very likely unacceptable, as such a dam would probably cost around $60 million.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> wishes the Israelis to agree, as an interim measure, to permit the Arabs to utilize water now wasted from Tiberias, by passing it into the proposed “feeder canal” from the Lake to the Eastern Ghor Canal, prior to the date when the Israelis agree to storage of Yarmuk water in Tiberias.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Gardiner said that the Israelis and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> had made progress on ideas for a neutral control authority. The Israelis wish to limit the judgmental powers of the authority, and it is believed that much of its work can be limited to carrying out delivery schedules set in advance, and modified only by prearranged sets of calculations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Gardiner remarked that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> was prepared, as an intermediary, to approach the Arabs with a schedule of division of water less favorable than that agreed upon tentatively in Beirut. He thought there was some chance of Arab acceptance, as limitation of Tiberias storage carried the implication that a high Yarmuk Dam would be a requisite to prevent wastage of water; this the Arabs were most desirous to secure. Problems of quality of water, i.e., its salinity, also remain to be solved.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Gardiner remarked that Sir <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony Eden</persName>’s messages to the Jordanians and Israelis urging their cooperation with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> had been helpful.<note n="2" xml:id="d105fn2">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LEB1">Lawson</persName> informed the Department on April 6 that the British Ambassador on April 5 had transmitted a personal message from <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> in which <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> had “referred to fact that he was encouraged reports of progress in Jordan Valley water negotiations and stressed importance which he attached to their successful conclusion.” (Telegram 863 from Tel Aviv, April 6; <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> 684A.85321/4–655)</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> replied that the Foreign Secretary would be happy to assist Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>’s mission on his next visit to the Middle East if he were asked to do so.</p>

                            </note> Apart from the substantive features of the Alpha plan, in essence Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName>’s recommendations about the procedure boil down to:</p>
                        <p>1. A waiting period of about two weeks to evaluate <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s attitude and to provide <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> an opportunity to further probe the situation. If affirmative indications at Cairo develop, there will then be opportunity to unfold the plan to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> is preparing a draft letter which could be sent either by the Secretary or the President to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>, urging his cooperation.<note n="3" xml:id="d106fn3">See Tab B below.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. In the event that <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName>’s efforts in Cairo prove abortive, then examine the possibilities of working through the Jordanians… .</p>
                        <p>4. If both the Egyptian and Jordan channels bring no success, then in cooperation with the British we would publish our proposals, hoping thus to force the issue and give proof of our constructive attitude.</p>
                        <p>5. The recall of Elath from London and <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> from Washington to Tel Aviv plus other indications in the Gaza area and public statements might indicate if anything a hardening of the Israel attitude.<note n="4" xml:id="d106fn4">The Embassy in London reported that Eliahu Elath, Israel’s Ambassador in the United Kingdom, informed <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> on May 13 that he and <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> had been recalled to Tel Aviv for routine consultations. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName>, however, regarded their recalls to be “further evidence Israeli anxiety regarding plans of U.S. and U.K.” (Telegram 5056 from London, May 17; Department of State, Central Files, 684A.86/ 5–1755)</note>

                        </p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. The Need for a Special Effort to Achieve an Israel-Arab Settlement</p>
                        <p>Arab-Israel tension and hostility, periodically breaking out into armed clashes, have continued for seven years after the signing of Armistice Agreements. The continuance of the dispute will be increasingly a major detriment to vital US interests. The strategic Near East has been economically and politically weakened and divided; the situation contains possibilities of renewed open warfare which might involve states outside the area; and measures for strengthening the area to resist Soviet aggression are greatly hampered.</p>
                        <p>There is no indication that time alone or the efforts of the parties themselves will resolve the smoldering conflict. The bitterness between the parties has thus far resisted efforts by the United Nations and the Western Powers to bring about a settlement of issues. Prospects for the success of a renewed effort are none too bright but a number of considerations lead us to the view that an effort by the US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> should be made: (1) two other major issues which troubled the area—the Anglo-Egyptian dispute and the Iranian oil controversy<note n="9" xml:id="d106fn9">For documentation on the U.S. interest in the settlement of the Anglo-Iranian oil dispute, see <ref target="frus1952-54v10">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1952–1954, volume X</ref>.</note>—have been resolved; (2) US influence in the area has increased considerably as a result of our policy of sympathetic and impartial friendship towards both Arabs and Israelis; (3) <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> influence has been on the increase since the conclusion of the Suez agreement with Egypt; (4) if the effort is not made in 1955, we will probably lose more than just a year, since 1956, a Presidential election year, would not be propitious for such an effort.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Timing and Method of Approach</p>
                        <p>The proposed settlement would involve the solution of the principal issues between Israel and her Arab neighbors, including a cessation of acts of belligerency. It is not proposed, however, to aim immediately at formal and comprehensive peace treaties and the establishment of normal diplomatic relations. It would be hoped that the removal of the principal causes of tension and the passage of time would lead to an ultimate formal peace.</p>
                        <p>It is planned to sound out <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> to see whether Egypt would take the initiative. Egypt has indicated in the past a willingness to <pb xml:id="pg_202" n="202" facs="0230"/>cooperate in taking measures to reduce tension with Israel. The next stage would be a carefully planned disclosure of the suggested elements of a general settlement to Jordan and Israel. Assuming progress, other Arab states as well as other friendly Western powers will be approached shortly after.</p>
                        <p>If this method of approach to the problem should prove unproductive, the proposed terms of settlement might be urged upon the parties publicly by the US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, possibly in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>In view of the inflammability and suspicion in public opinion in the area, the utmost secrecy is essential during the initial stages of the program.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. Elements of a Settlement</p>
                        <p>The following are the principal issues on which it is hoped that settlement can be reached:</p>
                        <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Territorial:</hi> It is proposed that Israel and the neighboring Arab states agree to a definitive border which would include the following adjustments:</p>
                        <p>1. A division of the present “demilitarized zones” and “no man’s lands” created by the Armistice Agreements;</p>
                        <p>2. Returning to border Arab villages, almost entirely in Jordan, a portion of the adjoining farm lands upon which they are dependent for a livelihood and from which they were cut off by the existing Armistice Line. The net total of these cessions by Israel would be 77.5 square miles;</p>
                        <p>3. Giving to Israel a portion of the Latrun salient, making possible the resumption of use of the most direct road from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem;</p>
                        <p>4. Allocating to Egypt and to Jordan triangles of land in the Negev which would make possible land communication between Egypt and the rest of the Arab states, with over- and underpasses connecting the two triangles and the two Israel sections of the Negev;</p>
                        <p>(The area presently occupied by Israel, excluding demilitarized zones, is 7,805 square miles.)</p>
                        <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Refugees:</hi> The approximately 800,000 Arab refugees who fled and were subsequently debarred from their homes in what is now Israel constitute probably the greatest cause of friction between Israel and her Arab neighbors. This problem must be dealt with by a program that calls for the repatriation of a comparatively small proportion of the refugees, the eventual resettlement of the remainder, and compensation for expropriated land.</p>
                        <p>It is proposed that Israel would repatriate up to 75,000 Arab refugees at a rate of 15,000 yearly, with priority being given to those presently living in the Gaza Strip.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_203" n="203" facs="0231"/>
                        <p>Israel would assume a liability of £100 million ($280 million) for the payment for real property left by Arabs who fled Palestine. Israel would also renounce counter-claims which it has against the Arab states, and the Arab refugees would renounce claims for movable personal property and community property. Israel, with assistance from world Jewry, would be asked to raise some 30% of the compensation fund. The balance would be loaned to Israel on a long-term, low-interest basis, primarily by the US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. Payments to individual Arabs would be made through the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> under conditions designed to achieve the greatest amelioration of present bitterness, to encourage work-creating investment in the area, and to prevent inflation.</p>
                        <p>The great bulk of the refugees will have to be resettled, largely in Arab countries where, as a result of expanding economies and projects such as the Jordan Valley Development Plan and the Sinai Project, they could be gradually integrated.</p>
                        <p>C. …</p>
                        <p>D. <hi rend="italic">The Boycott:</hi> The Arab states would remove restrictions on Israel commerce and vessels transiting the Suez Canal; cease their attempts to prevent trade between Israel and non-Arab countries; and repeal all legislation and multilateral boycott arrangements based on the existence of a state of belligerency.

The guaranteeing states would not be bound to intervene in the case of boundary incidents or raids. These would remain the responsibility of the United Nations Truce Supervisory Organization.

                        <p>The Alpha project assumes that economic inducements to Egypt will be required in order to secure her cooperation. One of the most effective forms which this could take would be assistance in financing the construction of the High Aswan Dam. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName>
                            <pb xml:id="pg_205" n="205" facs="0233"/>may soon, if he is to be persuasive, have to make his proposals to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> in definite terms.</p>
                        <p>The cost of the High Aswan Dam (dam, civil works, turbines and generators) is estimated at from $500 to $550 million, spread over a 10-year period, of which roughly 50% would be foreign exchange. The Government of Egypt itself should be able to finance most or all local costs and, by drawing upon its gold reserves, about $85 million of the foreign exchange cost. The <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> might be expected to loan $85 million. Thus, a gap of some $80 million would remain which the US might undertake to provide.</p>
                        <p>Additional auxiliary works (power transmission lines, indemnities to the Sudan, and land reclamation) would add costs of possibly another $500 million, of which about one-fourth would be foreign exchange. The US might well contribute some $20 million of this.</p>
                        <p>Any US assistance in the High Aswan Dam project and auxiliary works should be in the form of grants, since Egypt’s entire ability to finance foreign loans would be committed.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>In anticipation of my commencing leave within a couple of weeks, I am putting down my ideas with respect to various ways <pb xml:id="pg_206" n="206" facs="0234"/>that are open to us to launch the Alpha program, in the order in which I believe they should be considered.</p>
                        <p>1. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> should be given another two or three weeks to see whether an opportunity arises in which to follow up on the discussions about a possible settlement which he had with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> before <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s trip to Bandung. <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> should be authorized to mention the possibility of a US contribution of $100 million to the High Aswan Dam (see my memo of May 18 attached, Tab A<note n="2" xml:id="d107fn2">See the attachment to the memorandum of May 23 from <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>, <hi rend="italic">supra.</hi>
                            </note>).</p>
                        <p>2. If <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> does not find an opportunity to raise Alpha with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> in the normal course of his talks, the President or the Secretary should send a letter to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> which <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> would be authorized to use as a basis for soliciting <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s cooperation in Alpha. The letter would acknowledge that the Gaza raids have made difficult an approach to settlement at this time but state that nevertheless Egypt would stand to gain much from taking the initiative. A draft of such a letter is attached (Tab B).</p>
                        <p>3. If Nos. 1 and 2 should not prove feasible or successful, an approach to Jordan should be made by the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and the US. Although Jordan is handicapped by a weak government and by its weakness in relation to its sister Arab states, it has the largest stake of any Arab country in a settlement with Israel, and the British are in position to exert some pressure.</p>
                        <p>4. Failing in all of the above approaches, the US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> might publicly state their conviction that an equitable settlement of the Israel-Arab dispute is possible and make clear the contribution which the US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> are prepared to make to assist in such a settlement (a guarantee to both sides of the Israel-Arab border, financial assistance in dealing with the refugee problem, and economic aid—e.g., the High Aswan Dam). This could be done through a speech by the Secretary, the publishing of a joint démarche, or introducing a resolution in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. This approach should be used only as a last resort. At best, it would set up a set of specific objectives toward which the Western powers and the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> could exert their influence. At the least, it would provide an answer to Jewish pressure groups until Israel gave its assent to the main elements of such a settlement.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>MY DEAR FRIEND: I am asking Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> to discuss with you a matter of deep interest to me, that is, an accommodation between the Arab States and Israel. I am impressed by the yearning on the part of all of the peoples of the world for a period of tranquillity and a removal of the specter of armed conflict. The Afro-Asian Conference at Bandung, as well as recent events in Europe, reflect this universal feeling. The Bandung communiqué correctly noted the inter-dependence of freedom and peace and the correlation between peace and social and economic progress.</p>
                        <p>Turning specifically to the Near East, I detect a weariness at the existing impasse, a rejection of negativism, and an eagerness to find a positive forward policy. The record of your Government in espousing social and economic development and in solving troublesome international questions such as the Suez Base controversy leads me to the thought that Egypt might wish to assert area leadership by example and undertake the task of resolving the Arab-Israeli problem.</p>
                        <p>I recognize the difficulties in the way of any Arab-Israel settlement—the periodic border outbursts do not serve in any way to lessen them—but I am convinced that it is possible to reach agreements which will bring to all the nations concerned definite advantages over the existing situation. Besides removing the constant danger of a renewal of hostilities, an accommodation would give added impetus to social and economic programs which, as your Government has correctly diagnosed, are indispensable to progress and security. Countries of the Western world, including the United States, would find it easier to extend appropriate assistance which might be requested. Accordingly, I hope that it will be possible to work out with you proposals which subsequently may be discussed with other interested countries in the area. I understand that the present Prime Minister of Great Britain expressed to you similar thoughts during your discussions in January of this year.<note n="4" xml:id="d107fn4">Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> spoke with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> on February 20.</note>

                        <p>I am suggesting that you take the leadership in this matter because of my high respect for your achievements and reliance upon your statesmanship. It is my conviction that this problem will yield to our cooperative efforts as other difficult ones have done with results beneficial to all the peoples concerned.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The following are recommended as steps to be taken during the next few weeks to launch the Alpha program:</p>
                        <p>1. A telegram to <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> saying the time is growing short in which Alpha must be launched if it is to make significant progress during the present year; urge him to proceed as rapidly as possible in discussions with <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> and, if occasion offers, with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>; authorize him to refer to the possibility of US aid on the High Aswan Dam, in the context of Alpha settlement, bearing in mind that the ultimate figure might be around $100 million although no specific commitments should be made; say that if it appears that, at the end of three or four weeks, no early progress with the Government of Egypt is <pb xml:id="pg_211" n="211" facs="0239"/>likely, we intend to approach the Jordanian and Lebanese Governments.</p>
                        <p>2. Send copies of Alpha summaries to Ambassadors Mallory and <persName corresp="#p_HDR1">Heath</persName>; say we have been hoping that the Egyptians would cooperate in launching Alpha but this appears unlikely at the present time, and we are giving serious thought to possible approaches to Jordan and Lebanon.</p>
                        <p>3. If, at the end of three or four weeks, no favorable response has been obtained from the Egyptian Government, instruct our ambassadors to approach the Jordanian and—if Jordan’s response warranted—the Lebanese Government. The inducements which we would advance to Jordan are set forth in the attached Tab A. The inducements to Lebanon are set forth in the attached Tab B.</p>
                        <p>4. The built-in inducements in Alpha, however, will probably not be enough to secure Jordanian and Lebanese cooperation. Both countries have evinced some interest in adhering to the Turk-Iraq pact: Lebanon in connection with arms aid; Jordan in connection with possible substitution for the present Anglo-Jordanian treaty of [or] one similar to the new Anglo-Iraq treaty. Our existing policy contemplated delaying Jordanian and Lebanese adherence to the Turk-Iraq treaty until after Alpha implementation. It might be possible to secure Jordanian and Lebanese cooperation in Alpha by linking the two developments. This would mean that:</p>
                        <list type="simple">
                            <item>(a) Alpha would be raised with Jordan and Lebanon simultaneously with discussion of their possible adherence to the Turk-Iraq treaty and attendant benefits to each therefrom. We would make clear we could not support such adherence in the absence of an Alpha settlement.</item>
                            <item>(b) If, in the context of Alpha, developments point toward Jordan–Lebanon adherence to the Turk-Iraq pact, the US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> should plan to hold discussions with the Israel Government about its participation in area defense (confined to use of Israel bases, harbor facilities, and protection of Israel Government territory and waters).</item>
                            <item>(c) The US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would bring pressure upon Iraq not to interfere with Jordanian and Lebanese cooperation in Alpha, pointing out the advantages to Iraq from Jordanian-Lebanese adherence to the Turk-Iraq pact, which the US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> could then support.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>5. An effort should be made to induce the Israel Government, pending the above, to refrain from acts (e.g., increased border activity, or publication of an Israel Government plan for settlement) that would hurt Alpha.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. The status quo in the Near East is not in Jordan’s interest. Her economy can never be properly developed in the present situation. All Jordan’s neighbor states contain elements which entertain notions as to Jordan’s future which do not coincide with Jordan’s interests… .</p>
                        <p>2. Jordan is bearing a heavier burden as a result of the Palestine hostilities than any other Arab state. The largest share of the sporadic hostilities falls upon Jordan, and it is her trade and communications with the outside world which have been the most thoroughly damaged. Jordan therefore has the most to gain from a resolution of the Palestine issue. It is time for Jordan to look to her own interests and to select a course of action which will benefit her the most. The US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> could then cooperate with Jordan in persuading other Arab states of the necessity of Jordan’s participating in a just and equitable settlement of the controversy. Past experience has shown that Jordan’s leaving the initiative to other Arab states is fruitless and dangerous.</p>
                        <p>3. In the type of settlement which we have in mind, Jordan will receive a good portion of what she has demanded. There will be provisions for territorial adjustments, repatriation of some refugees, rehabilitation of the rest, and arrangements for compensation. The US would likewise be prepared to support Jordan in obtaining facilities through Israel for communicating with other Arab states and the outside world… . Jordan is already aware of our active support of the proposition that she must have her full share of the waters of the entire Jordan–Yarmuk system.</p>
                        <p>4. We fully appreciate that any settlement at all, no matter how just and equitable, would arouse considerable opposition among certain extreme elements in Jordan’s population and create a serious internal security situation. To this end we would be prepared to consult with the Jordanians on ways in which we can be of assistance in dealing with this problem during the transition period. We would also be prepared to speak to Israel in the strongest terms of the necessity for a tranquil border situation.</p>

                        <p rend="center">LEBANON: INDUCEMENTS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS IN SECURING COOPERATION</p>
                        <p>1. The Lebanese are most anxious to receive military aid from the US, desiring it primarily for internal security and prestige, and as a sign of the recognition by the US of the importance of Lebanon. The cost to the US would be perhaps $5 to $10 million.</p>
                        <p>2. The Lebanese would like to receive economic aid on a much larger scale than at present (in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 they received $6 million economic assistance; the figure for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 will be much smaller). The Lebanese would like us to finance a significant portion of the Litani River development project, and they would like large-scale help, for instance, with their road program. An offer of some $10 million for these or similar purposes, over and above our “normal” technical assistance and economic aid, would be a genuine inducement.</p>
                        <p>3. Like the other Arab states, Lebanon fears that Israel, unless held in check, may some day attempt to expand at Lebanon’s expense. The Lebanese fear that Israel some day may attempt by force to establish control over the waters of the Litani River for the benefit of Israel. A Western security guarantee of Lebanon against the possibility of an attack by Israel would remove these fears. A “<gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>-type” guarantee<note n="4" xml:id="d110fn4">Reference is to the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty signed at Manila, September 8, 1954.</note> of Lebanon’s borders against Israel aggression (and vice versa), conditional upon a Lebanon-Israel peace settlement, would thus constitute an effective inducement.</p>
                        <p>4. A basic fear in the dominant <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Christian</persName> element in Lebanon is that some day the country may lose its separate identity through absorption into the neighboring Moslem states, particularly Syria. An offer by the Western powers to help maintain somehow the integrity of Lebanon as a separate entity would be most welcome to the dominant <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Christian</persName> element. If the other inducements turn out to be sufficient to persuade Lebanon to undertake a settlement, consideration might be given to the possibility of US-<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-French offers to take steps to maintain Lebanese independence should it be threatened from any quarter. This could take the form of confidential explanations to the Lebanese that the US (or the three powers) will agree to interpret the Tripartite Declaration of May 1950 as specifically guaranteeing the integrity of Lebanon. For example, we might offer—conditional on a Lebanon-Israel settlement—to take <pb xml:id="pg_214" n="214" facs="0242"/>action “both within and outside the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>” if the integrity of Lebanon is threatened ….</p>

                        <p>693. Please make following statement to Israel <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> leaving with him written memorandum and advising him you acting under instructions your govt:</p>
                        <p>1. US deplores grave incident which took place in Gaza Strip on night May 30 and regrets casualties. From evidence assembled by <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> it appears this incident was started when Egyptian outpost fired on Israel jeep in Israel territory.</p>
                        <p>2. We have accordingly made strong representations to Egyptians and condemned this type behavior.</p>
                        <p>3. At same time we cannot exonerate Israel from all responsibility for tragic sequence events which has taken place in Gaza area since reprisal raid of Feb. 28 for which Israel condemned by <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. We have already made clear to Israel <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> our unalterable opposition to an apparent Israel policy of armed retaliation. We are further concerned at Israel practice of operating patrol vehicles along demarcation line. While such practice might be technically within Israel’s sovereign right it is inevitably most provocative in character and indicates complete disregard for necessity of diminishing tensions in area and bringing an end to this bloody cycle of incidents.</p>
                        <p>5. Facts as we see them clearly belie assertion which we see from time to time among some quarters Israel public opinion that retaliatory raids have effect of reducing border tension. Opposite is the case.</p>
                        <p>6. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> urgently requests that Israel Defense Forces cease taking actions which are provocative in their effect and cooperate fully with Bums and <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> in implementation of practical measures aimed at reduction border tensions.<note n="2" xml:id="d111fn2">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LEB1">Lawson</persName> informed the Department on June 3 that he had repeatedly set forth the views transmitted in Department telegram 693 to the Israeli Government; thus, he believed “transmittal Department’s statement with heavy concentration criticism on Israel’s behavior and with little detail of what is being said to Egyptians would prove counter productive.” (Telegram 1021 from Tel Aviv; <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> 674.84A/ 6–355) The Department responded on June 4 that it wished <persName corresp="#p_LEB1">Lawson</persName> to “make it clear that we cannot concur in policy of retaliation” and that the messages to Israel and Egypt (telegram 2090 to Cairo, June 2, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>) should be delivered simultaneously.

                        <p>2090. Please make following statement to Egyptian <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> leaving with him written memorandum and advising him you acting under instructions your govt:</p>
                        <p>1. The US has followed with the gravest concern the tragic sequence of events along the Gaza frontier since the Israel raid into Gaza on Feb. 28.</p>
                        <p>2. This Govt supported action in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> condemning Israel for Gaza raid and will continue oppose Israel actions of armed reprisal. At same time both <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> and this Govt have strongly urged Egypt to take effective measures to cooperate with <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> in maintaining tranquillity along border.</p>
                        <p>3. Our information is to effect that the major incident which occurred night May 30 commenced when Egyptian outposts fired on Israel jeep in Israel territory. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is compelled to express to Egyptian Govt in strongest terms fact that failure adopt adequate measures to prevent such behavior is strongly deplored by this Govt. It displays a lack of respect for the armistice agreements.</p>
                        <p>4. It seems to us that the Egyptian Govt by permitting such behavior in Gaza Strip is forfeiting what was essentially an advantageous position for Egypt in eyes of world opinion. Furthermore, such action adds to risk of open conflict along frontier. In view of <pb xml:id="pg_216" n="216" facs="0244"/>publicly expressed policies of Egypt with regard to lack of intent resort to force in her relations with Israel, this Govt fails understand how courting the risk of major hostilities can benefit Egypt or the interest of area peace generally.</p>
                        <p>5. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> fervently hopes that Egypt will take the strongest measures to impose effective discipline in the territory under her occupation and to cooperate fully with <persName>Burns</persName> and <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> in implementation of practical measures aimed at reduction of border tension.<note n="2" xml:id="d112fn2">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> reported on June 4 that, pursuant to the Department’s instructions contained in telegram 2090, he had handed a memorandum to Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName>.

                        <p>849. Re Palestine in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. <persName>Dixon</persName> (<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>) called at his request to discuss current Gaza situation. He had no new facts to add to our present knowledge of the situation, but wished to discuss the <pb xml:id="pg_217" n="217" facs="0245"/>possibilities of action by the three powers, either in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or elsewhere. He expressed some surprise that <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> Hammarskjold had not already asked to meet with the three powers on the situation. <gloss target="#t_ONE1">One</gloss> suggestion he put forward was for us to stimulate a meeting with the <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> to consider matters.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Dixon</persName> appeared to believe that <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> would censure Egypt for incident of May 30, and fully expected Israel to come to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> seeking endorsement of <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> finding. As possible alternative to awaiting this result, <persName>Dixon</persName> suggested three powers might summon Egypt and Israel to the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> and, in effect, read the riot act to them. He felt there were certain disadvantages to this, however, such as: (a) forcing parties to take extreme positions; and (b) risking an upset to the progress made thus far by General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName>.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName>Dixon</persName> that we agreed things were a little worse than usual, but that we had no specific thoughts on what should be done about it. I told him we would get in touch as soon as we had anything to offer.</p>
                        <p>It would not seem helpful and might be harmful to have regular session of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> at which Israeli and Egyptians would give a repeat performance.</p>
                        <p>Likewise unless we have some particular course which we wish to press, it would be preferable not to stimulate a meeting between the Secretary General and the three powers. Our initiative in this matter would make it most difficult to refuse support to any suggestions of the Secretary General which might be contrary to our policy. We can assume that the Secretary General is fully aware of the events in the area and if such a meeting were to be held, the initiative should be his.</p>
                        <p>One course which would at least have the advantage of novelty and might have some impact would be to have <persName>Burns</persName> summoned to New York to report fully to a closed session of the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> at which the Egyptians and Israelis would not be present. <persName>Burns</persName> would be expected to give, as he has given in private to governmental representatives, a frank assessment of the most important elements creating tension. These would undoubtedly include the provocative effect of Israeli patrols practically on the demarcation line and Egyptian failure effectively to prevent infiltration and mining. <gloss target="#t_ONE1">One</gloss> meeting of the Council should suffice to hear the report. <persName>Burns</persName> would return to Jerusalem immediately. The <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> could then press for practical measures which would remove the most immediate causes of friction, including perhaps (1) joint patrols, (2) joint mine-clearing, (3) mutual withdrawal to specified distance from the demarcation line, and (4) effective Egyptian control over the troops and population in the Gaza area.</p>

                        <p>The United States and the United Kingdom believe that the time has come to explore the possibilities of promoting conditions of peace and prosperity in Israel and the neighboring Arab countries. In that area the opportunities of the people are tragically shrunken by the aftermath of the hostilities of 1947<note n="4" xml:id="d117fn4">Hostilities in Palestine began in May 1948.</note> (?).<note n="5" xml:id="d117fn5">This and subsequent question marks appear in the source text.</note> The large-scale fighting of that year was brought to a close by armistices negotiated under the auspices of the United Nations. But there is no genuine peace and armed clashes are a frequent occurrence. The lines as defined by the armistices are in many respects artificial. They sometimes unnaturally separate homes and villages from their appurtenant gardens and wells. They deny direct land contact from Egypt with other Arab States. Water rights are ill-defined and legal uncertainties under the armistices prevent the maximum development of precious water in those arid lands. Economic relations between Israel and neighboring states are negligible and Israel has only uncertain use of the Suez Canal. The Arab refugees, numbering some 600,000(?), are still living in refugee settlements of the most primitive character and their lives depend precariously upon charity. No adequate compensation has been made for the homes and possessions of which the refugees have been deprived in Israel.</p>
                        <p>Jerusalem, containing the Holy places of three great religions, each of which teaches love, is a vortex of hatred; and pilgrims from all over the world are denied adequate access to the places they revere.</p>
                        <p>But over and above all this there is fear that relations will further deteriorate. The Arabs fear lest Israel seek violently to expand at their expense. The Israelis fear that the Arabs will gradually marshal superior forces to be used eventually to drive them into the sea. This fear hangs like a pall over the Arab and Israeli people. It leads to military preparations which drain the already poor economies of the countries concerned.</p>
                        <p>The fear on both sides is so great that other countries which would aid both Israel and the neighboring Arab States find it difficult to do so without attracting the animosity of those whom they would befriend in a spirit of impartiality. Thus, an area of vast cultural and strategic value is so weakened by strains and stresses <pb xml:id="pg_224" n="224" facs="0252"/>between its component parts that it could readily fall prey to aggression from without.</p>
                        <p>Surely it lies within the capacity of the statesmanship, within and without the area concerned, to better this situation.</p>
                        <p>The United States and the United Kingdom see possibilities of a happier condition. This condition we outline in the hope that its manifest advantages to all concerned will come to be appreciated and bring about the concurrent efforts needed for its achievement.</p>
                        <p rend="center">II.</p>
                        <p>1. The boundaries as fixed by the armistices should be rectified and as so rectified accepted as permanent. This recommendation would not appreciably alter the usable area of Israel or impair its strategic or economic assets. It would do away with local causes of frictions which have no adequate justification.</p>
                        <p>In addition to local adjustments, Egypt should have sovereignty over a triangular portion of the Negeb area as is appropriate to assure it direct territorial contact with Saudi Arabia or with Jordan. This Egyptian triangle would be selected from land without agricultural or mineral value and presently unsettled. There is ample land in the Negeb which meets these specifications.</p>
                        <p>Since, however, Israel should also have contact with the port of</p>
                        <p>_,<note n="6" xml:id="d117fn6">
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> failed to indicate the port in question.</note> there will inevitably be a point of Egypt and Israel</p>
                        <p>crossing at the Eastern apex of the Egyptian triangle. There, the sovereignty of one will have to be in terms of an overpass and the sovereignty of the other in terms of an underpass.</p>
                        <p>2. The permanent boundaries between Israel and the Arab States should be internationally guaranteed, preferably under United Nations auspices, so that neither the Arabs nor the Israelis need henceforth fear a forcible change of boundary at their expense and so that both Arabs and Israelis may henceforth devote their efforts to causes more productive than preparations for possible war against each other.</p>
                        <p>3. Funds should be provided by Israel to permit the resettlement of the Arab refugees, chiefly in Arab territory. These funds will represent just compensation by Israel for the properties of Arabs which have been taken, so far without such compensation.</p>
                        <p>4. Resettlement is not merely a question of money but of creating additional permanent means of livelihood. This, in turn, requires more irrigated land. A first step in this direction would be the “<persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>” plan which already has been negotiated to a point of near acceptability to all the parties concerned.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_225" n="225" facs="0253"/>
                        <p>The compensation fund above referred to should be primarily used, and should be supplemented, to make up the funds required to develop additional water for the irrigation of land in those countries which contribute to the solution here envisioned.</p>
                        <p>5. The portion of Jerusalem which principally contains the Holy places should be vested in an international body which will be an organ of the United Nations. It will maintain the Holy places and guarantee equal access to pilgrims of Jewish, Moslem and <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Christian</persName> faiths.</p>
                        <p>6. The Suez Canal will be open to Israeli flag traffic on the same terms as the traffic of other nations, as called for by the United Nations Security Council Resolution of_, 1954.<note n="7" xml:id="d117fn7">Reference is to the U.N. Security Council resolution adopted on September 1, 1951.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p rend="center">III.</p>
                        <p>In the event that Israel and any one or more of her Arab neighbors desire to proceed on the basis of the foregoing principles, insofar as applicable to them, the United States and the United Kingdom would be willing to contribute to bring about the acceptance and implementation of these principles. They would:</p>
                        <p>1. Lend their good offices to facilitate a direct exchange of views between the parties concerned or an exchange of views through themselves or other acceptable intermediaries.</p>
                        <p>2. Join in giving firm guarantees of the new permanent boundaries as against future changes by force.</p>
                        <p>3. Advance to the State of Israel funds to assist in making compensation to the refugees for the property taken, and thus facilitate their permanent resettlement.</p>
                        <p>4. Make financial advances to Israel and to participating Arab States directly or through the United Nations, so as to permit water development which will increase the arable land of participating nations of the area.</p>
                        <p>The measures enumerated in Points 2 to 4, inclusive, depend upon parliamentary approvals which would be sought.</p>

                        <p>The program here outlined will serve, and will strengthen, each of the Near East nations individually; and the aggregate result will be to end a threat to world peace. The processes will deprive no nation of any rights, since renunciation of force in international relations is already required by the Charter of the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>The Governments of the United States and the United Kingdom would be pleased to receive in due course any observations from the <pb xml:id="pg_226" n="226" facs="0254"/>governments concerned on the point of view set forth in this memorandum.</p>

                        <p>1034. I met with Prime Minister at noon yesterday in his office in Tel Aviv (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1028)<note n="2" xml:id="d118fn2">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LEB1">Lawson</persName> reported on June 6 that he had met with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> that day and had conveyed to him the message transmitted in telegram 693 to Tel Aviv (<ref target="#d111">Document 111</ref>) as well as the Department’s other comments suggested in telegrams 699 (same as 1850 to Cairo; see <ref target="#d116fn3">footnote 3, Document 116</ref>) and 700 to Tel Aviv (see <ref target="#d111fn2">footnote 2, Document 111</ref>). (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 674.84A/6–655)</note> and handed him memorandum transmitted <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 693. In subsequent oral conversation I emphasized to him that our representations to Egypt were stated strongly and dealt with specific measures required by Egypt to bring the Gaza strip situation under control. Secondly, I informed him that we were pressing <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> to agree to high level talks, adding that the British and French were taking similar measures (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 699). With reference to <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 700 I reminded <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> distinctly that the tripartite declaration applies to armistice lines as well as to frontiers.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister read the memorandum and although apparently taking the final paragraphs most seriously, made no comment until he had finished reading and I had completed my statements as indicated above. He then said he would like to give me his reactions in a completely friendly manner and with full appreciation of the promptness with which the US Government had made representations to <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> and informed him of those actions.</p>
                        <p>His first comment referred to paragraph three <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 693. He said with regard to the tragic sequence of events since February 28, he must point out that the initial action in every case had been taken “by the other side”—that every cycle of trouble had been started by Egypt. He also reiterated his previous arguments to the effect that, while opinions may differ regarding Israel’s use of patrols, there was no justification whatever for Egypt to follow its program of persistent firing on those patrols.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_227" n="227" facs="0255"/>
                        <p>Regarding high level talks and cooperation with <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss>, he said he was planning to talk with General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> the following morning. He underlined the fact that Egypt had not yet replied to <persName>Burns</persName>’ invitation to a joint high level meeting, which invitation the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> had accepted immediately. He then raised certain objections to the new conditions which had been introduced in connection with the proposed talks as reported to him by General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName>. He was especially critical of <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s insistence that high level (military) talks must be premised on prior acceptance by <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> of <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s proposal for a demilitarized zone.<note n="3" xml:id="d118fn3">Reference is to a proposal which <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> made to <persName>Burns</persName> on June 1 and <persName>Burns</persName> conveyed to the Israelis the following day for withdrawal of all Egyptian and Israeli troops from a zone one half or one kilometer wide on both sides of the line of demarcation. (Telegram 346 from Jerusalem, June 3; <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> 674.84À/6–355) <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> reported on June 5 that <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> had told <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Stevenson</persName> the previous day that the Egyptians were willing to conduct high-level talks with the Israelis if they accepted this proposal. (Telegram 1850 from Cairo, June 5; <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> 674.84A/6–555)</note> He remarked that the theory of demilitarized zones had been proven generally in practice as ineffective and a source of continuing trouble. He spoke at some length on the inequities of the proposal as viewed by Israel, pointed out that infiltration was solely an Egyptian action as Israel did not practice it. He said, “we do not infiltrate into Gaza. The infiltrators come from Gaza and although the situation has improved in that respect and it is not the major problem now, the demilitarized zone proposal would recreate this problem in a very serious manner. Thus, the emphasis would be shifted from the present military problem to that of infiltration”. With regard to both infiltration but especially military actions by persons in Gaza, he said “we do not say our irregulars or unknown persons perpetrate these actions. Quite the contrary. We decided, as in a recent incident, who was responsible. The Egyptians say they cannot be responsible for some of these actions. In the latest Burns-Nasser talk, <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> admitted that Egyptian troops had opened fire but repudiated responsibility for mine laying, saying he did not know who did it. We do not say this. In the face of mutual evacuation, therefore, it could not be the same for Israel as for Egypt; Egypt will not be prevented from using irregulars, and this is of no small danger from Israel’s viewpoint”. He also said, “to evacuate troops from the area would leave the ground free for marauding, theft, pillaging and other incidents. The presence of troops prevents that. Any suggestion to Israel to accept the withdrawal of troops proposal unconditionally would seem to betray a lack of familiarity with the problem and could lead to one-sidedly grave effects”.</p>
                        <p>I suggested that joint patrols could supply the necessary controls in the evacuated areas. He gave no convincing reply to that point <pb xml:id="pg_228" n="228" facs="0256"/>and after an exchange of arguments and comment, he admitted that this point could be considered at any joint high level meeting eventually set up. I also suggested that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>’s initial lack of enthusiasm for the “no man’s land” plan was to a considerable extent due to the fact that the plan was advanced by <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>. He then inquired whether the present reaction to the plan might be substantially improved if the project were presented formally by General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName>. (<persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> had previously advanced claim that Egypt was clearly the aggressor and was now seeking its reward for aggression by presenting this plan and Israel could not accept such dictation “at the point of a bayonet”.) The reply to my question was non-committal but it was clear that he saw the point. I took this opportunity to again emphasize the very substantial progress which would be made if a high level military meeting, without any prior rejections or prior acceptances of conditions applying to subjects which might be discussed at such meetings, could be arranged.</p>
                        <p>At the close of our conversations, which were conducted pleasantly and in a relaxed atmosphere, we summed up our understandings as described above and it was agreed that I would report back to Washington that <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> had no objections to a high level military meeting and would make no advance rejection of any concrete proposals prior to such meeting. This understanding with <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> was arrived at, however, only after I had urged him not to fake [<hi rend="italic">make</hi>?] a categorical rejection of the proposal for a “no man’s land”, pointing out that such action would be as open to criticism as was <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s demand for a categorical acceptance by Israel of his plan—a condition to which <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> had strongly objected.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> I was unable to determine whether <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> was reflecting directly the sense of the Cabinet meeting held on Sunday,<note n="4" xml:id="d118fn4">June 5.</note> which is reported to have considered the Gaza situation. This seems likely although no firm or formal decision may have been made at that meeting. When I left him, I again reminded him that there should be no rejection of any proposal prior to the talks and he confirmed my understanding. <persName corresp="#p_HCC1">Herzog</persName> of Foreign Office, who was present during the conversation, undertook to again stress to the Prime Minister the visible disadvantages to Israel of a rejection of the demilitarized zone plan prior to the high level meeting.</p>
                        <p>However, some afternoon papers carried stories that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> had rejected the demilitarized zone plan. Later in the day I talked to <persName corresp="#p_HCC1">Herzog</persName> about these stories and he assured me that they had no authorized basis but that they would add a new factor and that Prime Minister had commented to him that every effort should be

                        <p>In discussing above <persName>Burns</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> had objected to setting up neutral zone on grounds that it would increase possibilities for infiltration. <persName>Burns</persName> pointed out that conclusion of a local commanders agreement allowing police operate in neutral zone should overcome that objection. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> alluded to Egyptian reservations about such an agreement. In view their objections direct telephone contact he felt such an agreement would prove ineffectual. <persName>Burns</persName> replied that Egyptians have recently modified their stand and have indicated to him that they might accept some form of quasi-direct communications possibly handled through <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> personnel Gaza area. He also told <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>, in reply to some comment of latter, that Egyptians now more favorably inclined his proposal about erection barbed wire barrier, not on frontier perhaps but possibly small distance their side of boundary.</p>
                        <p>In reply to my inquiry, <persName>Burns</persName> agreed that choice Egyptian Chief of Staff or other ranking military figure represent Egypt at prospective high-level talks was not ideal and that matter might better be handled by civilian officials. In his view, however, Egypt will not agree to send civilian. He strongly recommended as practical matter acquiescing Egyptians wishes on this point. He hoped Dayan might prove fairly reasonable, assuming he would be Israel’s representative.

                        <p>With respect to the Secretary’s memo of June 6<note n="4" xml:id="d120fn4">Attached to <ref target="#d117">Document 117</ref>.</note> proposing memoranda setting forth the general principles of the Alpha proposals to Israel and the Arab states, to be made public shortly thereafter, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> said that our Missions in Cairo, Amman and Beirut, in response to a Department telegram sent May 28<note n="5" xml:id="d120fn5">
                                <ref target="#d109">Document 109</ref>.</note> suggesting a US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> announcement of settlement proposals, had given their opinion that such a step would hurt Alpha prospects. The British had also expressed their opposition to such a step until secret negotiations had been fully tried.<note n="6" xml:id="d120fn6">See <ref target="#d109fn3">footnote 3, Document 109</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> suggested as steps to advance Alpha: Departmental approval of the Alpha summary (memo to the Secretary of May 18<note n="7" xml:id="d120fn7">Attached to <ref target="#d106">Document 106</ref>.</note>); authorization for <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> to offer US financial help on the High Aswan Dam; a telegram to <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> instructing him to raise Alpha with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> within the next few weeks; preparing Mallory <pb xml:id="pg_232" n="232" facs="0260"/>and <persName corresp="#p_HDR1">Heath</persName> to broach Alpha to the Jordanian and Lebanese Governments in the event that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> refused cooperation (possibly linking area defense steps with Alpha as suggested in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName>’s memo to the Secretary of June 2<note n="8" xml:id="d120fn8">
                                <ref target="#d110">Document 110</ref>.</note>); and the preparation of a public statement on Alpha which would be ready for use in the event all of the above efforts failed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> said that such a schedule would give <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Eric Johnston</persName> another month within which to make a final effort to negotiate agreement on the Jordan Valley Plan.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary cautioned against revealing any of the details of the Alpha plan to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> or any of the other governments. He said that any approach should be only in the form of suggesting the general principles on which a settlement might be based. Any mention of specific amounts—such as the amount of compensation to be paid to the refugees, or the amount of economic aid that would be forthcoming as a result of a settlement—would be unwise, as any figure which might be mentioned would be regarded by the parties only as a starting point for bargaining. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> said that the figures contained in the Alpha documents were regarded by both the British and us as our concept of final figures, and that any early negotiations would have to take that into account.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary went on to say that he believed a public statement of Alpha, either in the form of memoranda to the interested governments or a speech which he might give, would be preferable to secret negotiations. He said he believed the prospects of success through secret negotiations were slight; the result of pursuing them further might be either a long delay through waiting for the proper moment to arrive or a turn-down. If any success is to be achieved it must be this year, as the whole subject of Israel-Arab relations will be a political football in 1956. This would undo the improvement in our relations with most of the states in the area during the past two years. If we approach the states through secret negotiations and are turned down, any subsequent public enunciation of Alpha would be regarded by them as an effort to coerce them into doing something which they had already refused to do. On the other hand, a public statement of Alpha objectives and principles must appeal to the good judgment of all concerned. There might be immediate negative responses but both Israel and Arab public opinion would, on second thought, realize that there were great advantages to both sides. World opinion, too, should rally to its support.</p>
                        <p>There was some discussion about the probable grounds that would be advanced by Israelis or Arabs for refusing the plan. The Secretary said that he felt that the objections were so weak that they could be overcome. The Secretary pointed out that there had been <pb xml:id="pg_233" n="233" facs="0261"/>an initial negative reaction in the case of Trieste but that a settlement was eventually achieved. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRA1">Hare</persName> said that the Arabs would be nonplussed at first but that certain points in the Alpha plan would have obvious attraction for them. The Secretary said that the situation in the area is deteriorating and that it is difficult to see how the parties could feel there was any alternative to an Alpha approach.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> suggested that the possible disadvantage of initial secret negotiations which the Secretary had mentioned, i.e., that it would make difficult a subsequent public statement if they had previously expressed their opposition, might be overcome by our saying in our confidential presentation that we were planning on presenting our proposals publicly but wished first to have their reaction and, hopefully, their cooperation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> said that he felt there were disadvantages to starting off with a public statement. For example, it would harden Israel and American Jewish opinion against any border alterations. The Secretary replied that any public proposals on borders should be a general statement of principles, such as the suggestion of triangles with over- and under-passes, leaving it to the parties to negotiate their location and size.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary reiterated that he did not think there was any chance of secret negotiations bringing any positive result within the present year. If the Department does not have an established position on the Israel-Arab issue by the end of this year, both political parties will take extreme positions in the elections, which would result in the loss of the Arab world to the West.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> suggested that we might first seek a settlement between Israel and Lebanon. The Under Secretary said that there is not time at our disposal for the snowballing effect which we would hope such an approach might produce. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRA1">Hare</persName> pointed out that such an approach would require us to make a “client state” of Lebanon, since she would become immediately the object of political and economic pressures by the other Arab states.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked that a draft public statement of the Alpha proposals be prepared<note n="9" xml:id="d120fn9">On June 15, <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> sent the Secretary, under cover of a memorandum, a draft public statement on Alpha which he could use in his discussions with <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> most cordial and talkative. Stated they would not be “inactive” re <persName>Burns</persName> message. He meeting late tonight with advisers and then <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>. Council of Ministers apparently also meeting tonight.</p>
                        <p>I stated as I familiar with <persName>Burns</persName> message because use our communications I felt it incumbent upon me urge early positive response. Message after all indicated Israelis had abandoned Foreign Office participation and it seemed clear political subjects would not be involved. Also “Generals” were specified which ruled out <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> participation. Message clearly states Israelis willing talk about <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s proposal and would seem to indicate even joint patrols might be discussed.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> said he glad I had come and he would pass along my feeling acceptance best for Egypt re <persName>Burns</persName> use our channels and memo handed me earlier today (my telegram 1865<note n="3" xml:id="d121fn3">Telegram 1865 transmitted the text of a June 8 memorandum from the Egyptian Foreign Office replying to an Embassy memorandum of June 4 (sent in accordance with the instructions in <ref target="#d112">Document 112</ref>). The Egyptian memorandum declared that Israel was “obstructing, under flimsy pretexts, all proposals aiming at easing border tension” while Egypt was implementing them. It concluded: “In view of what precedes, the Egyptian Govt deprecates the assumption made in the memo in question that it lacks respect for the Armistice Agreement and wishes to trust that the Govt of the United States will in future desist from leveling at the Govt of Egypt such free accusations or to couch its communications in terms which are hardly becoming to the best traditions of internatl parlance.” (Department of State, Central Files, 674.84A/ 6–855)</note>) wished say he <pb xml:id="pg_235" n="235" facs="0263"/>convinced US not up to any underhand or partial attitude this situation as continuation present dangerous drift not in US interest. He hopeful as to Egypt’s decision.</p>
                        <p>One matter of concern to him (which I was fearful would be the case) was specific reference to “one kilometer” withdrawal. He reiterated that what <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had suggested was principle of “no-mans-land” without prejudging specific lines. I told him I thought Egypt would have logical position if they took this attitude in conference. It clear however they worried about this as <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> said he made this point clear in his last conversation with <persName>Burns</persName> and wondered why specific distance still retained by him.</p>
                        <p>As to representatives, he said repeated reference “level” rather amazing. They prepared pick man of ability who could speak for <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> and this should be adequate. I urged, nevertheless, that they meet stipulated rank of General. He said thought they could, but smiled and said after all Prime Minister was only Lieutenant Colonel.</p>
                        <p>My net impression is that <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> will try hard for acceptance. He seems worried about agenda which I cautioned they not quibble about in view <persName>Burns</persName>’ message.</p>
                        <p>Following above subject, had general foreign policy exchange which was most encouraging since my arrival. As am seeing <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> tomorrow will withhold report until see nature that meeting.<note n="4" xml:id="d121fn4">See <ref target="#d120fn10">footnote 10, Document 120</ref>.</note>

                        <p>1880. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> told me this morning he would not accept meeting with Israelis at “high level”. He would accept meeting based upon <persName>Burns</persName>’ recent message (Jerusalem’s 171 to Cairo)<note n="2" xml:id="d122fn2">See <ref target="#d119fn2">footnote 2, Document 119</ref>.</note> but only with Lt. Col. Gohar representing Egypt. Gohar was his most qualified man and he would give him authority to commit Government of Egypt. Israelis could not dictate whom he must choose to put in position of such responsibility and he would not let <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>’s attempt to do so at point of gun succeed. He and whole Arab world familiar with tactics of Israelis over past several years to attempt shoot their way into such talks. He would not place himself in eyes of his army, Egypt and Arab world in light of having been forced to accept such talks by threat of force. He furthermore would not allow Israelis who believe this best tactic dealing with Arabs to be able to propagandize to his humiliation that their tactics had succeeded.</p>
                        <p>Used every argument I could think of to cause him to change his mind. Pointed out apparent concessions made by Israel in latest <persName>Burns</persName> message. Consequences of Egypt’s refusal, however strongly he might feel on these matters, were certain not to be in Egypt’s advantage. Regardless of instructions I might be given, I could not have used more forceful language in trying to convince him he must meet stipulation of “General” officer. Do not believe I succeeded. While to me his logic unassailable and feelings perhaps can be forgiven, greatly fear consequences of such a reply from Egypt. If it proves anything it should be one more evidence that Israeli tactics of dealing with Arabs are not correct and lead to greater intransigence on Arab side.</p>
                        <p>If Egypt’s answer to <persName>Burns</persName> is along expected lines my first thought is that we should at least try persuade Israelis to cooperate in meeting with designated representative of Egyptian Government regardless of rank. Realize this may be impossible present situation in Israel, but it seems to me that there enough logic in Egypt’s position to cause effort to be made. I see no possibility of convincing <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> that Israeli position is not merely irrelevant attempt to gain political advantage at his expense. Furthermore, while Israeli position <pb xml:id="pg_237" n="237" facs="0265"/>may be politically understandable from their domestic viewpoint, do not believe it can be sustained as essential to success of talks.<note n="3" xml:id="d122fn3">The Embassy in Cairo reported on June 10 that Lieutenant Colonel Gohar had been instructed to deliver the following message to General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName>: 1) Egypt was willing to conduct high-level talks with Israel to consider <persName>Burns</persName>’ four proposals regarding steps to preserve security around the Gaza Strip and to examine Egypt’s proposal for the establishment of a neutral zone along the demarcation line, and 2) the ranking Egyptian representative at these sessions was to be Lieutenant Colonel Gohar.

He said we might have to disagree but he never again wished to have strained relations with me personally.</p>
                        <p>Despite friendly atmosphere conversation disturbing. Because of urgency report re Gaza situation sent separately.<note n="2" xml:id="d123fn2">See <hi rend="italic">supra.</hi>
                            </note> Remainder of summary follows in three sections.</p>
                        <p rend="center">I.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> and I were able to agree upon general policy objectives in Middle East. He wishes Middle East spared from Communism and wants to see adequate defense against Russian overt or covert activity. He wishes build stronger Egypt and does not wish war with Israel which may mean his destruction and stoppage his plans for a better Egypt. On tactics we could not agree and I told him frankly Egypt’s position today was one of spreading disruption throughout Middle East… . Continuation of bad relations between Egypt and Iraq benefited no one. If he felt he in stronger bargaining position as regards the West with a block of Arab states behind him, he <pb xml:id="pg_238" n="238" facs="0266"/>basically wrong. … He stated he did not know honestly whether <gloss target="#t_ESS1">ESS</gloss> pact would ever be accomplished. He agreed situation in Syria dangerous. He agreed with long range dangers of Egypt’s policy but stated we seemed to ignore his short range dangers re Israel. Re Egypt-Iraq relations, he had suffered extreme insult while at Bandung to receive letter from Iraqis quoting “conditions” he must meet for them to stop Radio Free Egypt. He did not start either this series or the present tenseness with Israel. He would not be humiliated either by Israel or Iraq.</p>
                        <p rend="center">II.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> repeated to me his feeling of personal guilt at deaths of his soldiers in Gaza. He had been led by Israeli contacts and to some extent by US into complacency that Israel really wanted a settlement. He had ended Hakim American [<hi rend="italic">
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGAH1">Hakim Amer</persName>’s</hi>] funds for army. He had himself told officers that he believed there was good chance of making better arrangements with Israel and that he was taking funds from military for economic development. Under these conditions the Gaza February 28 raid left him in almost impossible position. He would not and could not issue orders that troops could not defend themselves if they had reason to believe approaching Israeli vehicles were intent upon attack. It was for this reason he said that he had suggested separating the troops.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> spoke with discouragement of his belief during past three years that military equipment could be obtained from the US. Realized he had not been willing to sign military aid agreement but could not understand why we unable to increase economic aid funds or take some other measure which would allow Egypt be able to purchase equipment from us with its own funds. This after all was what happened with Israel. She had obtained funds from the US, Germany and elsewhere which enabled her to buy equipment to keep her armed forces in top condition. He stated that as a matter of principle as contrasted to available funds he was able to buy equipment from every nation except the US. He had concluded that he should accept Russia’s offer of military equipment and plans to send a mission there next week. I responded that surely he would not put himself in a position of depending upon Soviet spare parts and ammunition and that he must realize the long range implications of such a move. Refuted his contention that he had been denied right of purchase US arms but even so he had stated could buy from Britain, France, etc., so why turn to Russia? He replied that in his view if Israel really started a war the Western powers would again boycott the Arab world as they did before, but still let Israel obtain equipment. Although Russian motive undoubtedly dangerous in long <pb xml:id="pg_239" n="239" facs="0267"/>run to Middle East, Russians at least would not blockade Arab world attempt to get arms. Department can imagine my response to stupidity of his position. It included, however, categorical statement that if Israel started war, US would not embargo Arab states and leave Israel free to obtain support. (In this connection, heard yesterday <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had received report from <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName> stating his view US would not act under tripartite declaration if major aggression started by Israel. This is only rumor here but if true this may be cause of <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s mood.) It only logical for any reader this message consider this aspect of conversation attempt by <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> to threaten us into supplying equipment. Do not believe this the case. He speaking his conclusions and convictions however illogical and dangerous they may appear to us.</p>
                        <p>In this connection was approached last week through indirect channels as to whether US policy prohibited Egypt buying any arms from America. Did not choose to give reply through channel used. Last night <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> talked to me at some length about problem, stating <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> really wished to know our position. I reviewed history of matter over last three years. He said, nevertheless, would I find out now whether Egypt could now purchase under previously signed 408E agreement.<note n="3" xml:id="d123fn3">On December 9 and 10, 1952, Prime Minister of Egypt at that time, General Mohammed Naguib, and then U.S. Ambassador Jefferson Caffery, exchanged formal notes to bring into force a Mutual Defense Assistance Understanding under Section 408 (e) of the Mutual Defense Assistance Act of 1949 (64 Stat. 373) and the Mutual Security Act of 1951 (65 Stat. 373). For texts of these notes, see TIAS No. 3565, printed in 7 UST 844.</note> We understood there would be limitations upon amount and type. Nevertheless, as matter of principle, he thought it important that they know.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> today took position we had denied purchase of equipment by Egypt. I told him I thought this was not correct. He asked if I would determine Washington policy. I reminded him of recent approval of British equipment and asked what specifically he had in mind. He said he could not go into types and quantities at the moment but merely wished principle defined. I told him types and quantities might well affect the principle. He said he not thinking in big terms but wished to know whether under present conditions we would deny Egypt the right of purchase.</p>
                        <p>Regret putting this question to Department under present conditions but felt I could not refuse <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s request that I ascertain Washington’s views. If he has large amounts equipment in mind, suppose both US policy and Egyptian financial status would prohibit. On other hand, if he thinking of modest expenditure which would not really affect situation would regret outright refusal in principle which would only drive him to deeper gloom and feeling <pb xml:id="pg_240" n="240" facs="0268"/>we really with Israel when the chips are down. Request instructions.<note n="4" xml:id="d123fn4">See <ref target="#d132fn2">footnote 2, Document 132</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p rend="center">III.</p>
                        <p>While this may sound inconsistent, <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> talked with sincerity of his desire to be friends with America. He felt it still possible and that we should continue talking until we see whether something might evolve that could get us back in step. He took my extremely strong criticism Egypt’s policies calmly and without sign of hostility but gave impression of person fully convinced he acting in best short range interests of Egypt. At present moment it clear he would pull down temple on top of regime rather than suffer what he considers humiliation and pressures upon him, particularly from Israel. This is indeed a dangerous and most unfortunate situation, particularly as I completely convinced there no desire here to have war with Israel.</p>
                        <p>Can only hope this talk may produce some moderation. Can conceive of no pressure that will have desired effect upon <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>. Believe only power we have is one of persuasion and personal contact which shall try do utmost. Difficulty in dealings with this fellow is that he honestly agrees with our criticism and dangers of Egypt’s policies in long run yet seems convinced he must move as he does in the short run.</p>
                        <p>Request Department repeat portions or entire message as desired other capitals.</p>

He referred sadly to fact that “whole thing has fizzled out.” But I did not take that to mean that matter had come to an end without talks on Gohar level. I urged that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> not reject idea solely on basis of lower level military talks than he had anticipated and referred to topsy-turvey military hierarchy with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> a Lieutenant Colonel only and with many junior officers possessing much more power than general officers. I also referred to expectation that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> would grant Gohar wide powers—much wider than in past conversations between Gohar and Israeli officers. Furthermore, I underlined understanding that Gohar had always reported direct to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> thus bringing conversations closer by direct line to high level. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> listened, but rather scorned idea that Gohar would have much real authority and would have to refer back to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> frequently. I did not press point, but commented as in our last conversation, on net gain which might come from any discussions of broad problems of border tensions, even at proposed military level. Although he made no comment I was encouraged by fact he gave no indication Gohar level talks would be rejected. However, he did not know at that time of Egyptian restrictive agenda proposal.<note n="4" xml:id="d124fn4">See <ref target="#d122fn3">footnote 3, Document 122</ref>.</note>

                        <p>The situation in Gaza continues extremely tense and there is a strong possibility that the high level talks for which we, the British, the French and General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> have been pressing will not eventuate.</p>
                        <p>General <persName>Burns</persName> has indicated his intention to apprise the Security Council of the situation, and the question may well come up for discussion there. On June 7 Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>, who is chairman of the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> this month, formally advised his colleagues on the Council of the dangers of the situation and indicated that the Council might well have to take up the matter once again.<note n="3" xml:id="d125fn3">For text of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>’s letter of June 7 as President of the Security Council to the members of the Council, see U.N. doc. <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>/3406.</note>

                        <p>We have applied strong pressure on the Egyptians to participate in such talks on a basis acceptable to Israel but the outcome of our efforts looks rather dubious. It is quite possible that should the talks not take place the Israelis will maintain that the situation in Gaza requires strong military action. You will note from the attached telegram (Tab B)<note n="4" xml:id="d125fn4">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LEB1">Lawson</persName> informed the Department of State that he had spoken with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> at his home on the afternoon of June 1. In the course of this conversation, <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> indicated to <persName corresp="#p_LEB1">Lawson</persName> that unless the United Sates, the United Kingdom, and the U.N. Truce Supervision Organization were able to prevail upon the Egyptians to stop shooting at Israelis inside Israeli territory and to take other measures to reduce tension along the border, the people of Israel would soon reach the point, he believed, where they would say “to hell with them [the Egyptians], let’s move into the Gaza Strip and get it over with. Let’s drive the Egyptians into the desert.” (Telegram 1010 from Tel Aviv, June 1; Department of State, Central Files, 674.84A/ 6–155)</note> that the Israel Prime Minister has intimated that Israel might be pushed into a position whereby she had no course but to “move into the Gaza Strip and get it over with …. drive the Egyptians into the desert.”<note n="5" xml:id="d125fn5">Ellipsis in the source text.</note>
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5428 provides that if an armed attack occurs, the U.S. should take certain steps to deal with the situation, including discontinuance of U.S. aid to the aggressor, an embargo of trade and the freezing of funds (See Tab C). <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> also <pb xml:id="pg_243" n="243" facs="0271"/>provides that at a time and in a way deemed appropriate the courses of action set forth therein should be made known to Israel and individual Arab states privately.</p>
                        <p>An <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> Working Party has been set up to look into specific actions which this Government must take to implement the policy set forth in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> document.</p>
                        <p>The British Embassy has informed us as follows:</p>
                        <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> thinks it desirable that Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> should be reminded that the Tripartite Declaration means something. He accordingly wishes to suggest that the Three Powers should now make joint representations to both the Israeli and Egyptian Governments expressing concern at the present dangerous tension on the Gaza border and reminding them that under the Tripartite Declaration, the Three Powers would be bound to take action against an aggressor. Moreover it is clear that the situation in the Gaza salient is very explosive and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> thinks we should consider whether, in addition to the warning proposed above, some move of forces in the Mediterranean is required to indicate that we mean business. So far as Her Majesty’s Forces are concerned H.M.G. could for example at short notice move an aircraft carrier to the Eastern Mediterranean. This should prove an effective way of reassuring Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> of our serious intentions. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> would be grateful for the U.S. Government’s views and to know whether they would contemplate any similar action.</p>
                        <p>“In the meantime, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> is proposing to make a suitable reference to the Tripartite Declaration and H.M.G.’s obligations under it in the House of Commons in the course of the foreign affairs debate on Wednesday June 15.”<note n="6" xml:id="d125fn6">No copy of this communication has been found in Department of State files.

We are dubious as to the wisdom of a show of military force as the opening gesture on the part of the Tripartite powers. For one thing, a naval demonstration on the part of the great powers against small countries could redound to our discredit for a considerable period. For another, in his Independence Day speech, Israel Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> stated that a British attempt to force a peace on Israel would be carried out only after a <pb xml:id="pg_244" n="244" facs="0272"/>bloody war between the two countries… .

                        <p>1.

                        <p>2. That our Ambassadors in Cairo and Tel Aviv be instructed, in collaboration with their British and French colleagues, to express our grave concern over the situation.</p>
                        <p>3. That our Ambassadors in Cairo and Tel Aviv be authorized in their discretion to convey to the Prime Ministers of Egypt and Israel the measures which this Government would take (“a” thru “d” of Para 10 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5428) in the event of either an Egyptian or Israel aggressive attack against the other party.<note n="8" xml:id="d125fn8">

                        <p>10. If in the opinion of the U.S. an armed attack occurs, the U.S. should be prepared to take the following steps either simultaneously or in stages:</p>
                        <p>a. Discontinue U.S. Government aid to the aggressor.</p>
                        <p>b. Embargo trade between the U.S. and the aggressor.</p>
                        <p>c. Prevent the transfer of funds from any source in the U.S. to the aggressor directly or indirectly.</p>
                        <p>d. Urge other countries, as appropriate, to take similar measures.</p>
                        <p>e. In the event none of the above courses of action are successful in causing the aggressor state to desist from armed attack and to withdraw within its own borders, consult (without prior commitment) with the U.K., and to the extent practicable with other powers, on whether to take concerted action to:</p>
                        <p>(1) Establish a blockade of the attacking state.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_245" n="245" facs="0273"/>
                        <p>(2) Use military forces to compel the attacking state to relinquish any territory seized and to withdraw within its own borders.</p>
                        <p>f. Make every effort at the outset to secure <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> sanction and support for the above measures; but, if it appears that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action will not be forthcoming promptly, be prepared in an urgent situation to take such measures without delay.</p>
                        <p>11. In collaboration with the U.K., and to the extent desirable and feasible with France and Turkey, develop plans, including military plans as appropriate, to support the measures in paragraph 10 above.</p>
                        <p>12. At a time and in a way deemed appropriate, make the policy in paragraph 10 above known to Israel and individual Arab states privately.</p>
                        <p>13. As appropriate, enlist Congressional support for the measures in paragraphs 10 and 12 above.</p>

                        <p>I told the President that the situation around the Gaza neutralized strip was serious; that the Israeli were massing forces there and that there was some evidence that they might move in and take over the whole of this strip, driving out the Egyptians.<note n="2" xml:id="d126fn2">According to telegram MAI 693 from the U.S. Army Attaché in Tel Aviv, June 7, an Israeli source informed him that day “that he personally believes <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> to overrun Gaza strip without notice and he is certain his top superior believes same. Bases his feeling on truculence Israeli civilians and military; the political advantages accruing to <gloss target="#t_Mapai1">MAPAI</gloss> party; irredentist claims to strip and desire colonize there; getting rid refugees whose headlong flight would impede Egypt army def or counter atk and not discounting value to <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> as practice alone, as well as opportunity for glory. Believes however another incident necessary as excuse. He estimates two days at most to accomplish. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> I concur his beliefs.” (Department of State, <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> Files: Lot 59 D 518, Alpha—Memos, etc., beginning after 2d London Talks—April 26–June 30, ’55)</note> I said that the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> paper<note n="3" xml:id="d126fn3">Reference is to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5428; see <ref target="#d126fn2">footnote 2</ref>, <hi rend="italic">supra.</hi>
                            </note> contemplated that in the event of action of this sort, the United States might unilaterally take economic sanction, including cutting off remittances of funds to Israel. I expressed the view that we should try, if possible, to get the United Nations recommendations <pb xml:id="pg_246" n="246" facs="0274"/>in the matter rather than act unilaterally. The President agreed with this point of view and suggested that <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> could take this up with the United Nations and try to get appropriate action by the Security Council. I said there was always the problem of the veto, but that I thought that as things were now going, if the action were against Israel, the Soviets would probably concur in it but not vice versa. The President thought it particularly important that the finding as to who was at fault should be made by the United Nations and that we should not take that responsibility alone. I said that General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> was watching the situation closely and would probably be in a position to make a quick report to the Security Council.<note n="4" xml:id="d126fn4">According to a June 15 memorandum for the files by <persName corresp="#p_BJW1">Barco</persName>, <persName>Dulles</persName> discussed this with <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> upon his arrival in New York later that day. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> then telephoned Hammarskjold, informed him of the U.S. concern with developments in the Gaza area, and requested that the U.N. Secretariat be prepared for a meeting of the Security Council in San Francisco during the Tenth Anniversary Meeting of the signing of the U.N. Charter. He told <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName> that time might be of the essence and urged that if such a meeting should prove necessary, a full report from <persName>Burns</persName> should be ready for it. <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName> telephoned <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> later to say that he had issued the necessary instructions to <persName>Burns</persName>. (Department of State, <gloss target="#t_UNP1">UNP</gloss> Files: Lot 58 D 224, Palestine) <persName corresp="#p_BJW1">Barco</persName> recorded in a June 16 memorandum for the files that <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName> had informed him by telephone that <persName>Burns</persName> was prepared to report immediately in the event of an attack.

                        </p>
                        <p>The President also said that while he thought we should in general adhere to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> policy paper on the subject, he thought that, in the first instance, we should limit ourselves to suspending governmental aid and hold back on interrupting private transmittals of funds as a second step, if the first step did not work.</p>

                        <p>A brief meeting was held after luncheon on June 16 to discuss the Gaza strip situation and its relation to the Security Council. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> described the present situation as tense. He referred to the <persName>Burns</persName> report after the January incident<note n="2" xml:id="d127fn2">Presumably reference is to the Gaza incident of February 28.</note> and the letter which he had circulated to the Security Council members a week or so ago.<note n="3" xml:id="d127fn3">Reference is to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>’s letter of June 7. For text, see U.N. doc. <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>/3406.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that there were intelligence indications that the Israeli were massing. The Security Council might be able to take some action which would deter hostilities, or, failing that, it then might make recommendations based on a report from General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> which would call on member governments to impose economic sanctions. The United States would then be prepared to suspend governmental aid to Israel which it would not consider itself in a position to do except in response to some call from the Security Council.</p>
                        <p>There was some discussion as to a public announcement that the Security Council was prepared to meet in San Francisco next week if the situation deteriorated.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said that on Tuesday he had called in separately the Egyptian and Israeli Ambassadors in London. He had earnestly <pb xml:id="pg_248" n="248" facs="0276"/>asked them to meet in full the four points of General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName>’ recommendation, but he had not yet had a reply from either. He said that he had solemnly reaffirmed the Tripartite Declaration in the House of Commons yesterday.<note n="4" xml:id="d127fn4">For text of <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>’s remarks, see <hi rend="italic">Parliamentary Debates,</hi> House of Commons, 5th Series, vol. 542, cols. 596–600.</note> He recognized the desirability, in the event of a major outbreak, of securing some form of Security Council action which would in effect support tripartite action.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary again pointed out that we have a constitutional problem in connection with action under the Tripartite Declaration and said the essential thing was that any action under that Declaration be specifically linked with action by the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>After some further discussion, it was agreed that the Security Council should be prepared to meet immediately in the event of the situation worsening and that it would be in a position to meet if necessary in San Francisco.</p>
                        <p>The three Permanent Representatives to the United Nations were then requested to withdraw and to consider (1) what further publicity, if any, should be given to the possible meeting of the Security Council in San Francisco and (2) what types of sanctions might be employed against the aggressor in the event of an outbreak of hostilities in the Gaza strip.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>At the meeting of the Permanent Representatives it was agreed first that the President of the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>, should let the press know that he had alerted the Secretariat to the possibility that a Security Council meeting might be necessary in San Francisco. It was also agreed that the President should not issue a statement to be quoted.</p>
                        <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_DSPJ1">Pierson Dixon</persName> felt that the question to be decided was (a) what should the three governments do if Israel attacked in the Gaza <pb xml:id="pg_250" n="250" facs="0278"/>area, and (b) what the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> should do. Under (a) he felt that it was a question of what might be done to take preventive action. He said that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> wanted joint action under the Three-Power Declaration of 1950.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> pointed out the desirability of having <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action to back up any three-power initiative.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Hoppenot said that he felt that the course of action in the Security Council in the event of serious trouble in the Gaza area should be (1) an immediate report from General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName>, (2) the issuance of a cease-fire by the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>, (3) a call by the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> for Israel to withdraw from the area occupied and (4) pressures on Israel to enforce compliance. Under (4), there were two aspects (a) should the terms of the pressures be fixed by the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> or (b) should it be left to the Members to choose what pressures they should apply?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> pointed out that we, the US, would want to have the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> indicate the lines of action as much as possible. He agreed with Sir <persName corresp="#p_DSPJ1">Pierson Dixon</persName> that it was not yet the time to think of intervention in the Palestine situation with troops. The possibility of aid to one of the countries concerned being cut off remained, but we would need as specific instructions from the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> as possible without, of course, having our hands tied. Ambassador Hoppenot suggested that this might be done by having the Council, if it met after an attack in the Gaza area, ask all Member States of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to “abstain from assistance to the aggressor”. He felt that this was something that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could not veto. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> made clear and Hoppenot and <persName>Dixon</persName> agreed, that if such line were used it would leave open to Governments to cut off government aid, but that it should not imply that private aid should be cut off. It was also agreed that the Council should call upon countries in the area to exercise the greatest restraint to avoid an intervention by the other Arab states. It was also agreed that the Permanent Representatives should recommend to the Foreign Ministers that it would be desirable to tell the parties what we had in mind doing in the Security Council in the event of an attack. This might have a deterrent effect. The Permanent Representatives agreed that an attack by Israel would be a threat to the peace and would require action under Article 7.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ramsbotham was requested to draw up a recommendation for the Foreign Ministers comprising the above points to be submitted after consulting with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WGE1">Wadsworth</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ramsbotham drew up a statement based on the above and this was presented to the three principals at the end of their afternoon meeting.<note n="2" xml:id="d129fn2">No copy of the original draft statement has been found in Department of State files. For final text of the agreed statement, see <ref target="#d131">Document 131</ref>.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> questioned the wording of some <pb xml:id="pg_251" n="251" facs="0279"/>of the paragraphs but was generally satisfied except that he reacted against the suggestion that <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> action should include the call upon other states aimed at deterring other Arab intervention. Reason was not clearly given, but since meeting was then breaking up it was decided to postpone decision until morning session. M. <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> made no particular comment.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Francis Russell</persName> called on Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Eric Johnston</persName> at the Motion Picture Association, 9:15 a.m., June 17, 1955 to brief Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> as to the Department’s current thinking on Near Eastern problems. I was the only other person present.</p>
                        <p>After a brief discussion of recent events in the area, particularly the increased tension between Israel and Egypt along the Gaza strip, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> commented that the Department had, as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> knew, been examining for some time a number of possible means to end the unsatisfactory situation that existed in the Near East. Since about last August, members of the Department’s staff had been considering various aspects of the problem, he said, always with the understanding that no steps should be taken which would interfere with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>’s negotiations. He pointed out that the Secretary and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> had both been careful in all their discussions with the Israelis to state that the settlement of the water issue should precede consideration of other major steps, which the U.S. might take respecting the area. He added that he had been asked a few months ago by the Secretary to assist in pulling together the elements of a possible settlement, for inclusion in a public statement on the Near Eastern question, and that he had been in consultation with the British on the matter.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> asked what the current thinking was as to the components of a settlement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> replied that, while the <pb xml:id="pg_252" n="252" facs="0280"/>details were still under consideration, certain principles must clearly be a part of any settlement. The difficult day-to-day friction between Israel and the Arab states occurred along the borders and, as Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> knew, Israel had been pressing for a security guarantee of its boundaries. The United States obviously could not participate in any guarantee of boundaries, however, unless these were defined. Thus, a settlement of the border question was an essential part of any general settlement.</p>
                        <p>The Palestine refugee problem, was another major source of area tension; hence the special attention given to Jordan Valley development through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>’s negotiations. In a general settlement, further steps would be necessary to settle the claims of the refugees for property now in Israel hands, so arrangements for the payment of compensation would also be required. In response to questions by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> confirmed that a resolution of the Jerusalem issue was envisaged as a part of the settlement, and that the Department was thinking in terms of treaty arrangements between the United States and each interested Near Eastern nation.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> said that he would like to express his views on the subject, as one who had been in close contact with the area, even though the Department had already doubtless considered the ideas he had in mind. He then explained that a reaffirmation and strengthening of the Tripartite Declaration of 1950 for a specific period of time would, in his view, help to lessen area tensions and provide a period in which a more comprehensive settlement could be reached. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> said that there were two considerations which raised doubt as to the value of using the Tripartite Declaration. First, the Israelis had already informed us that no such action would meet their needs; they wanted a document which would bear their signature as well as that of the U.S. Second, it is very likely that a situation would arise where the peace of the area would be seriously disturbed but where it would be impossible to ascertain with certainty which side was at fault. It would then be difficult for the United States to know what steps should be taken. When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> commented that the latter would be true even in the case of a treaty, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> agreed that a problem existed but pointed out that the obligations would be assumed in the latter case only after a number of steps had been taken to reduce tension—thus decreasing the possibility that any sanctions need be applied.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> contended that a basic difficulty would still not be overcome. He said that it would take a long time under the most favorable conditions to develop the proposed treaty arrangements— eighteen months would, he said, be a conservative estimate even if the negotiations were to follow a successful resolution of the water <pb xml:id="pg_253" n="253" facs="0281"/>issue. Meanwhile, he asked, how would tensions be relieved if an interim step is not taken to stabilize the situation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> replied that there was considerable doubt whether the U.S. would find itself willing to become further involved in the area until after it was assured that the steps he had mentioned had been taken. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> felt, however, that the U.S. would necessarily be involved in any major eruption in the area, regardless of the formal position, and that to refrain from strengthening the Tripartite commitment would only leave people in doubt as to our intentions and exacerbate the present unsatisfactory position. He added that by placing a time limit on the Tripartite reaffirmation, pressure could be placed on the parties to come to a more general agreement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> that he would very much appreciate having an opportunity to discuss the entire question with the Secretary and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> before any statement is made. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> assured him that he would be kept informed and would pass on his desire for a full discussion of the problem.</p>

                        <p>The three Permanent Delegates to the United Nations met at 3:15 p.m. on June 16 to consider the following two questions referred to them by the three Foreign Ministers.</p>
                        <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Whether the President of the Security Council should issue some immediate warning that the Security Council may meet in San Francisco</hi>.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed to recommend that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>, as President of the Security Council in June, should take steps to see that his letter of June 16 (S/3406) was kept before the public, and to indicate that the <pb xml:id="pg_254" n="254" facs="0282"/>United Nations Secretariat had been warned of the possibility of a meeting in San Francisco in case of an emergency.</p>
                        <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">In the event of one of the parties committing an overt aggression, what action would we wish the Security Council to take?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>[It was noted that there was a prior question which was outside the jurisdiction of the Permanent Representatives and which was still under discussion between governments viz: whether a tripartite warning should be made to the Israeli and Egyptian Governments re-affirming the intention of the three powers to act upon the Tripartite Declaration.]<note n="2" xml:id="d131fn2">All brackets are in the source text.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>It was agreed that, in the event of an overt aggression by one of the parties, involving an invasion across the Gaza Strip, the Security Council should be called at once and should be moved to take the following action under the terms of Chapter Roman seven of the Charter:</p>
                        <p>(a) Call for an urgent report from General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName>;</p>
                        <p>(b) Call for a cease-fire;</p>
                        <p>(c) Indicate which party was the aggressor;</p>
                        <p>(d) Call upon the aggressing state to withdraw its troops;</p>
                        <p>(e) Call upon all <hi rend="italic">member governments</hi> to refrain from all aid to the aggressor.</p>
                        <p>[A broad formula of this kind would be advisable as we would not wish the Council to call, in terms, on the three powers to take measures to restore the situation. The formula suggested would, however, permit us to apply economic sanctions without stopping all trade with the country concerned.]</p>
                        <p>It was further recommended that consideration should be given to whether we should warn the parties concerned in advance of the action contemplated in the Security Council in the event of aggression.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">End verbatim text</hi>.</p>

                        <p>1928. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> asked me last night if I had received decision on principle of whether Egypt could purchase arms in U.S. I replied I had not and pointed out that he must realize his request had had to be put to Washington in most unfortunate light.</p>
                        <p>In long discussion which followed, <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> made clear that he was still aware of long range disadvantages of Soviet arms aid. However, partly for morale effect in army and partly for security of Egypt, he still felt desperate need to obtain additional supplies of military equipment which would continue in event of trouble and therefore still seemed discount unfavorable impression acceptance Soviet arms would make.</p>
                        <p>He also tended discount effect Soviet aid would have within Egypt itself. For example, he insisted he could make deal whereby no Russians were allowed inside Egypt and under which no signed agreement would be necessary. I told him effects would come later and in form he would not like. In my opinion Egypt was important target for <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Soviets probably would ask nothing more initially than show of real neutrality and be content with effect that would have upon Middle East as a whole. Second phase would come later when he might find himself incapable of coping with it. He replied he felt communism in Egypt could be controlled and asked if I knew of his action a few hours earlier in jailing Communist leaders. I said I did not but history was full of examples of leaders who felt they could play only so far with Communist and then cut off relationships.</p>
                        <p>During discussion <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> retreated somewhat from his previous categorical statement that he intended obtain arms from <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. (We know that he has held up dispatch of mission to Moscow.)</p>
                        <p>He asked me several times what I thought answer from Washington would be. I told him I did not know but I thought he had presented his request in most difficult form possible by seeking decision in principle without giving ideas as to items or quantity. Department alone could not decide this question and military certainly would be unable consider such a vague request.</p>
                        <p>Hope Department will give most careful consideration to reply which I am to make to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>. Point at issue in my opinion is not whether <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> can persuade West to supply arms failing which he <pb xml:id="pg_256" n="256" facs="0284"/>will turn to <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>—in fact believe decision should be based upon other factors pushing possible <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> deal aside. I believe <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> feels he is posing test of U.S. good faith and intentions toward Egypt in its current concern regarding Israel. Therefore present issue is whether as matter of principle Egypt is or is not barred from purchasing military equipment in U.S. If at this time we give <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> answer that as matter of principle Egypt is denied right of purchase of arms in U.S., believe we shall be very long time getting over effect that will be created. Regardless of facts of past history this matter, Egyptian officers (<persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> included) generally believe it has been impossible for Egypt purchase arms in U.S. If at this time of urgent need, as they see it, when we both know Egypt is far weaker than Israel, we turn Egypt down on question of principle, <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> and his supporters will not soon forget our action which they will interpret as being totally partial to Israel.</p>
                        <p>I therefore recommend Department authorize me reply that U.S. has no policy which would bar Egypt from purchasing equipment. It seems to me unnecessary to go beyond this statement unless and until <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> is prepared specify requirements in practical terms. As Egyptian financial resources are obviously limited, I would expect that in any event Egyptian purchases of equipment could not be large.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> has said that he wishes me to inform him as soon as I receive Department’s views.<note n="2" xml:id="d132fn2">The Department, in telegram 2214 to Cairo, June 17, authorized <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> to inform <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> that Egypt was eligible to purchase arms in the United States under the terms of the Mutual Defense Assistance Understanding of December 1952, that the United States would consider any request solely on its merits and within the framework of the principles embodied in the Tripartite Declaration, and that it would consider sympathetically those requests that involved reasonable expenditures.

                        <p>1069. At Prime Minister’s request that I call at his residence in Jerusalem today (<hi rend="italic">Shabot</hi>) on an urgent matter I visited him at twelve noon. He was considerably agitated saying “yesterday was a day of shock.” He referred to <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>’s proposed meeting of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> in San Francisco for purpose of discussing (as Prime Minister termed it) the Gaza strip situation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> was visibly upset for fear that meeting was being called on basis of rumor that “Israel has massed troops and arms on Gaza border with intention of making aggressive move into Gaza, probably during <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> meeting in San Francisco.” He said this was fantastic story which he feared may have been sold to <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and other <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> members by Arabs. He was afraid that <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> meeting might well result in “Israel being hauled before bar on a completely false charge—that whatever resolution came out of meeting the edge of sword would be aimed toward Israel to its unfair disadvantage.” He wished to place this matter immediately before me denying categorically veracity of story and requested that I inform Department without delay. This I agreed to do.</p>
                        <p>In exchange of comment, I made following points:</p>
                        <p>1. He should be certain that <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> was not in any possible way vulnerable to charge. He assured me that it was not and that there was no plan whatever for aggressive use of arms on border.</p>
                        <p>2. That I felt sure that <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> would not condemn Israel unjustly on basis of unconfirmed rumor—this seemed to me axiomatic; but in view of situation, admitting that border had been relatively quiet for several weeks, there were several unsettled problems which General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> was trying to solve and thus a firm resolution calling attention of both Egypt and Israel to March 30 resolution of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> would seem a reasonable action. After some argument, he admitted logic involved but said most important incomplete item was failure of Egypt to follow <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> instructions to carry out high level talks despite continued pressure by General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName>, the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. In this connection, he said General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> told him yesterday there was still no agreement by Egypt but that Gohar was taking to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>
                            <persName>Burns</persName>’ arguments for talks at a level higher than Gohar,<note n="2" xml:id="d133fn2">
                                <persName>Burns</persName> met with Gohar on June 16. Telegram 365 from Jerusalem, June 18, reported <persName>Burns</persName>’ account of the meeting, as he had described it to <persName corresp="#p_CWEJ1">Cole</persName>. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 674.84A/ 6–1855)</note> and a reply was expected Monday June 20. Therefore, he thought it might be effective <pb xml:id="pg_258" n="258" facs="0286"/>if US again urged <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> to accede to such a program and should make approach now to coincide with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s consideration of <persName>Burns</persName>’ recommendations. I informed him I would pass on his suggestion to the Department.</p>
                        <p>3. That it was common knowledge that <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> had long been in a position to defend itself on border but I had seen no evidence of a recent build up of military strength in that area for an aggression to coincide with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> meeting in San Francisco. (He gave me impression that <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>’s proposal may have stemmed from Embassy reports although he did not make direct charge. He did remark “I am confident that had you believed situation described to be true, you would have come to me and asked for confirmation.” In any event, he made it clear that he did not want Israel to be charged with threatening aggressive action, referring again to substantial period of time without incident on border.)</p>
                        <p>In subsequent comment, he thought any <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> action at this time would conflict with efforts now being made by <persName>Burns</persName> to solve outstanding problems and would come just at time Israel had come out with its firm proposals for reducing border tension (see immediately following telegram<note n="3" xml:id="d133fn3">
                                <hi rend="italic">Infra</hi>.</note>), which proposals would form part of agenda for proposed Israel–Egypt talks. He thought that <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> action should be postponed until these efforts were exhausted, especially in view of border quietness. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Although Embassy agrees with <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> to extent he was speaking of absence of large-scale mobilization, evidence available indicates recent active maneuvers in Negev area. As reported <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1067,<note n="4" xml:id="d133fn4">In telegram 1067, June 18, the Embassy in Tel Aviv reported that the U.S. Army Attaché had concluded that the Israeli troop movements in the northern Negev were nothing other than large-scale maneuvers. Although the Embassy recognized that the Israelis could use such exercises as a springboard for military action, it had concluded that the evidence available indicated that the Israeli Cabinet had taken no decision at that time to permit large-scale military action against the Egyptians. (Department of State, Central Files, 674.84A/6–1855)</note> Embassy believes immediate crisis has passed, due largely three weeks period without Israel casualties along border and apparent willingness to await results <persName>Burns</persName> negotiations.</p>

He told me that had been outlined to <persName>Burns</persName> and would appear in week-end press. They were:</p>
                        <p>1. Cancellation by Egypt of standing orders to its troops to fire on Israelis.</p>
                        <p>2. Establish a narrow border zone within which there would be mine fields along parallel wire fences on Egyptian and Israeli sides. Zone would straddle existing line.</p>
                        <p>3. Operation of joint patrols on a central clear path within narrow, mined, border zone.</p>
                        <p>4. Establishment of effective local commander’s agreement with it specifically agreed that telephonic communications exist between those commanders.</p>
                        <p>He said that Egyptians could introduce other proposals but he thought Israel’s proposals would obviate the “demilitarized” zone idea of <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>, and would at same time prevent opening up of border area to unlimited infiltration as permitted by that proposal.</p>
                        <p>He thought move by Israel was a constructive one and supported his argument that a San Francisco <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> meeting was not now necessary and would prove more confusing than effective in circumstances.<note n="2" xml:id="d134fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> reported on June 22 that he had asked <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> earlier that day for his view about these latest Israeli proposals. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> stated that, with the exception of the first point, he believed they were really a variation of his own and <persName>Burns</persName>7 suggestions.

                        <p>Embassy Cairo’s previous report states <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> said “that he had concluded he should accept Russia’s offer of military equipment and plans to send a mission there next week.”<note n="3" xml:id="d136fn3">Reference is to <ref target="#d123">Document 123</ref>.</note> A subsequent telegram reported that the dispatch of the mission had been delayed.<note n="4" xml:id="d136fn4">Reference is to <ref target="#d132">Document 132</ref>.</note> We have no other information from the Embassy regarding the current Russian offer.

                        <p>In February 1954 the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> offered, through an Egyptian economic mission then in Moscow, assistance in construction of the High Aswan Dam. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>, however, did not accept this offer because of fear of Russia’s real intentions… . Soviet Ambassador Daniil S. Solod offered technical and economic assistance, including financing for the High Aswan Dam, on May 23, 1955 and added that if Egypt objected to the presence of Soviet personnel in Egypt, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would work through the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> declined the offer but inquired whether the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would barter heavy artillery for cotton. Solod replied affirmatively and indicated shipment might be made within six weeks… . <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> has designated Major-General Hassan Raghib to head a mission to the Soviet Union to negotiate <pb xml:id="pg_262" n="262" facs="0290"/>the purchase of artillery items offered for barter against cotton… . According to <gloss target="#t_DRS1">DRS</gloss>, the arrangement, if finalized, will be the first sale of arms by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> outside the Soviet bloc since World War II.</p>
                        <p>… Czechoslovakia has offered immediate delivery of an unspecified number of military planes in exchange for cotton.</p>
                        <p>In May 1954 the Embassy in Cairo reported a noticeable increase in Russian overt activity on the commercial, diplomatic, cultural and propaganda fronts. The present Russian Ambassador arrived in Egypt in October 1953. In December 1954 the Soviet was reportedly attempting to increase its cultural influence in Egypt, and plans for opening a “Cultural House” in Cairo received Egyptian approval in April 1955. In that month Egypt announced approval of Soviet and Roumanian offers to supply petroleum products worth $8.4 million against Egyptian cotton. The agreement, similar to one signed last year, is causing concern to American and British oil companies operating in Egypt. You will recall that during the Bandung Conference, Egypt and Communist China were reported to be discussing a trade arrangement involving an exchange of cotton. Since March 1954, the Hungarians, East Germans and Czechs have conducted well-publicized trade fairs in Egypt. The fairs were apparently conducted mainly for propaganda reasons, since no appreciable increase in trade followed.</p>

                        <p>1953. Information contained first paragraph <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 2214<note n="2" xml:id="d137fn2">See <ref target="#d132fn2">footnote 2, Document 132</ref>.</note> conveyed <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> this morning. He thanked me for information but in general gave impression he did not believe we would find ourselves able to let him buy any significant amounts of equipment from US. He spoke at some length about apparent inability of tripartite powers to let Egypt become as strong as Israel. In this connection he was particularly critical of French who [he] says have supplied rather large quantities of tanks to Israel. Yet when delivery date came for previously arranged deliveries of same type of tanks to Egypt they <pb xml:id="pg_263" n="263" facs="0291"/>had demurred saying Egypt’s North African policy primarily responsible.</p>
                        <p>I felt it best not to encourage <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> as to amounts of equipment he might be able to obtain from US as must avoid creating expectations which probably would not be forthcoming. I did say I believed, however, he would be able to purchase from the West in general the armaments that he would find himself financially able to purchase on commercial basis.</p>
                        <p>I would expect that Egyptian Embassy Washington will follow through this interview with specific requests. I told him this best way handle matter although there would be advantage our knowing here what requests they were putting to Washington.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary greeted Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> cordially and expressed pleasure at the opportunity of having a discussion with him. Commenting that relations between the United States and Egypt seemed to be slightly less cordial than they have been a few months ago, the Secretary said he regretted this development very genuinely since he had always felt that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> was the most promising of the Arab leaders and that Egypt was the logical leader of the Arab States. He asked Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> what he thought the reasons were for <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s reservations about the United States.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_264" n="264" facs="0292"/>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> said that relations between the United States and Egypt had reached their high point at the time of the signing of the Suez Canal Agreement, but that Egypt had been shocked by the signature of the Iraqi-Turkish Pact. Additional adherence to this pact by other Arab States would make matters worse. The Secretary pointed out that the United States had been given too much credit for bringing about this pact and that he himself had been quite surprised when it occurred. He said that as long ago as June 1953, he had originally used the term “northern tier” as a concept for a collective security arrangement to include the countries between Turkey and Pakistan and that we welcomed any proper step in this direction, but any idea that we were building up Iraq as a counterweight to Egypt among the Arab States had no justification whatever.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> said he was now satisfied that the United States was not “interfering in Syria”, but any impression that we supported the adherence of other Arab States to the Turkish-Iraq Pact would create further uncertainties in Egypt with regard to American policy. The Secretary said that far from urging such adherences, we would be embarrassed if they did join since the effect would be bad not only in Egypt but also in Israel. In the latter connection, he asked Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> how Israeli-Egyptian relations stood. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> said these fell into two categories, the immediate and the long range. As regards the immediate, the problem concerned the Gaza strip. Egypt had agreed to General <persName>Burns</persName>’ proposals for discussions with Israel and Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had suggested a neutralized zone along the Gaza frontier and arrangements for joint Israeli-Egyptian patrols as possible means for improvement. He hoped these suggestions would bear fruit.</p>
                        <p>As regards the long-range question, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> said Egypt’s position was quite straight forward and clear. He did not wish to imply that this was a matter which had been thrashed out in the Egyptian cabinet, since only he and Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had discussed the matter, but he had let Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> know their basic attitude. He said <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had two requirements which must be fulfilled before any long-range settlement with Israel could be possible. The first requirement was full material compensation for the losses sustained by the refugees. He emphasized material compensation since, he said, no one could estimate the moral and psychological damage done to these uprooted people. Egypt did not insist that the compensation be paid by Israel, but full compensation was required from some source in order to enable these people to begin a new life, either in Israel for those permitted to return, or elsewhere for those who were not. The second requirement was the physical and geographical union of the Arab States. This meant the surrender <pb xml:id="pg_265" n="265" facs="0293"/>of the Negev, “including Beersheba”, by Israel. Egypt did not demand an inch of this territory for herself. It could all be given to Jordan. Moreover, Israel could have Gaza. He said that one often heard reference to the partition of Palestine, but the creation of Israel had in fact partitioned the Arab States, by separating them physically. If he wished to go by car from Egypt to Damascus, he would have to obtain the permission of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>. This was an impossible situation for any Arab to accept. A mere corridor would in no way suffice.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked that he had not made any basic statement regarding United States policy toward the Middle East since his return from that area two years ago.<note n="2" xml:id="d138fn2">For documentation on the visit of <persName>Dulles</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Harold Stassen</persName> to the Near and Middle East, May 9–29, 1953, see <ref target="frus1952-54v09p1">

For text of <persName>Dulles</persName>’ speech of June 1, 1953, which summarized his trip, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, June 15, 1953, p. 831.</note> Prior to the United States Congressional elections last year, he had been subjected to considerable pressure to make a further statement but he had refused to do so, promising a statement after the elections. Eight months had passed and he now felt that he should not wait much longer to do so.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> said he presumed that the reason the Secretary felt a statement necessary was the request he understood Israel had made for a security pact with the United States. He pointed out that a security pact must guarantee certain boundaries; he asked what we proposed to guarantee. Until boundaries were fixed, he did not see how any pact was possible. If the United States signed a security pact with Israel under present circumstances, before boundaries had been agreed upon by the Arab States, the pact would be illegal and he would protest it as such. Moreover, the United States would do irreparable harm to its relations with every Arab State, without exception, if we gave Israel a security pact prior to a permanent boundary settlement. The Secretary commented that, as a lawyer, he was not always impressed by legal arguments but he understood fully the political considerations Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> mentioned.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> said he thought efforts for a definitive settlement should be made during 1955 since the United States would find it difficult, “for obvious reasons”, to do anything during 1956. Consequently, if progress was not made during 1955, we might have to wait until 1957. The Secretary commented that even 1957 might not be an easy year since positions might be taken by both sides during the 1956 political campaign which would be difficult to overcome.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> said that if the two basic conditions regarding refugees and boundaries were met, he saw no reason why the matter <pb xml:id="pg_266" n="266" facs="0294"/>should not go ahead in the near future. The Secretary expressed his appreciation for this encouraging news and repeated his pleasure at the opportunity to discuss the subject with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> in San Francisco.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 674.84A/6–2855) He reported in telegram 375, June 25, that <persName>Burns</persName> had informed the Israelis that Gohar had been named the Egyptian representative with full authority to discuss and agree to subjects forming the agenda. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 674.84A/6–2555)</note> postponed until next week owing “technical difficulties” in drafting agenda.

He was not willing have Israelis three points (Tel Aviv’s 1070 to Department<note n="3" xml:id="d140fn3">
                                <ref target="#d134">Document 134</ref>.</note>) also included in agenda. Gohar indicated he was ready talk about latter provided they were not set forth in agenda itself. Israelis maintained that they should not be put in an inferior position with respect preparation agenda and therefore would not accept Gohar’s position. <persName>Burns</persName> considered Israeli viewpoint as logical and made number of efforts reconcile differences and achieve formula regarding agenda agreeable both parties. In so doing he proposed some seven different possibilities none of which acceptable to Gohar.</p>
                        <p>In view complete rigidity Gohar’s position, <persName>Burns</persName> mentioned to Gohar his opinion that latter given no authority deviate from fixed instructions. Gohar replied to effect he had authority but did not wish “deviate” owing “question of principle” which caused him adhere his fixed position.</p>

                            <persName>Burns</persName> told me he assumes Gohar attitude dictated by necessities Egyptian internal politics, thus involving forces he is not well able to assess. Meeting June 29 adjourned on understanding it would be resumed about July 6 if some progress could be made toward agreement on agenda. <persName>Burns</persName> said he is not optimistic about prospects and will not call future meeting unless they show considerable improvement meanwhile.</p>
                        <p>I also discussed subject with Vigier, who generally takes pessimistic view such matters. He referred to idea he had expressed earlier (<gloss target="#t_mytel1">mytel</gloss> 331<note n="4" xml:id="d140fn4">Not printed. (Department of State, Central Files, 674.84A/5–2555)</note>) to effect Egyptians would yield to pressures <pb xml:id="pg_268" n="268" facs="0296"/>favoring holding talks Gaza situation merely to forestall Israeli propaganda which could result from their refusal. He thought that this had in fact occurred and that Egyptians had no discernible intention of making real progress toward bettering situation through such talks. Vigier regards virtual breakdown talks as potentially dangerous, since in face Egyptian intransigence Israelis may again resume “provocative” patrols, etc., and be more inclined than previously retaliate against any interference.</p>

                        <p>After two months of discussion centered largely on the one issue of whether the proposed Engineering Board will have the unequivocal right to use 300 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">mcm</gloss> of storage capacity in Lake Tiberias, if necessary to irrigate the lower Jordan Valley, the Israelis have advised us that they concede the point. We have informed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>, who is now in Los Angeles, by telegram.</p>
                        <p>We now hope to concentrate on the following points:</p>
                        <p>(1) The right of the watermaster to unimpeded access to all points on the watercourse. We do not intend to insist that he have the right to issue directives, but we believe he must be able to move freely for the purposes of inspecting and maintaining records.</p>
                        <p>(2) The right of the Arabs to withdraw the Yarmuk River water they store in Lake Tiberias, as and when they wish.</p>
                        <p>(3) The construction of the outlet facilities from Lake Tiberias to Point JX (i.e., the point where the irrigation system begins in Jordan), immediately after an understanding is reached with both sides. We are inclined to believe that these facilities should be built all at one time, of a capacity adequate to serve the system when it <pb xml:id="pg_269" n="269" facs="0297"/>conveys Yarmuk waters stored in Lake Tiberias as well as the agreed flow from the upper Jordan River.<note n="2" xml:id="d141fn2">The Department also provided the information contained in this memorandum to the Embassy in Tel Aviv.

                        </list>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRW1">Bailey</persName> said the British Government, at the working level, had been preparing contingent plans for action if the Egyptian-Israeli tensions degenerated into open conflict. They had worked out specific actions to be taken to apply both economic and military sanctions.<note n="2" xml:id="d142fn2">The British Embassy submitted a memorandum dated June 28 to the Department of State entitled “Economic Sanctions which might be applied against Israel in the event of Israel launching a major attack against Egypt” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 684A.86/6–2855), but no British document dealing with military sanctions has been found in Department of State files.</note> He recalled in this connection Britain’s special obligations to Jordan and the likelihood that Jordan would become involved if there were fighting between Israel and Egypt.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRW1">Bailey</persName> emphasized that the planning which had been done had not been submitted to the Cabinet and could not be considered, therefore, as having governmental approval. He thought it desirable, however, to exchange ideas on this subject with us, it being understood that such exchanges will be strictly informal. He knew that the Department of State had been doing some preliminary thinking about means to be employed to put economic sanctions into effect and he therefore proposed to talk to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dorsey</persName> of <gloss target="#t_NE1">NE</gloss> on this subject. He thought it would also be useful to discuss possible military actions. The British Chiefs of Staff would hope for American cooperation if it became necessary to impose military sanctions, <pb xml:id="pg_270" n="270" facs="0298"/>and were of the opinion that United States action could best take the form of providing a task force of aircraft carriers and amphibious troops. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRW1">Bailey</persName> added that he understood his Government thought it would be well to have such naval forces moved to the eastern Mediterranean in advance of an outbreak of hostilities, to serve as a deterrent.</p>
                        <p>I replied that I thought it would be desirable to exchange notes with respect to the question of economic sanctions. I pointed out, however, that the Secretary felt quite strongly that the U.S. Government should not impose such sanctions except within the framework of some <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action against the aggressor. He had already explained to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> the legal and political difficulties which we would face in taking action unless we had the blessing of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the sending of a task force to the eastern Mediterranean to act as a deterrent, I recalled that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRW1">Bailey</persName> had passed this suggestion to me some weeks ago. I had discussed it with the top officers of the Department and had found a general reluctance to take this action. I did not know of any consideration which had been given in the U.S. Government to the use of military force in the event of an outbreak of fighting in Palestine. I rather thought we would be extremely reluctant to come to that point and would certainly hope that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action plus economic sanctions would be sufficient to meet any situation which might arise. I was afraid, therefore, that any discussions we might have with respect to the military aspect would be very one-sided, with the British doing all the talking. I would, however, explore this question further.</p>

Since then they have been in process preparing list (contained in immediately following message)<note n="2" xml:id="d143fn2">
                                <hi rend="italic">Infra</hi>.</note> which I received morning July 1. <pb xml:id="pg_271" n="271" facs="0299"/>Am merely acknowledging receipt of communication with indication that it will be submitted Washington. Do not plan any comment or discussion here prior to receipt advice from Department.</p>
                        <p>… this Embassy has attempted analysis of effect in Egypt, in general Middle East area including Israel, and on position of US versus Soviet bloc of various types of US response. Based upon this type analysis, and mindful of Department’s position on principle already conveyed <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> in compliance Department telegram 2214,<note n="3" xml:id="d143fn3">See <ref target="#d132fn2">footnote 2, Document 132</ref>.</note> recommend US Government give favorable consideration Government of Egypt request and facilitate shipment as much as possible. Am not unaware that substantial purchases by Government of Egypt at this time will be most difficult domestically, but in making this recommendation am guided by following:</p>
                        <p>a. Necessity as I see it for US to take at this time some affirmative step halt growing belief on part Government of Egypt that identity of short term interest in foreign and economic fields exist only between Government of Egypt and Soviet bloc.</p>
                        <p>b. Fact that Egyptian officers, almost without exception, believe US has in fact denied Egypt opportunity to purchase weapons. This would be judged in context regime’s exaggerated idea value US friendship in terms military and economic aid in early days their friendship with US. This real factor for consideration when <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> depends upon support of military in his general policies.</p>
                        <p>c. Conviction that, with general mood of desperation re Egyptian stability since February disruption of Gaza, <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> has feeling he has no alternative than to obtain arms from some source in order keep confidence of military. Egyptian officers now know they have been offered arms for cotton by Russia. If they now informed effort was made with US and that we failed follow through or quibbled or delayed in response, majority would probably welcome Government of Egypt arrangements for arms with Soviets.</p>
                        <p>d. Fact that I am convinced Egypt has no intention to, nor sees no profit from, initiating hostilities. In any case added equipment would not give Egypt capability carry out successful aggressive action against Israel based on information available service attachés here.</p>
                        <p>e. Fact that, although some items on list have had bad psychological implications, list is not unreasonable from point view of adequate defense against Israel and would, even if obtained in entirety, leave Egypt considerably weaker than Israel. (In this connection when I spoke of tripartite declaration with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> in complying Department telegram 2214 he reminded me that declaration sanctions armed forces for legitimate self defense. This he says he does not have and even if we do have good intentions, Israelis could destroy Government of Egypt military and probably topple him <pb xml:id="pg_272" n="272" facs="0300"/>before we could interfere. This is a tough one to answer when our own information made it appear as if Israel might do just that only a month ago.)</p>
                        <p>f. Fact that introduction Soviet arms in area will have great impact upon Middle East generally and strengthen opportunities for Soviet bloc in other endeavors. Even Israel, our own problem in connection with all this, should certainly be even more concerned than if arms purchased in US which certain to exercise continuing influence their use and logistic support.</p>
                        <p>Go-betweens who have in past been helpful and who seem genuinely concerned over trend US-Egyptian relations past few months, strongly stress that quick and affirmative handling this request will go far reestablish <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> confidence in US intentions toward Egypt. Cannot promise this would happen but believe chances are at least even this could be the case. On other hand, if we take opposite course results far easier to predict. Such action on our part will, I believe, be used to “clarify the record” and result in increased Soviet political penetration of Egypt and thence Arab world. We must remember that Egypt is certain continue to be real influence this total area, whether for good or bad.</p>
                        <p>Am sending as third cable this series summary of the pattern of Communist bloc activities here in Egypt.<note n="4" xml:id="d143fn4">
                                <ref target="#d145">Document 145</ref>.</note> Am concerned, however, more by apparent flexibility in case of operations of Soviet and satellite representatives than I am with facts and statistics given that message. You will note that we do not see indication of greatly increased Communist bloc political and subversive activity in Egypt itself during past few months. Nevertheless, am convinced that bloc’s position in Arab states has greatly improved during this period. Believe this in large part consequence skillful method of operations employed by bloc representatives in taking advantage local opportunities caused by disruption and friction in area. In addition Soviets have natural advantage in that situation permits them to move in on Egypt under guise of legitimate trading interest and thus avoid arousing unduly Egypt’s fear of political penetration.</p>
                        <p>Our enemies are ready to do business on spur of moment, flatter local officials and make every effort to please whether requests seem designed for efficiency and real benefit or not. As example, Soviet Ambassador volunteered to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> help on high dam. No surveys or attachment of conditions (such as necessity agreement on Nile waters, et cetera) involved. He also offered economic development funds. Both were refused. When <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> said how about some guns for cotton in same conversation, it is reliably reported Soviet Ambassador took list of available equipment from his pocket with prices indicated, and stated delivery could be made <pb xml:id="pg_273" n="273" facs="0301"/>within six weeks with payment in cotton. Other interesting examples involving <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> procurement from Hungary of locomotives which it originally intended to obtain with US aid will be sent separately.</p>
                        <p>If decision is to try affirmatively meet greater part of requirements, there will be great benefits here by acting quickly. If local attaché information correct, it would appear that bulk of heavy items requested are World War II vintage believed to be readily available and at reduced prices.</p>
                        <p>As to procedures, should think Egyptian Ambassador and attaches Washington should handle arrangements with Department and Pentagon. Would hope avoid necessity in this commercial deal, under existing 408 e agreement,<note n="5" xml:id="d143fn5">Section 408(e) of the Mutual Defense Assistance Act of 1949, which became Public Law 329 on October 6, 1949, enabled the President to transfer or to sell equipment, materials, or services to a nation which had joined the United States in a collective defense or regional arrangement.

                        <p>12. Following summarizes pattern of Communist bloc activity in Egypt.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Political</hi>. Communist bloc states now enjoy great political advantage in Egypt as compared US since their public position agrees with that of <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> and most of its supporters on vital issues of Turk-Iraqi pact and all “western-sponsored” defense alliances, Zionism and Israel, “colonialism”, and Egypt’s policy of “independence”. Furthermore no split on issue of wide public interest seems exist between Egypt and Communist bloc.</p>
                        <p>During past two years Communist bloc states have more than doubled size their missions in Egypt, opened several new offices, and now appear to be planning to open liaison office Khartoum. Pattern of blocs general political activity in Egypt, however, has not changed significantly this period. In particular no evidence exists that bloc has made serious attempt unite splintered Egyptian Communist movement although subversive activities among minorities continue on small scale.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Economic</hi>. In contrast, Communist bloc has made every effort maximize commercial ties with Egypt from which it has reaped considerable political advantage. Bloc has increased cotton purchases 66% above last season and figure likely go much higher if projected exchange with Communist China can be worked out. Communist bloc also actively interested in Egyptian rice which, like cotton, suffering heavily from depressed world market for which Egyptians blame US surplus disposal programs (present or “contemplated”). Communist bloc, in exchange for cotton and rice, is offering petroleum and industrial equipment at favorable prices including locomotives and is carrying on very intensive trade promotion through trade fairs and delegations. Egyptians have welcomed Communist trade offers. Apparently convinced American agricultural policy will continue unfavorably affect their previous markets in Western Europe, <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> making every effort establish new markets in only available area i.e. Communist bloc.</p>
                        <p>Soviets have also offered “assistance” to Egypt on high dam project. In this case however Egyptians have been wary, probably because they are doubtful of Soviet ability follow through and so prefer not cut themselves off prematurely from possible western <pb xml:id="pg_276" n="276" facs="0304"/>financing. If <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and or other forms of western financing fail materialize, Soviet offer, if renewed, may appear more interesting.</p>
                        <p>Communist bloc has also concluded series payment agreements with Sudan Government with tacit consent of Governor General who considers “foreign affairs” not involved.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Cultural</hi>. Communist bloc has carried on active cultural program which has been particularly successful in promoting visits of Egyptians to Communist areas and in penetrating press circles. Latter is relatively easy since by and large Communist and crypto-Communist journalists are highly qualified professionally and write well and to the liking of many of regimes supporters on subjects such as foreign and economic policy.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Psychological</hi>. Present world wide conciliatory attitude of Communist bloc has also helped produce feeling on part <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> that in addition economic necessities, short run advantages of dealing with Soviets may outweigh long range disadvantages. Additional factors are awareness weakness local Communist movement and pervading suspicion of western intentions toward Egypt as <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> becomes increasingly persuaded that divergencies between its foreign policy objectives and those of the US unlikely to be resolved in Egypt’s favor in near future.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Conclusion</hi>: <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> remains opposed local Communist political activities and is vaguely aware of long-term dangers closer relations with Communist bloc. Nevertheless, I believe <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss>, which sees no evidence recent increase bloc political and subversive activity in Egypt and appears convinced trade with bloc probably absolute necessity in absence concrete evidence to contrary, is prepared accept risks involved.</p>

He enclosed copies of the draft statement and requested their comments. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi>

Will inform Department by separate message reasons why I believe such a statement will be counter-productive in Middle East generally. Will also forward such comments as we have on text, although these relatively unimportant if decision actually made to proceed with that type statement.</p>
                        <p>I hope you will not conclude that you personally should make statement containing suggested methods of settlement of Arab-Israeli matters. I say this because I do not like to look forward to extreme criticism of you personally which I am certain would follow. This I believe would be case in Middle East generally regardless of how reasonable statement might be in your eyes or of well-intentioned motivation. Things are not going well out here as you know but I retain conviction expressed to you prior my departure that our greatest asset in Arab world is feeling that both you and the President personally are trying be fair and just. I fear if statement made by you increasing and vicious propaganda will do much to change this regard for highest level officials our administration.</p>

                        <p>During the past week, we made more progress in our discussions with the Israelis than during the entire period since our return from the Near East. You will recall that the Israelis had earlier accepted the minimum position on quantities set forth by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>—the position he feels obligated to try on the Arabs. We have now obtained the understandings we desired on the following issues:</p>
                        <p>1. The proposed Engineering Board will make its decision as to whether Lake Tiberias is to be used as a reservoir for Yarmuk flood flows on the basis of need in the lower Jordan Valley.</p>
                        <p>2. The Engineering Board will be empowered to obtain from Israel up to 75 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">mcm</gloss> of additional water until the decision is made on Lake Tiberias storage of flood flows.</p>
                        <p>3. The Watermaster will have free access to all points on the watercourse.<note n="2" xml:id="d147fn2">These understandings were incorporated into the text of a “Draft Memorandum of Understanding” that the American and Israeli representatives accepted on July 5. The text of this memorandum is <hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi>
                                <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss>/IAI Files: Lot 70 D 254, Framework of the Fourth Mission—No. 19 (April 22, 1955– )</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Three issues remain to be resolved. The first two arise in part, at least, from differing evaluations of the engineering facts, and we have asked our engineers to make the necessary analysis for us. We hope to obtain it by July 14. The third issue requires an Executive Branch decision which, in turn, must await a recommendation from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>.</p>
                        <p>1. Whether the Arabs will be permitted to withdraw Yarmuk flood waters stored in Tiberias as and when they wish.</p>
                        <p>2. Whether facilities will be constructed south of Tiberias, immediately on reaching an Arab-Israel understanding, adequate to serve the system when Tiberias is used to store Yarmuk water.</p>
                        <p>3. In what manner and amount aid will be extended to Israel in connection with the program.</p>
                        <p>Assuming we come to a satisfactory understanding with the Israelis on these three points, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> feels obligated to return to the area. However, the indications we have of sentiment on the Arab side are, if anything, even less propitious than before. The <pb xml:id="pg_279" n="279" facs="0307"/>situation in Syria shows still fewer constructive elements—if such a thing is possible—and the position of the Lebanese Government is deteriorating. The Government in Jordan is probably slightly stronger (its downfall is no longer predicted daily), but at best it cannot approach the Abol Huda Government of last winter for leadership on this issue.</p>

                        <p>6. General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> has told me that Israel press stories of July 7 and 8 constitute good factual account of last two Gaza meetings. According Tekoah’s recent statements to press, which source such accounts, Egyptian and Israeli representatives agreed tentatively to certain proposals which comprise: (1) strict measures to prevent civilians crossing D/<gloss target="#t_L1">L</gloss>; (2) provisions for return of persons crossing <pb xml:id="pg_281" n="281" facs="0309"/>D/<gloss target="#t_L1">L</gloss>; (3) only trained police or soldiers to man forward posts and conduct patrols.</p>
                        <p>Areas of disagreement (with Egypt taking negative stand) are said to have been as follows: (1) direct telephone communications between local commanders; (2) acknowledgment of an obligation to return stolen property carried across the D/<gloss target="#t_L1">L</gloss>; (3) frequent meetings of local commanders; (4) exchange of information concerning punishment of persons attempting to cross the D/<gloss target="#t_L1">L</gloss> illegally; (5) settlement of minor incidents by local commanders without resort to <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> procedures.</p>
                        <p>Gilroy, <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> correspondent, has reported that Tekoah described meeting as “tough going.” He said that while Israel wants to reach agreement on best measures for reducing tensions on frontier Egypt is on guard against anything indicative of real cooperation. Tekoah expressed view that the Egyptian attitude is opposed to going beyond the present security arrangements. Egyptians thus sought to accomplish the minimum possible through the talks.</p>
                        <p>In commenting on foregoing press accounts, General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> told me July 8 Gohar is certainly trying to reduce any commitments to a minimum. However, Gohar said to <persName>Burns</persName> July 6 “I hope you don’t find me deliberately obstructive now!” <persName>Burns</persName> added that Gohar evidently had instructions to be less difficult than at opening meetings, but that he is still very formalistic and pedantic in his approach, if not now “obstructive.”</p>
                        <p>Regarding settlement minor incidents outside <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> procedures, Gohar maintained that subcommittee of <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> already capable of handling such incidents.</p>
                        <p>With reference local commanders agreement, or “arrangements,” <persName>Burns</persName> explained that Gohar insists Major Sedki (Egyptian <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> representative) act as local commander for Egyptians, although the Officer with authority to take action is Brigadier Aghroudi, in command of military Gaza area. <persName>Burns</persName> said Sedki has no authority over troops and would not prove effective. On contrary he would merely have to refer all matters to the Brigadier. This subject is to be considered further next meeting. Meanwhile, <persName>Burns</persName> is trying work out compromise. <persName>Burns</persName> also seeking obtain compromise on question direct telephone communications between commanders which would involve using <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> observer as intermediary. Understand Egyptians would probably agree such expedient.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Burns</persName> said that while facts given out by Tekoah are substantially correct, he considered unwarranted impression conveyed by Tekoah that owing to Egyptian obstruction no satisfactory agreement can be reached on outstanding points in future discussions. …</p>
                        <p>To summarize, <persName>Burns</persName> added that Gohar has at least agreed in principle to his four points. Gohar remains afraid, however, of any <pb xml:id="pg_282" n="282" facs="0310"/>measures which might prove unpopular with Egyptian military. <persName>Burns</persName> expressed view that he thought it would be well for powers to avoid any further pressures on Egypt with regard talks at least for time being. If, however, diplomatic representatives found opportunity to mention informally, for instance, the possible detriment to Gaza proceedings of controversial statements for the press, that might prove helpful. Also he had no objection if they could let it be known casually that he is still finding Gohar “a bit sticky.” <persName>Burns</persName> said that (in the light of Gonads evident aim to achieve a minimum of accomplishment) his own efforts to get something done doubtless made him appear “pro-Israeli” to the Egyptians. For that reason <persName>Burns</persName> exercised more restraint than usual in conducting most recent meetings.</p>

                        <p>53. Eyes only Ambassador. From the Secretary. I believe that is unavoidable that we soon make some statement of US policy toward the Israel-Arab problem. We have made no policy statement for over two years. During the Congressional elections, we said we would not do so because we felt sure that whatever we said would be tinged by politics, but we promised action soon afterwards. Now nine months have gone by since our October promises in that respect. If many more months go by, we will be in a worse position politically than during the Congressional elections. Inevitably, statements will be made on both political sides, and I don’t see how it is possible to prevent those statements having a very grave effect upon future relations. Therefore, it seems to me that a reasonably comprehensive statement should be made now which will represent the position to which the Administration, and I hope the Opposition, would adhere during the 1956 elections.</p>

                        <p>I have been struck by the fact that <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> shares the view that we should this year seek an overall solution of Arab-Israel problems. He told me that at San Francisco.<note n="2" xml:id="d150fn2">See <ref target="#d138">Document 138</ref>.</note> He has repeated it here in Washington.<note n="3" xml:id="d150fn3">The Secretary had met again with <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> on July 7. (Memorandum of conversation, by <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dorsey</persName>; Department of State, Central Files, 684A.86A/7–755)</note> He emphasizes three points: There should not be a security treaty with Israel before there is an overall settlement, and he then prefers a “declaration” to a treaty. He believes there should be adequate compensation for the property losses of the refugees, and he believes that there should be an adjustment in the Negev which would reunite the Arab world. His expressed idea of such adjustments is greatly exaggerated, but I would not expect less from an initial statement of trading position. He sought American financial help for High Dam, and when I indicated this would be more easy after Israeli settlement, he said he understood our position. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> from London indicates that despite earlier misgivings about public Alpha statement by me in the near future, British now inclined to believe under all circumstances, this probably a desirable step, and I expect to discuss this with <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> in Paris.</p>
                        <p>I believe my two talks with <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> are such that he will believe that what I say has been influenced by his own judgment and that this may mitigate ill reception. Probably, there can be similar talks with <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> and possibly some Jewish leaders here with like result.</p>
                        <p>While therefore I recognize that both Jews and Arabs will as first reaction be publicly negative and critical, this will probably subside, and even if negotiations along the lines suggested do not soon get underway, we will have charted a course which is basically sound and to which we can perhaps hold during our national elections.</p>
                        <p>I suspect that any announcement may have a negative effect upon <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>’s plan, but his effort has been going on now for two years and I see no prospect of consummation within another year or more. Therefore, I am not inclined to hold off on this account. However, I shall discuss this with <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> on Monday.<note n="4" xml:id="d150fn4">See <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>.</note>

                                <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> stated in a July 6 memorandum to <persName>Dulles</persName> that, in accordance with the latter’s instructions, <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> had telephoned <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> in Spokane, Washington, and informed him that <persName>Dulles</persName> planned to make a public statement around August 15 presenting a program for a general Near Eastern settlement and that he hoped <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> would be able to return to the Near East before July 28. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> expressed concern at this decision and subsequently requested an opportunity to talk to <persName>Dulles</persName> by telephone to attempt to dissuade him from it. <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName>’s memorandum stated that <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> was expected to argue that if his negotiations were successful, the Arabs would regard such a public statement as a “double cross.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 684A.86/7–655) No record of such a telephone conversation has been found. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>’s views are further discussed in a letter of July 7 from Troxel to <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName>. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 684A.86/7–755)</note> The Secretary replied that he planned to comment on the explosive potentialities of the Arab-Israel situation and to indicate that if progress were made on such major matters as compensation for the refugees and border rectifications, including a land connection between Egypt and Jordan, that the U.S. would be prepared to assist by providing a loan to help Israel pay compensation and by extending a security guaranty of the borders agreed upon.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> urged forcefully that the Secretary postpone a decision on whether or not to make a public statement until Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>’s return from his impending trip to the area. He stated he would be back by August 25, at the latest, and possibly as early as August 15. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> thought the Arab-Israel problem should be approached from an economic standpoint and not a political one, because none of the Arab leaders would feel able to ask their people to accept a political settlement. He maintained that success in the Jordan Valley negotiations might well open the way to a solution of the entire problem. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> reported that considerable progress <pb xml:id="pg_285" n="285" facs="0313"/>had been made recently with Israel, and he estimated his chances of obtaining agreement in principle during his next trip at about 50–50. However, if the Secretary were to make his planned statement, prospects for the Jordan Valley negotiations would be destroyed.</p>
                        <p>In reply the Secretary explained that he felt obliged to make a definitive statement of U.S. policy towards the area before the 1956 election campaign started. If he failed to chart out a specific course now, the issue would inevitably become enmeshed in domestic politics. The results could be severe damage to the U.S. position in the area as a whole. Israel was exerting strong pressure to secure a security guarantee, and we had been delaying since October 1954. It was impossible to continue doing so much longer. The Secretary pointed out that, according to his reports, agreement was unlikely during Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>’s next trip. Even if agreement in principle were reached, the details still would have to be worked out, which would require a long time. It would be logical for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> to ask for a further delay in order that the final negotiations might be completed. The three or four weeks delay now requested was not critical, but he foresaw that it would be only the first of a series of additional delays. The Secretary mentioned that the British were thinking of making a statement before Commons rose on July 27.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of the discussion the Secretary agreed not to make a public statement himself before August 25, but added that he could not say whether the British would do so. The Secretary said that in preparing the statement, he would take into consideration, of course, the results of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>’s trip. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> expressed pleasure at the decision and gave the Secretary categorical assurances that he would not request any further delay in the issuance of a public statement.<note n="3" xml:id="d151fn3">
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> informed <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> the following day that, in light of <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>’s assurances that “he had obtained sufficient agreement from Israel on Jordan water plan to justify 50–50 expectation of obtaining concurrence of Arab States during his visit Middle East at end of July”, he had “reluctantly agreed” to refrain from making his public statement before August 25, and he asked <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> to request a similar postponement by the British.

                        <p>61. Department eyes only Secretary. London eyes only Ambassador and <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName>. Have received your personal message regarding motivation for policy statement in near future on Arab-Israeli problem<note n="2" xml:id="d152fn2">See <ref target="#d150">Document 150</ref>.</note> and want you to know I fully appreciate domestic reasons for statement which indeed important and convincing.</p>
                        <p>It had been my hope some way could be found meet situation that did not include public specific recommendations by United States as to how elements Arab-Israeli problem might be solved. Feeling you would wish me point out after effects in area as I see them sent letter July 7 to <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">George Allen</persName> which hope you can find time read.<note n="3" xml:id="d152fn3">No copy of this letter has been found in Department of State files.</note> (For information London: One of main points letter was my belief that these particular recommendations which we call Alpha and which have been carefully worked out to best our ability, may well have to be discarded after public launching in search of other methods of solution which, in some cases at least, probably do not exist from practical point of view. It seemed to me that Arab leaders would not place themselves in position of attempting meet public suggestions made by United States on this particular problem.)</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName>’s statements to you quite similar those made to me and reported in past but must caution that <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> is not representative of Arab mood and mentality on this question and is not in position of responsibility this matter even in Egypt. He can be helpful but will not be in position to mitigate ill reception of statement.</p>
                        <p>Hope Department will give United States and other posts in area as much advance notice of delivery as possible so that we in best position do what we can follow through.</p>

                        <p>141. From <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName>. As reported telegram 86<note n="2" xml:id="d153fn2">
                                <ref target="#d148">Document 148</ref>.</note> there is present disposition on part of <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> recognize impelling reasons for Secretary to make an early statement on Israel-Arab problem. British have expressed gratification that ideas in Secretary’s draft statement are those which have been worked out in Alpha. As following telegram<note n="3" xml:id="d153fn3">
                                <hi rend="italic">Infra</hi>.</note> indicates we have been engaged in formulating specific measures to be taken preparatory and subsequent to proposed statements by Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>.</p>
                        <p>British anxieties with respect to effect of proposed statements on governments and public in Middle East and specifically in Iraq and Jordan, however, remain. <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> points out that there is a risk of the following repercussions in respect of which the British have particular responsibility: (1) visibility of grave disturbances in the refugee camps leading to border troubles in Gaza or along Jordan frontier involving the British treaty with Jordan and Arab legion; (2) possible violent reaction of disappointment on the part of a new and perhaps extremist Israeli Government leading again to involvement of Jordan; and (3) what concerns them mostly is reaction from Nuri and the Arab world generally which would destroy progress to date on northern tier and even lose the British their treaty position in Iraq. At worst Nuri might be overthrown in a wave of public indignation against a policy of cooperation with the West. If estimates from area pointed to such developments, they would in British opinion have to be regarded as overriding.</p>
                        <p>In order to obtain most accurate possible appraisal, <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> is sending Geoffrey Arthur to Baghdad (arriving Thursday morning and reporting directly to <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> in Paris) to talk with British Ambassador there and later with British Ambassador Amman.</p>
                        <p>Possibility suggested from discussion this morning that there are two steps which U.S. might take which would bear heavily toward favorable reaction on part of Nuri: (1) decision to provide Iraq through off-shore procurement with small number Centurion tanks along lines recently discussed in Washington, and (2) statement to Nuri that U.S. continues support Turco-Iraqi pact and that while present state of Israel-Arab relations prevents U.S. adherence to pact, <pb xml:id="pg_288" n="288" facs="0316"/>if settlement were worked out along lines Secretary will propose, U.S. adherence might be contemplated. If decision could be made on these two points it would not only minimize danger of an explosive Iraqi opposition to proposals but would greatly relieve <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> concern re position in Iraq and Jordan.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> will probably raise these points with Secretary at Paris.</p>

                        <p>142. From <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName>. Subject to considerations mentioned preceding telegram following has been agreed with Foreign Office: (1) text of statement to be made by Secretary, with only minor revisions in draft prepared by him; (2) that <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> (or if he on vacation, the Foreign Office) would make rather full statement to press day following Secretary’s statement showing joint nature of proposals and elaborating certain points of special concern to <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>; (3) that British and American Chiefs of Mission Cairo, Tel Aviv, Amman, Damascus, Beirut, and Baghdad<note n="2" xml:id="d154fn2">The British Chiefs of Mission were, respectively, Sir Ralph <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Stevenson</persName>, J. W. Nicholls, C. B. Duke, Sir John Gardener, Sir Edwin Chapman-Andrews, and Sir Michael Wright; the American Chiefs of Mission were, respectively, <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Henry A.

Foreign Office proposed to send it air pouch closing Friday evening subject to decision at meeting between Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> in Paris. In view of delays in US air pouch service to area I suggest Department authorize me, subject to results Paris meeting, send memo with brief covering letter to US Mission Chiefs at 6 posts in question, through Foreign Office pouch.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Begin summary proposed memorandum</hi>.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_289" n="289" facs="0317"/>
                        <p>Foreign Office and Department agreed on need for equitable settlement and best means attempting achieve it. Intention had been approach <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> first but this not possible. Secretary convinced he cannot refrain much longer from defining policy US administration toward Israel’s security and Middle East as a whole. Longer he waits more difficult it will become for him make balanced statement on subject; should therefore soon make statement, to which US administration could hold firmly. It our hope that parties to dispute even though they may vigorously reject proposal at first will in long run come see its merits and move slowly toward it. On other hand we not blind to grave risks entailed.</p>
                        <p>Memorandum encloses copy of draft of speech which Secretary would deliver probably on Thursday August 18, containing outline of possible settlement. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> intends give full support to Secretary’s proposals, possibly at press conference, day after publication and express <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> readiness help in bringing about settlement and make financial contribution.</p>
                        <p>We will avoid being drawn into publishing any fuller details of proposals as this would prejudice any later negotiations. Guidance for publicity will be sent later, meanwhile following explanations of specific points may be useful:</p>
                        <p>(a) <hi rend="italic">Guarantees</hi>: It intended these be limited to territorial aspect of settlement. Will be made clear however that guarantees will not be granted except in framework of actual comprehensive settlement, in other words mere acceptance by one party of part or all plan would not earn guarantee.</p>
                        <p>(b) <hi rend="italic">Boundaries</hi>: (1) Restoration of land to Arab border villages: this should be interpreted flexibly. To restore all such lands would not be possible as Israel would be almost cut in two. On other hand problem must be solved if settlement to endure. A sort of solution which in our minds will be equitable has in fact been worked out but we want avoid any specific mention of these ideas to parties until they can be induced to engage in serious discussion of a settlement.</p>
                        <p>(2) Road from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem: would entail cession to Israel of part of Latrun Salient and surrounding no man’s land.</p>
                        <p>(3) Negev: Principle underlying this solution is there would be a point at junction of two triangles where sovereignty would appertain both sides or possibly neither. This would make it possible for east-west Arab road under complete Arab control pass over (or under) Israeli north-south road under complete Israeli control. No other way reconcile vital interests of both parties in Negev. We should not commit ourselves on size and location of triangles which left for negotiation although we have various alternative ideas.</p>
                        <p>(c) <hi rend="italic">Jerusalem</hi>: … first we would try get through <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution providing for functional internationalization of Holy Places along lines of Swedish 1950 draft… .</p>
                        <p>(d) <hi rend="italic">Blockade</hi>: An essential part of any settlement is that Egypt should open Suez Canal to Israel ships and Israel-bound traffic and <pb xml:id="pg_290" n="290" facs="0318"/>that Arab States [should cease to?] put pressure on third parties not to trade with Israel. We would not however ask Arabs engage in direct trade with Israel themselves, even after settlement. Wording of draft statement designed make this distinction.</p>
                        <p>We propose give parties about 24 hours notice that statements are to be made. Substance of statements would not be revealed at that stage but we would say we hoped both sides would receive them in constructive spirit with willingness look seriously for common ground. We would point out that statements do not call for immediate reply or decision on part of govts nor do they carry any suggestion of coercion. We hope indeed that govts will take their time and be prepared discuss our ideas with us further. In meantime we would ask them in their public reactions to exercise restraint and at least not commit themselves against our suggestions until they have had chance discuss with us in greater detail the advantages we believe them to contain.</p>
                        <p>We would also inform certain other govts and authorities, notably France, Turkey, Commonwealth, <gloss target="#t_UNSYG1">UNSYG</gloss>, <persName>Burns</persName> and Labouisse, a few days in advance of statements and seek their support. We will want couch our communications to govts in manner best calculated avoid leak. We would solicit support of other <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members at time of publication of plan.</p>
                        <p>Chiefs of Mission are asked comment on (a) best way of presenting proposals to govts to which accredited; (b) likely response both of govts and people; (c) whether public reaction would be such as necessitate any special preparations or precautions; (d) best lines of publicity; and (e) whether either Chief of Mission or effective head of govt to which accredited will be out of country on or about Aug 18.</p>
                        <p>Need for absolute secrecy stressed and matter to be revealed only to minimum number senior officers in each mission. Before replying Chiefs of Mission are to consult US or <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> colleagues respectively. <hi rend="italic">End summary</hi>.</p>
                        <p>If Dept approves my sending letters as suggested above, subject to decision at Paris meeting, please cable approval for my attention this Emb and also Paris my attention merely stating “Message approved.”</p>
                        <p>If not please cable views to London and send message Paris “not approved.” In latter case I will return London before going on to Washington.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>’s staff has already raised with him the possibility that his trip might be postponed until afterwards. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> felt, however, that to do so would open him—and, through him, the United States—to the accusation of bad faith. In his previous visits, he has emphasized to the Arabs that acceptance of the Jordan Valley proposals would not imply any political accommodation with Israel. Your proposed statement, he believes, will necessarily link a settlement on the water issue with the other elements set forth. The Arabs will assume that your statement was discussed with him and has his approval. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> therefore has personal grounds for not wanting the statement made before he returns to the area and either succeeds or fails.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The following comments are submitted on the Alpha proposals worked out by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Francis Russell</persName> with the British in London (London telegrams 141 and 142,<note n="2" xml:id="d157fn2">
                                <ref target="#d153">Documents 153</ref> and <ref target="#d154">154</ref>.</note> Tab A).</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">British concern at area reaction to public statement</hi>.</p>
                        <p>We agree that a sharply critical initial reaction may occur. However, we believe the British overstate the strength and possible results of the reaction. Although elements on both sides almost automatically attack any reasonable proposals, it is unlikely that either party will take drastic action. The proposals contain important benefits for Jordan. Assessment by our missions of this problem will be especially helpful.</p>
                        <p>We question whether grave disturbances will necessarily occur in the refugee camps, particularly since the leaders are offered the attractive prospect of compensation. The point the refugees probably will resent most strongly is the omission from the statement of any mention of their return to Israel. In the absence of an indication that the U.S. and U.K. intend to impose the proposals, Israel is unlikely to erupt. Instead she may well exert extreme pressure to obtain an <pb xml:id="pg_294" n="294" facs="0322"/>interpretation of the proposals agreeable to her; endeavor to place the onus for any rejection on the Arabs; and in that context renew her drive for a security guarantee. We doubt that Nuri will risk his newly acquired prestige and leadership won through taking the lead in cooperative area defense arrangements by reacting violently over the Israel problem.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">British suggestions for U.S. action to counter adverse Iraq reaction</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Neither proposal appears particularly useful in mitigating a genuinely popular reaction; both are actions the U.K. has sought persistently from the U.S. in other contexts.</p>
                        <p>A summary of the off-shore procurement problem, particularly as it relates to Centurion tanks, is attached (Tab B).<note n="3" xml:id="d157fn3">Not printed.</note> We recommend replying to the British that the U.S. intends to continue the present policies on offshore procurement; that the present Iraq aid program contemplates no tanks; that we do not see how signing a contract for delivery of tanks at a much later date will influence appreciably Iraq public reaction to the statement. This reply is in accord with the President’s decision on Middle East Defense policy<note n="4" xml:id="d157fn4">According to a July 11 memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> to the Secretary, the President that day approved the Department’s position that the United States should continue to procure limited amounts of military equipment for Middle East defense from British sources and should encourage the United Kingdom to provide more resources for the defense of the area.

                        <p>Under existing circumstances, the U.S. does not think it wise to adhere or otherwise formally associate itself with the Pact, particularly because this would adversely affect our influence in bringing about a reduction in Arab-Israel tensions. We do not, however, exclude the possibility that we shall eventually adhere, and we shall keep this question under constant review in the light of developments.<note n="5" xml:id="d157fn5">This statement is from a memorandum entitled “Defense of the Middle East”, which <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> gave the President at their meeting on July 11.

                        </p>
                        <p>We recommend informing Nuri of the substance of the above decision if Embassy Baghdad and the British believe it would be helpful in connection with the Alpha statement. In any event, Nuri will have been informed before the statement is issued that the U.S. will establish close liaison arrangements with the pact organization, which should allay any suspicions on his part that U.S. support for the Turk-Iraq pact is weakening.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_295" n="295" facs="0323"/>
                        <p>3. We should ask the British for a copy of their proposed statement. Since we have considered their views on ours they should be willing to receive our comments.</p>
                        <p>4. We concur that the views of the U.S. and U.K. Chiefs of Mission at Cairo, Tel Aviv, Amman, Damascus, Beirut and Baghdad should be sought. In addition, we should not single out Jidda for omission.</p>
                        <p>5. The proposed memorandum is excellent and should be sent to the field. The date of your proposed statement should be changed to read “about August 25”, in accordance with your commitment to <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Eric Johnston</persName>.</p>
                        <p>6. We agree that a short advance notice to the parties is desirable and that other governments and authorities should be informed also. The approach each mission will use to the foreign government should be carefully worked out to assure the best possible reception. Your talks with <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> should prove most helpful in this regard. Leaks will probably occur, but last-minute disclosures need not be harmful. They may serve a useful purpose in focusing public attention, increasing the impact, and also may lessen the chances of a spontaneous unthinking adverse reaction such as might occur if the statement came without warning.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said that he had discussed with the British Cabinet this morning the new proposal that the Alpha Plan should be launched by means of a public statement rather than through the procedure of secret approaches to the parties.<note n="2" xml:id="d158fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_AWW1">Aldrich</persName> reported on July 13 in telegram 148 from London that he had presented the proposal to <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> the previous afternoon and that the latter was presenting it to the Cabinet that day. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> Central Files, 684A.86/7–1355)</note> He said that he had not had long notice of this change of plan and that the Cabinet had felt unable to take a final decision so quickly. They were concerned <pb xml:id="pg_296" n="296" facs="0324"/>by the risks which the procedure would involve, risks which would fall to a large extent on Great Britain by reason of her commitments in the area. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> himself would prefer that if the procedure of public statements were adopted, it should be a wholly joint announcement, rather than an announcement in which the United States declared a policy and Her Majesty’s Government said that they had been consulted and were in agreement. He said that the Israeli would in his view no doubt in the end accept the situation revealed by such statements, particularly since they were heavily dependent upon the United States. The greater difficulty was with the Arab world.</p>
                        <p>He therefore felt justified in asking Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> to consider certain ways in which the United States could help to mitigate hostile reactions by the Arabs, and particularly dangerous effects on the position of Nuri, the Turco-Iraqi Pact, and the British-Iraqi Agreement. He had the following suggestions to make: (1) Would the United States consider giving its support to the Turco-Iraqi Pact now? (2) Would the United States be prepared to assure Nuri that he would receive arms by offshore purchase? He referred particularly to the case of tanks. (3) Should not our two Governments concert together what precautionary measures might be required in the event of outbreaks of one kind or another in the area?</p>
                        <p>In this connection Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> pointed out that the United States had originally been very favorable to the elaboration of the Northern Tier concept, that in the event Her Majesty’s Government had adhered to it and the United States had not, the Arab world as a whole was watching to see whether Iraq obtained the reward she expected for her courage in her taking this step, thereby splitting the Arab world.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> told Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> that he had recently heard through Mr. Lester Pearson that the Egyptian Foreign Minister speaking privately had adumbrated a solution of the Palestine problem which did not differ greatly from the Alpha proposals. Although he did not necessarily represent entirely the views of the revolutionary command in Egypt, this was at least an encouraging feature.</p>
                        <p>A telegram from Sir Michael Wright, British Ambassador in Baghdad, on the possible effects of such statements in Iraq was read.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> explained the political reasons which impelled him to make some statement on the subject of Israel in the near future. He did not say that it had to be this month or next month, but it must [be] some time in the early fall. He too had spoken to <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> who had agreed that if a settlement was to be reached, it must be through some initiative by the Western powers and must be during the current year. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName>, the United States Ambassador in <pb xml:id="pg_297" n="297" facs="0325"/>Cairo, had, however, warned him that it would be rash to pay too much attention to what <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> said in this matter.</p>
                        <p>As regards the procedure of private negotiation which of course he would have preferred, Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> pointed out that this would not be sufficient in the coming months unless it might suggest rapid strides as to enable some public results to be shown in the next few months which he did not believe was likely. He said that he had himself been thinking of a statement rather less detailed than that which had now been produced by the Working Group.<note n="3" xml:id="d158fn3">A copy of the Working Group’s draft statement for Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ consideration is <hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi>

Secretary’s Statement: Letr of 7/22 to <gloss target="#t_NE1">NE</gloss> Chiefs of Mission, with 4 attachments re.</note> He would like to see the statement contain principles only. For example, he had suggested eliminating the references to Arab villages, their lands, the Latrun salient, and to the over and under passes in the Negev. He thought we would be more likely to avoid outbursts and attract inquiries into our proposals and that if we succeeded in doing that the Governments would have “gotten their feet wet”, and we should at least have made a beginning. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said that he agreed generally with this thought. He felt that it was not over details of this kind that the Arab outbursts would be likely to arise, but rather over a general proposition that they should make peace with Israel. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that he was thoroughly prepared to take the position that Israel should not get a security guarantee until a settlement had been worked out. He anticipated that there would be some pressure against this, but he felt that it would be possible to stand up to it.</p>
                        <p>As regards Iraq, Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that the United States Government could indicate to her that it was impossible for the United States to join the Northern Tier Pact or indeed to make any pact with Arab states until this question was settled, but that if this could be achieved, the United States would be prepared to join the Pact. In the meantime the United States would maintain contact with the defense discussions of the Northern Tier through observers and would give its strong support to the Northern Tier. As regards timing Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that he [had] undertaken through Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Eric Johnston</persName> that he would not make the statement until after Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>’s forthcoming visit to the area in connection with the Jordan waters. Taking into account the holiday period around the end of August, this meant that the statement could probably not take place until about the first week of September.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that Mr. Schuckburgh and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> would review the various papers that had been drafted during the previous week on the launching of Alpha in the light of these discussions and <pb xml:id="pg_298" n="298" facs="0326"/>present specific proposals to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> and Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> the following day.<note n="4" xml:id="d158fn4">

                        <p>In accordance with instructions given to us last evening by Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>, we suggest the following course of procedure on Alpha:</p>
                        <p>1. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>’ statement will be postponed to early September.<note n="2" xml:id="d159fn2">Originally this sentence read: “Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>’ statement will be postponed to Thursday, September 8.” Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> made the textual changes.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Attached is a revised draft of Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>’ statement omitting mention of specific details of the proposed settlement.<note n="3" xml:id="d159fn3">See <ref target="#d169">Document 169</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> would make a supporting statement (subject to 4 below) twenty-four hours later. Attached is a suggested draft of such a statement.<note n="4" xml:id="d159fn4">See <ref target="#d169">Document 169</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. It will be necessary to await further discussion by the British Cabinet before deciding whether the statements would indicate that <gloss target="#t_HM1">HM</gloss> Government had participated fully and from the beginning in the proposals outlined; or whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> would merely welcome the <persName>Dulles</persName> statement and support it.</p>
                        <p>5. If possible, Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> will inform Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> prior to this Cabinet discussion (probably around July 26) concerning (a) what the U.S. would be prepared to say to the Iraq Government following the enunciation of the Alpha proposals with respect to eventual U.S. adherence to the Turko-Iraq Pact, and (b) whether it would be <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> policy that Iraq be supplied Centurion tanks under <gloss target="#t_OSP1">OSP</gloss>, assuming appropriate timing and political conditions; and whether Nuri might be informed of this and told that delivery of the tanks will depend upon the manner in which the Alpha proposals are received by the Iraq Government.</p>
                        <p>6. The U.S. and U.K. Missions in Israel and the Arab countries should be informed, on a secret basis, of the proposals for the Alpha <pb xml:id="pg_299" n="299" facs="0327"/>statements as soon as <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> has formulated its position under paragraph 4 above.</p>

                        <p>11. I saw General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> this morning and found him now cautiously optimistic regarding Gaza talks. He is reporting to <gloss target="#t_UNSYG1">UNSYG</gloss> along following lines relative past 3 days meetings:</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Begin Paraphrase</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Although there is still considerable suspicion atmosphere now improved. It should be possible achieve certain results in course next few weeks, barring occurrence some extraneous incident. With regard to “arrangement for maintaining security along the D/<gloss target="#t_L1">L</gloss>” all clauses now agreed except important ones relating to position officers representing parties and means communication between them. Appears possible obtain consent both parties to telephone line to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> observer stationed at kilo 95, who would relay messages or arrange for commanders to converse. Regarding question level local commanders for purposes agreement, Israel wants commander specified while Egypt willing agree only specify “senior officer with authority to ensure required action.” However, Egypt gave unofficial assurance that this officer will have status of staff officer to local commander with power issue orders (in absence his superior) on subjects within scope arrangement.</p>
                        <p>There was considerable “shadow-boxing” with reference question joint patrols and border obstacle. Gohar wished discuss patrols first, in hope that Israel would refuse unqualified agreement. He would then be in good position raise objection proposals regarding obstacle. <persName>Burns</persName> will try to advance modified proposal combining the two concepts, and believes Egypt will stand by undertaking made in Security Council to erect obstacle along portions D/L. Owing questions internal politics and Arab States relations, Egypt finds it difficult agree effective continuous barrier.</p>

                            <persName>Burns</persName> said clauses of commanders arrangement upon which agreement reached are:</p>
                        <p>(1) Obligation regarding recovery and return stolen property,</p>
                        <p>(2) Settlement minor incidents within framework of arrangement,</p>
                        <p>(3) Exchange of information regarding persons crossing D/<gloss target="#t_L1">L</gloss>,</p>
                        <p>(4) Enforcement strict measures re prevention such crossings,</p>
                        <p>(5) Periodic meetings of local commanders, and</p>
                        <p>(6) Return of infiltrators at meetings of commanders.</p>
                        <p>Gohar unwilling make commitment about punishment of returned infiltrators, and likewise would not agree to proposal providing for exchange of information concerning or giving publicity to such punishments.</p>
                        <p>Both parties agreed refrain from controversial publicity pending next meetings which scheduled for July 20. In <persName>Burns</persName> opinion there is fair possibility to conclude local commanders arrangement next week. He said Gohar somewhat more cooperative is still very slow and cautious. Tekoah seemed very reasonable to deal with and possibly subject some criticism from Israelis for not being “hard-boiled” enough.<note n="2" xml:id="d160fn2">On July 18, Secretary-General <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName> in Geneva gave Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> the text of General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName>’ report.

                        <pb xml:id="pg_301" n="301" facs="0329"/>
                        <p>“The proposal to make a public statement on the Alpha plan for Palestine carries serious risks which will fall largely upon Her Majesty’s Government by reason of our responsibilities and commitments in the Arab world. The main danger is that there might be a violent reaction in Iraq against the Baghdad Pact and the new Anglo-Iraqi agreement which might lead to the weakening or even the fall of Nuri. In that event the whole concept of a Middle East defense organization would be swept away.</p>
                        <p>“2. There are two ways in which the United States could help to mitigate these risks. The first is by making it clear to the Iraqi Government that if a Palestine settlement could be achieved on the lines suggested in the proposed statement the United States would be prepared to join the Iraqi-Turkish Pact. On this point the United States Secretary of State has given assurances to the Foreign Secretary.</p>
                        <p>“3. The second, and even more important, point is that an early decision should be taken that the Iraqi Army shall be equipped with British Centurion tanks. Nuri has indicated that he wishes this, but that he desires the tanks to be supplied free under the American military aid programme, that is to say, by off-shore purchase. The strategic arguments for basing Iraq’s armoured formations on British equipment have been fully set out to the United States Government. Primarily it is a question of the Iraqi forces being able to operate in conjunction with British armoured units in the Middle East and to share repair and supply facilities. Not until this matter is resolved can the Iraqi Government show that they are receiving from the West the reward to which they are entitled for their courage in joining the northern tier.</p>
                        <p>“4. It would therefore greatly allay the anxieties which Her Majesty’s Government must feel regarding the proposed Alpha action if the United States Government could agree as follows:—(a) that it will be U.S. Government policy to supply the Iraqi armoured forces with Centurion tanks by off-shore purchase; and (b) that Nuri may be informed of this decision now and the launching of the Alpha statements.”</p>

                        <p>On the evening of July 17, President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> met with British Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony</persName>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>, who gave him the message, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>. The President described this meeting in a diary entry of July 19, the relevant portion of which reads as follows:</p>
                        <p>“<hi rend="italic">Mid-East</hi>. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony</persName> also was concerned about the Mid East. He has been talking to <persName corresp="#p_FAB1">Foster</persName> about the so-called ‘Alpha Plan.’</p>

                        <p> “He feels that if any public statement is made by the United States that is interpreted in the region as slanted in favor of Israel, that we are going to lose a lot of Arab support. This support is already shaky and it could, in his opinion, switch toward the Soviet very markedly. The Arabs themselves, of course, are weak except that (together with Iran) they possess the world’s greatest oil reserves.</p>
                        <p>“He believes that if we could do something to meet Iraq’s military ambitions <hi rend="italic">before</hi> we make any announcement slanted toward Israel, that the effect of such announcement would be largely nullified.</p>
                        <p>“Britain had wanted to sell Centurion tanks to Iraq. But that country has been insisting that it was going to get them for nothing from the United States.</p>
                        <p>“In these circumstances the British were hopeful that we would buy Centurion tanks as part of our offshore procurement program and give the necessary number to Iraq.</p>
                        <p>“I told him I did not see much sense to us assuming full financial responsibility for such a proposition, but I did tell him that if Britain would provide a satisfactory portion of the costs, we might participate because we were <hi rend="italic">of course</hi> interested in strengthening the ‘northern tier’ of Arab States, of which Iraq is a part.</p>
                        <p>“Actually I think we should look up the financial status of Iraq. It is entirely possible that that country could afford to pay at least a minor portion of the cost, Britain could then assume a bigger portion and we could foot the rest of the bill. In this way we would really be implementing the thought behind the <hi rend="italic">Mutual</hi> Security Program.” (Eisenhower Library, Whitman File, <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Diaries)</p>

                        <p>“The President said he had told <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> it was impossible for us to put up the money to enable them to manufacture and give away Centurion tanks to the Iraqi. If, however, the British were prepared to carry a substantial part of the burden we might then do some of it. He said that in principle he favored the use in the Middle East of equipment of British design so as to minimize the burden upon us of replacement of spare parts in the event of war.” (Department of State, Central Files, 396.1–GE/7–1855)</p>

                        <p>1. No tanks of any type have been scheduled by US for Iraqis, and suggestion of <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> that <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> should supply Centurions (at US expense) was first intimated to us by <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> in US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> strategy talks two weeks ago. We made no comment.</p>
                        <p>2. Iraqis have not indicated they want us to obtain Brit tanks for them. We understand they prefer US equipment.</p>
                        <p>3. In view broad effect which your talks at Geneva may have upon future joint US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> plans for <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> defense, we are suggesting to <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> that continuation of <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> strategy talks which are scheduled for this week should be postponed until after Geneva conference has been concluded. <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had presented its concepts two weeks ago, which could involve us in substantially stepped-up expenditures.

                        <p>“Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> mentioned that the Egyptians had recently offered to buy from the United States a substantial (for them) quantity of tanks, guns and ammunition; that they had hinted that they would buy from the Russians if we didn’t sell to them. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> thought this latter would be bad, but doubted that the Russians would sell to the Egyptians.</p>
                        <p>“Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said he thought we would make the sale; that it couldn’t be aid because the Egyptians would not make the kind of agreement in connection with aid that our laws require.</p>
                        <p>“<persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> said the British were furnishing some small amount of armaments to the Egyptians; that the French were too; that some of it was being resold through Libya to the Arabs and shot back at the French in Morocco and Algeria.” (Eisenhower Library, Project Clean Up)</p>

It seems to <pb xml:id="pg_305" n="305" facs="0333"/>me that United States security interests that area require us in our own interests to meet <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s request in order prevent <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> from concluding that there is virtually no prospect of fruitful cooperation with the United States in any of the most important foreign issues currently confronting Egypt. If convinced United States indifferent to Egypt’s military position and that we in fact may have objective keeping Egypt in relatively weak position vis-à-vis Israel, <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> in all probability will then wish carefully reexplore possibilities of cooperation with Soviet bloc, including the question of arms procurement. Effect of Egypt’s decision would not be confined Egypt alone. While of course cannot be certain course this reexamination will take and relaxing tension along border might stay Egypt’s hand, all evidence we have points to fact that Egypt will most probably accept Russian offer of arms. These purchases may be substantial as payment acceptable in cotton which Egypt otherwise unable dispose of.</p>
                        <p>We may not like to be faced with this type of situation as factor in making up our mind whether Egypt should be able buy arms from United States but fact is we are so faced. Certainly it seems to me we should be prepared avoid such consequences as long as we can conscientiously say arms we provide are not upsetting balance and fall within the defensive requirements envisaged by tripartite declaration. Am not recommending going beyond this point as this would in fact be getting into arms race in area which tripartite declaration of course opposes. The point is, however, once Russian arms begin to enter this area on side of Arabs the West will have lost control and the arms race will be on as we certainly would not be in a position under those circumstances to deny Israeli requests for more arms irrespective of the consequences to our relations with the Arab States. Consequence <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> reliance on Russian arms would not be limited to arms race but very possibly would open Egypt Soviet penetration all spheres with considerable influence other Arab States.</p>
                        <p>I hope Department can send me as soon as possible cost and availability data re items on <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s list. When final Egyptian decision has been made as to items required (and in this decision <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss>’s limited foreign currency holdings will probably play important part), Department will then be in better position review Israeli requests on basis of relative military capabilities.</p>
                        <p>Department of course must weigh all aspects prior to decision, but for my part I cannot entirely forget that it was Israeli action that initially started build up of tension at Gaza that has resulted in <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> decision purchase more armament. Nor can I ignore in my thinking fact that even if <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> decided purchase entire list Egypt’s position would still remain relatively weak as compared to Israel. Under these conditions it would seem to me that a decision which would not <pb xml:id="pg_306" n="306" facs="0334"/>permit Egypt to purchase arms in the United States (or specify that Israeli purchases should be equal purchases by Egypt) would hardly be consistent with policy of impartiality we have tried so hard to establish and maintain over past three years.</p>

                        <p>DEAR MR. SECRETARY: The Egyptian Government officially requested on June 30 permission to purchase in the United States the items of military equipment on the attached list.<note n="2" xml:id="d167fn2">Not printed.</note> It is our belief, concurred in by our Ambassador in Cairo, that a substantial portion of these items are needed to enable Egypt to meet legitimate national defense requirements.</p>
                        <p>The matter was discussed with the President on July 11 at a meeting attended by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName> and myself.<note n="3" xml:id="d167fn3">See <ref target="#d144fn4">footnote 4, Document 144</ref>.</note> The President attached importance to improving our relations with Egyptian Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Gamal Abdel Nasser</persName> and indicated that he saw no objection to meeting the Egyptian request in whole or in part unless such action would cause undue complications with Israel.</p>
                        <p>We believe, on political grounds, that it is desirable for the United States to offer to provide at least some portion of the equipment requested. Objections from Israel must be anticipated, but <pb xml:id="pg_308" n="308" facs="0336"/>we think the sale will not have undue effects upon our relations with that country since Israel is entitled to purchase in the United States on the same basis as Egypt. As a practical matter, actual deliveries of many of the items could be spread over a period of time so that no sudden increase of Egyptian military capabilities would be effected. Also, we understand the latest estimate by <gloss target="#t_Gndash21">G–2</gloss> indicates that Israel has a decisive military superiority over the Arab states combined. The United States should be prepared, however, to meet in part certain of Israel’s outstanding requests to purchase equipment in this country.</p>
                        <p>Our Ambassador in Cairo reports that in the absence of a favorable response, Egypt may accept the arms offer recently made by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The Ambassador’s assessment is supported by intelligence reports. Should an Egyptian-Soviet arms sale materialize, it would have adverse repercussions on our position in the Middle East. Another important reason for the sale is to arrest the conviction growing in Egypt that the United States alone is endeavoring to prevent her from purchasing arms.</p>
                        <p>The equipment would be made available under the reimbursable aid agreement between the United States and Egypt signed on December 10, 1952 and in accordance with the terms of Section 106 of the Mutual Security Act of 1954. We believe it important to inform the Egyptians promptly that we are prepared to consider supplying a portion of the equipment requested, and we would appreciate having your concurrence in a Governmental position of this nature. Members of my staff already have requested from your Department price and availability data on the equipment involved and we would appreciate any steps you may take to expedite the study.</p>
                        <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

AMBASSADOR: At the Secretary’s direction, I have been conferring with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Evelyn Shuckburgh</persName> and other members of the British Foreign Office concerning possible statements in the near future by the Secretary and the British Foreign Secretary on a settlement of the Israel-Arab controversy. The reasons for the statements and the form which they might take are set forth in the enclosures to this letter.<note n="2" xml:id="d169fn2">Enclosures 1 and 2 are printed below. Enclosure 3, not printed, dated July 15, was headed “Draft British Statement (to follow statement by Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>)”.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>I should like very much to have your comments on the following points:</p>
                        <p>(1) The best way of presenting the proposals outlined in the memorandum to the Government to which you are accredited. Is the approach suggested in paragraph 5 of the enclosed memorandum the best, and where and when should it be made?</p>
                        <p>(2) The probable response both of the Government and local public opinion to the proposed statements.</p>
                        <p>(3) Whether you believe that immediate public reaction would be likely to be such as to indicate the need for any special preparations or precautions on our part.</p>
                        <p>(4) The best lines of publicity both before and after the statements are made.</p>
                        <p>(5) Whether you, or the effective head of the Government to which you are accredited, will be out of the country in early September.</p>
                        <p>Please send your comments as soon as possible by Top Secret telegram to the Department, Limited Distribution, with code name Alpha, repeating to London only.</p>
                        <p>It is of primary importance to insure absolute secrecy in this matter. Please limit sight of this letter and its enclosures to the minimum number of senior members of your staff whom you feel <pb xml:id="pg_311" n="311" facs="0339"/>you must consult; and, for the present, keep this letter and all correspondence connected with it in your private safe.</p>
                        <p>Before replying, however, please consult your British colleague to whom the Foreign Office is sending a similar communication. I am sending similar letters and enclosures to our Chiefs of Mission in Cairo, Amman, Damascus, Beirut and Baghdad; and for their information only, to our Ambassadors in Paris and Ankara.</p>

                        <p rend="center">PALESTINE SETTLEMENT<note n="4" xml:id="d169fn4">Top Secret; Alpha.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Foreign Office and the Department of State have reached agreement on the need for an equitable settlement of the Palestine affair and the best means of attempting to achieve it.</p>
                        <p>2. The intention had been that the first approach would be made to the Prime Minister of Egypt. But this has not proved possible, largely because of Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s preoccupation with the immediate tension on the Gaza strip, and we do not think it likely that we should be able to enlist his interest in moving towards a settlement for some time to come. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> is convinced that he cannot refrain much longer from defining the policy of the United States towards Israel’s security and the Middle East as a whole. The longer he waits, the more difficult it will become for him to make a balanced statement on the subject: as the United States Presidential elections approach, the pressure for a statement favorable to Israel will increase. He feels that he must crystallize United States policy on the issue; and that he should therefore soon make a statement, to which the United States Administration could hold firmly, on the general lines of the proposals for a Palestine settlement <pb xml:id="pg_312" n="312" facs="0340"/>which our two Governments have worked out. It is our hope that the two parties to the dispute, even though they may vigorously reject the proposed settlement at first, will, in the long run, come to see its merits and move slowly towards it. On the other hand we are not blind to the grave risks which the action entails.</p>
                        <p>3. Attached to this memorandum is a copy of a draft of a speech which Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> proposes to deliver early in September and which contains an outline of the settlement which H.M. Government and the U.S. Government believe to be the fairest now possible. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> is seeking the authority of his Cabinet colleagues to make a statement the next day expressing H.M. Government’s support for the principles enunciated by Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> and their readiness to help in bringing about a settlement and to make a contribution to the financial commitments which a settlement would involve.</p>
                        <p>4. In general, we shall avoid being drawn into publishing any fuller details of the proposed settlement, on the grounds that to do so would prejudice any negotiations which the parties might wish to enter into, whether between themselves or through third parties, on the basis of the principles which we shall have enunciated. The recipients of this memorandum will be sent guidance for publicity and help in dealing with enquiries later. Meanwhile, the following are explanations of some of the specific proposals contained in the enclosed draft statement:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Guarantees</p>
                        <p>As will be seen from the draft statement, it is intended that these should be limited to the territorial aspect of the settlement. It will be made clear, however, that they would not be granted except in the framework of a comprehensive settlement. (In other words, acceptance by one party of part or all the plan would not earn the guarantee.)</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Boundaries</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">The Negev</hi>. The idea here is that Israel should cede to Egypt a triangle of territory with its base on the Egyptian frontier and to Jordan another triangle with its base on the Jordan frontier. The apex of one triangle would meet the apex of the other on the Israeli road from the north to Elath. The principle underlying this solution is that there would be a point at the junction of the two triangles where the sovereignty would appertain to both sides. This would make it possible for an East-West Arab road under complete Arab control to pass over (or under) an Israeli North-South road under complete Israeli control. We can see no way of reconciling the vital interests of both parties in the Negev except by this principle. We should not commit ourselves on the size and location of the triangles: that would be left for negotiation. We have, however, got various alternative ideas.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_313" n="313" facs="0341"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. Jerusalem</p>
                        <p>… we should try to get through the United Nations a resolution providing for the “functional internationalization” of the Holy Places, on the lines of the Swedish draft resolution of 1950… .</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">D. The Blockade</p>
                        <p>It would be essential, as part of any settlement, that the Egyptians should open the Suez Canal to Israeli ships and Israel-bound traffic; and that the Arab states should cease to put pressure on third parties not to trade with Israel. We would not, however, ask the Arabs to engage in direct trade with Israel themselves, even after a settlement. The wording of the enclosed draft statement is designed to allow for this distinction to be made.</p>
                        <p>5. We should propose to give the parties to the dispute about 24 hours’ notice that the statements are to be made. We should not reveal the substance of the statements at that stage, but we should say that we hoped that both sides would receive them in a constructive spirit and with a willingness to look seriously for common ground. We should point out that the statements do not call for an immediate reply or decision on the part of the Governments nor do they carry any suggestion of coercion. We hope indeed that the Governments will take their time and will be prepared to discuss our ideas with us further. In the meantime we would ask them in their public reactions to the statements to exercise restraint and at least not to commit themselves against the suggestions until they have had a chance to discuss with us in greater detail the advantages we believe them to contain.</p>
                        <p>6. We should also inform certain other Governments and authorities, notably France, Turkey, the Commonwealth and the Secretary-General of the United Nations (and through him General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> and Mr. Labouisse) a few days in advance of these statements and seek their support for our proposals. We will want to couch our communications to Governments in the manner best calculated to avoid leaks. We should solicit the support of other states members of the United Nations at the time of the publication of the plan.</p>

                        <p rend="center">DRAFT OF POSSIBLE PUBLIC STATEMENT BY MR. <persName>DULLES</persName> ON AN ISRAEL-ARAB SETTLEMENT<note n="5" xml:id="d169fn5">Top Secret; Alpha.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Two years ago last month I returned from a trip which took me to the Near East. I wanted to see, for myself, that area, so rich in culture and tradition, yet today so torn by strife and bitterness. I visited Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia. Upon my return I spoke of the impressions gathered on that trip and of the hopes which I hold as a result of talks with leaders and people there.</p>
                        <p>Some of those hopes have become realities. Two years ago the Suez Base was a center of controversy and of potential strife. In my report to the American people, I expressed the conviction that there was nothing irreconcilable in the positions of the two Governments, and the hope that both sides would continue to try to find a peaceful solution. I said that the United States was prepared to help in any desired way. Since that time, as a result of patient effort, in a spirit of conciliation, the problem of the Suez Base has been successfully resolved.</p>
                        <p>Another problem which was concerning many of the leaders in the Middle East was that of securing the area against the menace of aggression from without the area. It was clear that effective defense depended upon collective measures and that such measures, to be dependable, needed to be based on the development within the area of a sense of common destiny and of common danger. Here, too, there has been encouraging progress and a growing realization of the need for cooperation in defense.</p>
                        <p>A third problem which called for attention was the need for water to irrigate land. I mentioned in my report the possibility that the rivers flowing through the Jordan Valley might be used to make this important and fertile valley a source of livelihood rather than dispute. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Eric Johnston</persName>’s talks since that time with the governments of the countries through which the River Jordan runs have shown an encouraging willingness on both sides to contemplate the principle of coordinated arrangements for the use of the waters and plans for the development of the Valley are well advanced.</p>
                        <p>A beginning has been made, as you see, in dealing with the obstacles that stand in the way of the aspirations of the Near Eastern peoples. It is my hope—and it is that hope of which I would <pb xml:id="pg_315" n="315" facs="0343"/>now speak—that the time has come when it is useful to think in terms of further steps toward stability, tranquillity and progress in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Arab-Israel Problem</p>
                        <p>What are the principal remaining problems? There are three that stand out above the others.</p>
                        <p>The first is the tragic plight of the 900,000 refugees who formerly lived in the territory that is now occupied by Israel.</p>
                        <p>The second is the pall of fear that hangs over the Arab and Israel people alike. The Arab countries fear that Israel will seek by violent means to expand at their expense. The Israelis fear that the Arabs will gradually marshall superior forces to be used to drive them into the sea and resent the measures of economic blockade which are now enforced against them.</p>
                        <p>The third is the lack of fixed permanent boundaries between Israel and its Arab neighbors.</p>
                        <p>There are other important problems. But if these three principal problems could be dealt with, then the way would be paved for the solution of others.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that these three problems are capable of solution, and surely there is need.</p>
                        <p>Border clashes take an almost weekly toll of human lives. The sufferings of the 900,000 Arab refugees are drawn out almost beyond the point of endurance. The fears which are at work, on each side, lead to a heavy burden of armament, which constitutes a serious drag on economic and social progress. Responsible leaders are finding it hard to turn their full attention and energies to the positive task of creating the conditions of stability and healthy growth out of which strong nations could emerge.</p>
                        <p>Serious as the present situation is, there is a danger that unless it improves, it will get worse. <gloss target="#t_ONE1">One</gloss> ill leads to another, and cause and effect are hard to sort out. Both sides suffer greatly from the present situation, and both are anxious for what they would regard as a just and equitable solution. But neither has been able to find that way. This may be a situation where mutual friends could, through their good offices, serve the common good.</p>
                        <p>The United States, as a friend of both Israelis and Arabs, has given the situation deep thought and has come to certain conclusions, the expansion of which may help men of good will within the area to fresh constructive efforts. I speak in this matter with the authority of the President.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_316" n="316" facs="0344"/>
                        <p rend="center">I.</p>
                        <p>We find no single and easy answer to the plight of the 900,000 Arab refugees who formerly lived in the territory that is now Israel, who fled at the time of the fighting in 1948 and were barred from returning to their homes and the cost of whose maintenance now falls directly on the international community. But we do feel that an answer can be found in a combination of measures which, together, would reestablish these uprooted people and offer them hope of a new life.</p>
                        <p>Compensation by the State of Israel is due for the land and buildings belonging to the refugees which are now in Israel’s possession. Perhaps Israel cannot, unaided, now make adequate compensation. If so, there might be an international loan to Israel of the balance of the sum necessary. The President would recommend substantial participation by the United States in such a loan for such a purpose.</p>
                        <p>Money alone, however, will not solve the problem. The money must be used to create more arable land on which the refugees could make permanent homes and work to produce a self-respecting livelihood. Many of them would be settled over a period of the next few years as a result of projects much as the Jordan Valley development plan, the Sinai project, and as a result of the increased opportunities provided by the expanding economies of countries of the area. Here, too, outside help might be required.</p>
                        <p rend="center">II.</p>
                        <p>The second principal element which I mentioned is that of fear. The nature of this fear is such that it is not within the capacity of any single country of the area to take measures to dispel it. President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> has authorized me to say that if a solution can be found to the other related problems, he would recommend that the United States formally commit itself to take appropriate action to prevent or thwart any effort by either side to alter by force the boundaries between Israel and its Arab neighbors. I hope that other countries would be willing to join in such a commitment, and it might perhaps be sponsored by the United Nations.</p>
                        <p rend="center">III.</p>
                        <p>If there is to be a guarantee of borders, it would be normal that there should be a prior agreement upon what the borders are. That is the third major element. The existing lines separating the Arab states from Israel were fixed by the Armistice Agreements of 1949. They reflected the status of the fighting at the moment. They were <pb xml:id="pg_317" n="317" facs="0345"/>not designed to be permanent frontiers in every respect. They clearly require rectifications and adjustments.</p>
                        <p>For example, there should presumably be an allocation of the present demilitarized zones and “no man’s lands” created by the Armistice agreements.</p>
                        <p>The Arab world, which is now separated by Israel possession of the Negev, understandably desires an unbroken land connection. This could be provided, without prejudice to any of Israel’s vital interests, by ceding to one or two Arab nations sovereignty over triangular portions of the Negev having little or no economic value and now wholly barren. The Arab triangles could be based on the Egyptian and Jordanian frontiers respectively so that their apexes meet at a point on an Israeli route to the south. Thus the now divided Arabs would reestablish sovereign contact, while the sovereign connection of Israel with the port of Elath would be maintained.</p>
                        <p rend="center">IV.</p>
                        <p>If agreement can be reached on these basic elements—refugees, boundaries, and the elimination of fear—it should prove possible to find solutions for other questions, largely economic, and to bring to an end external economic measures which presently fan the flames of hostility and resentment.</p>
                        <p>It should also be possible to reach agreement on the status of Jerusalem. The United States would give its support to a United Nations review of this problem.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusion</p>
                        <p>I have not attempted to enumerate all the issues on which it would be desirable to have a settlement; nor have I tried to outline in detail the form which a settlement of any of the elements might take. I have tried to show that possibilities exist for an immeasurable improvement without any nation taking action which would be against its interests whether those interests be measured in terms of material strength or, what is more important, in terms of national prestige and honor.</p>
                        <p>Both sides in this strife have a noble past, a heritage of rich contributions to civilization; both have fostered progress in science and the arts. Each side is predominantly representative of one of the world’s great religions. Both sides desire to achieve a good life for their people and to share, and contribute to, the advancements of this century. Both can contribute much to progress in the coming decades. The people of the United States for their part could and would contribute much more readily and more happily if there could <pb xml:id="pg_318" n="318" facs="0346"/>be ended the strains which now burden life within the area, a life which, for most of the people, desperately needs enrichment.</p>
                        <p>At a time when a great effort is being made to ease the tension which has long prevailed between the East and the West, can we not hope that a similar spirit should prevail in the Near East? Indeed, may not the nations there set an example which would show how the spirit of conciliation and of the good neighbor brings rich rewards to the people and to the nations? That is our plea, and if the response involves some burdens, they are burdens which the United States would share, just as we would share the satisfaction which would result to all peoples if happiness, contentment and good will could drive hatred and misery away from peoples whom we hold in high respect and honor.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_CWEJ1">Cole</persName> reported on July 21 that General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> had informed him that the “Gaza talks July 20 proved inconclusive as most of the time was spent endeavoring to overcome Gohar’s quibbling about matters of phraseology. <persName>Burns</persName> added that discussion was almost entirely concerned with unsuccessful efforts to draft various clauses of proposed local commanders arrangements in a manner acceptable to Gohar.” As a result. <persName>Burns</persName> did not believe he could make any progress if such meetings continued; he was contemplating sending <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> an “ultimatum” in an effort to get the talks moving again.

                        <p>Reference is made to the attached copy of a communication on the above subject from the British Prime Minister to the President, dated July 23, 1955.<note n="2" xml:id="d171fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> informed <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> in this communication that the United Kingdom was prepared to expend £500,000 on the purchase of 10 Centurion tanks for Iraq. As Iraq required 80 Centurions, the British gift of 10 would, according to <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>, complement the remaining 70 which the United States would furnish under the offshore procurement program. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> stated that he intended to issue instructions on this as soon as the United States had reached a favorable decision. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> Presidential Correspondence: Lot 66 D 204, <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Correspondence, 1955–1956, Vol. I, as well as in the Eisenhower Library, Whitman File, International File)</note> The President received the communication at Geneva on the same date, handed it to me, and directed that I bring it to your attention promptly upon my return to the United States; also, that I pass on to each of you promptly the substance of the conversations on this subject at Geneva.</p>
                        <p>According to my notes and recollection, the following exchanges of views in Geneva constitute material background:</p>
                        <p>1. On Sunday afternoon, July 17, Sir <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony Eden</persName> called on the President at his villa in Geneva, and brought up with the President the matter of U.S. adherence to the Iraqi-Turkish Pact. The President advised him that he understood no such action was deemed practicable until the Arab-Israeli problem could be clarified. Sir <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony</persName> then brought up the subject of U.S. aid to Iraq, and made particular reference to Centurion Tanks. He proposed to the President that between 50 and 100 tanks be purchased by the U.S. from British Manufacturers under the offshore procurement program, and that such tanks be made available to Iraq. The President asked Sir <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony</persName> what the English proposed to do by way of aid to Iraq, and indicated that he felt the Iraqis should bear at least a token part of the cost. (The foregoing is based upon the President’s statement to me shortly after the conference, as to the substance of the conversations on this subject.)</p>
                        <p>At the President’s direction, I called Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> Tuesday evening (July 19), in Paris,<note n="3" xml:id="d171fn3">No account of this telephone conversation has been found.</note> and asked him to discuss with <pb xml:id="pg_321" n="321" facs="0349"/>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> the matter of the availability of funds for further Iraq aid this year, and be prepared to advise the President on the subject when he reached Geneva the next day.</p>
                        <p>2. On Wednesday, July 20, 1955, Sir <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony</persName>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> and Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Harold Macmillan</persName> had breakfast with the President at his villa, and I joined them at the President’s request, in order that I might record the substance of the conversation.<note n="4" xml:id="d171fn4">See <ref target="#d164">Document 164</ref>.</note> Both <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> suggested that before the “Alpha Plan” was announced, the U.S. should furnish some concrete evidence of an intention to provide further assistance in the form of defense aid to the Iraqis; that such a step would strengthen the present Government; that it would be a major tragedy in the area if the present Government should fall; and that there were many powerful elements within Iraq working for its down-fall. Sir <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony</persName> stated that the British would be prepared to participate in such assistance. The President pointed out that while it was of course desirable to have munitions manufacturing facilities spread about somewhat in the free world, there was a definite limit on funds available for mutual aid. He went ahead to explain his concept of mutuality of aid, which includes participation by countries mutually interested in common defense, and suggested again that Iraq should bear some of the cost. He said that his experience had been that when people put some of their own money into a venture, they become more interested in it. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> agreed that there should be some Iraq participation, but the amount of U.S. aid and the degree of British participation were left open.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he would try to get from Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> and Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> some further information as to what we were in a position to do generally in the Middle East, and particularly in Iraq, in the light of available funds under Congressional appropriations for the current year. He stressed the fact that no commitment could be made until we could ascertain how near we were to the limit of Congressional appropriations in this connection.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> then described one of the problems we had to consider back home,—namely, that our military people preferred in dealing with such countries as Iraq to pass on to them older equipment, which in turn gave our Defense Department <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> credit, which could be used to replace old equipment with new equipment. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> urged that the Northern Tier concept of countries bordering Russia on the south, but not actually bordering Israel, had been a U.S. proposal; that the U.S. therefore had a special responsibility to support the countries adhering to treaties within the framework of this concept. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>, while recognizing that the British were <pb xml:id="pg_322" n="322" facs="0350"/>committed to support the arrangement, stressed the U.S. interests and obligations in this particular, and mentioned the fact that at the present time, all tanks in the hands of the Iraqis were of British manufacture.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said that the announcement of the Alpha plan could cause a “blow-up” in the Middle East; that neither the Arabs nor the Israelis would like it at first,—the former because of the recognition of boundaries enlarged by “Israeli aggression”; the latter because it would seem to be “pro-Arab”. Sir <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony</persName> appeared to accept this possibility with equanimity, and regarded it as an immediate but not lasting result of the treaty settlement. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said he felt any “blow-up” from the “Alpha” would be in the nature of a “little fire”, of a kind we sometimes have to set to prevent a “big fire”,—the analogy of forestry fire-fighting.</p>
                        <p>… Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said he had held up any further steps on Alpha at the earnest insistence of <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Eric Johnston</persName>, who believed he could get agreement on the Jordan water projects. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said he felt sure <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> would not succeed, but he had acquiesced in <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>’s request. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> concurred in this appraisal, and incidentally compared the Israelis and Arabs to the Hatfields and the McCoys in Tennessee.</p>
                        <p>It appeared to me to be agreed that the matter of Iraq aid was an urgent one, and must be dealt with promptly, although I did not take it that any specific commitment was made by the President or Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>. The effect of it seemed to be an agreement in principle that the British and the U.S. should both participate in ways and to the extent to be determined later, after Messrs. <persName>Anderson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> arrived in Geneva.</p>
                        <p>On Wednesday evening, July 20, after the discussions at the President’s villa about the disarmament proposal, the President described briefly to Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> the nature of the problem raised by the British that morning at breakfast. It was agreed, as I understood it, that they would discuss it further the next day.<note n="5" xml:id="d171fn5">No account of this conversation has been found in Department of State files.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>I understand that the next day the President and Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> had some further discussions about it.<note n="5" target="d171fn5">No account of this conversation has been found in Department of State files.</note> Whether there were any further talks by the President or Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> and the British thereafter in Geneva, I do not know, but it was my impression that the President did not engage in any further talks.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_323" n="323" facs="0351"/>
                        <p>The President indicated to me that he wanted very prompt action in this matter. As you know, I shall be glad to work with you in any way when I can be of help.</p>

                        <p>A meeting presided over by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> and including representatives of Defense and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> considered on July 27 the British request that we provide Iraq with Centurion tanks by off-shore procurement in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. The meeting concluded that for the reasons given below we should not accede to the British request.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Political</p>
                        <p>1. Adverse effect on the Arab-Israel problem of supplying tanks to Iraq. It was recalled that assurances had been given to Israel’s supporters, to Israel, and to Congressional leaders that no heavy equipment was being programmed for Iraq at this time.</p>
                        <p>2. Establishment of a precedent which was likely to provoke similar requests from other countries. In particular, Saudi Arabia would have additional grounds for pressing a demand for Centurions or their equivalent.</p>
                        <p>3. The adverse effect upon other Arab states of off-shore procuring Centurions for Iraq only. Egypt especially might be encouraged to turn to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for tanks.</p>
                        <p>4. Iraq’s concern that US support for the Turk-Iraq Pact has diminished could be offset adequately by informing Nuri of our intention to establish close liaison with the Pact organization and to adhere when an Israel-Arab accommodation was reached. The Secretary <pb xml:id="pg_324" n="324" facs="0352"/>gave Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> in Geneva assurances that we would so inform Nuri.</p>
                        <p>5. Contrary to the implications of <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s memorandum to the President,<note n="3" xml:id="d172fn3">See <ref target="#d161">Document 161</ref>.</note> Iraq signed the Turk-Iraq Pact in its own self-interest. Among the important benefits accruing to Iraq may be mentioned: an increase in her security against Communism, revision of her treaty with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, and the prestige accruing from her seizure of area leadership in defense matters.</p>
                        <p>6. Iraq has indicated to us a preference for US equipment, and has complained that the Centurions previously furnished by the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> were obsolete.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Military</p>
                        <p>1. Our current appreciation concludes that in the event of a major war, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would not be in a position to supply equipment or spare parts to the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>2. The Turkish, Iranian and Pakistan forces are being supplied with US equipment. Since, in the event of hostilities, Iraqi troops would be grouped with forces from these contiguous countries as well as forces from Britain and Jordan, the logistical problems would not be simplified appreciably by providing Iraq with British equipment.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. Political Military Factors</p>
                        <p>1. In the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 50–54 Mutual Defense Assistance Program, the US has programmed arms and equipment for Iraq to the extent of $10.9 million. There were no additional funds proposed for Iraq in 1955. Out of the total program for Iraq toward the equipment of two infantry divisions, the items currently scheduled are: vehicles, engineering equipment, supplies and artillery. No mention was made of tanks in the initial program, and no tanks were called for in the division T/<gloss target="#t_O1">O</gloss> &amp; Es. Out of the total program, $372,000 in scout cars, $850,000 in anti-aircraft artillery, $1,290,000 in artillery pieces, and $1,500,000 in ammunition (totalling $4,100,000) are planned for <gloss target="#t_OSP1">OSP</gloss> in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> is able to provide only $3.9 million of this total. Thus, out of the total program of $10.9 million, approximately 30% of this total would be off-shore procured in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>It should be noted that the world-wide mutual defense assistance programs for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1950 through 1955 are presently unfunded in the amount of approximately $500 million and the <gloss target="#t_MDA1">MDA</gloss> losses under Section 1311 of the Appropriation Act of 1954<note n="4" xml:id="d172fn4">Not further identified.</note> result in an additional shortage of $228 million. From this it can be readily seen <pb xml:id="pg_325" n="325" facs="0353"/>that any provisions for tanks to Iraq in the <gloss target="#t_MDA1">MDA</gloss> Program for the fiscal year 1956 would have to be accomplished at the expense of other priority items in the existing <gloss target="#t_MDA1">MDA</gloss> Programs for Iraq or higher priority programs for other countries. It is believed that US military objectives in Iraq are not sufficient to justify a higher priority than those defined for other countries of the area, nor to validate an additional request to Congress for funds to finance US or Centurion tanks for Iraq, as grant aid.</p>
                        <p>The current programmed and planned programs for furnishing military end items through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956 to Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Pakistan amount to $1.3 billion. No information is available as to United Kingdom programmed and planned expenditures during this period, but these are understood to be nominal.</p>
                        <p>2. Difficulties might be expected with Congress on the general principle of off-shore procurement in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> for Middle Eastern countries. The Congressional attitude would be affected by sensitivity over the relation to the Israel problem.</p>
                        <p>3. The establishment of a ratio between equipment sold by the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and off-shore procured by the US, particularly the 7-to-l ratio suggested by the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, would set an undesirable pattern. The US might find itself confronted by demands that the same ratio be applied to other countries.</p>

                        <p>The Jerusalem question is becoming complicated.<note n="2" xml:id="d173fn2">On July 22, <persName corresp="#p_LEB1">Lawson</persName> reminded the Department of the Israeli Government’s “intense and persistent efforts to obtain recognition of Jerusalem Foreign Office”. He pointed out that the United States had been able to avoid the issue as long as the Prime Minister was also Foreign Minister, since <persName corresp="#p_LEB1">Lawson</persName> could call on the Prime Minister either in Jerusalem or at his Tel Aviv office, but the general elections scheduled for July 26 might bring to power a new government in which the Foreign Minister was someone other than the Prime Minister. He urged the Department to develop an agreed policy with other interested nations and to forward instructions to him. (Telegram 45 from Tel Aviv; <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> 601.1184A/7–2255)</note> I will try to <pb xml:id="pg_326" n="326" facs="0354"/>simplify the present situation. There is attached a proposed message to Tel Aviv<note n="3" xml:id="d173fn3">See <ref target="#d176">Document 176</ref>.</note> proposing a new procedure to be put into effect following the Israeli elections and the expected installation of <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> as Prime Minister and <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> as Foreign Minister. Both positions are now held by <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>. In effect the proposed U.S. position would recognize the practical situation, and it would be made clear to the Israelis that the U.S legal view re Jerusalem had not changed.</p>
                        <p>There is also attached a copy of a message which the British Embassy in Washington received this morning regarding Jerusalem.<note n="4" xml:id="d173fn4">No copy of this message has been found in Department of State files.</note> The proposed British position provides, in effect, for a continuation of present practice. The British Ambassador would continue to call on <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> (as Prime Minister) in Jerusalem. Lesser officials of the British Embassy would call on lesser Israeli officials in Jerusalem or at the Israeli Liaison Office in Tel Aviv. The British Ambassador would not call on <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> (as Foreign Minister) in Jerusalem. The chief British argument against relaxing on Jerusalem is that we will be giving something away to the Israelis prior to a settlement of the Palestine problem. This is particularly important in the light of Alpha.</p>
                        <p>This latter argument has some force, although we would not in actuality be giving up a point of substance, since we would have made clear to the Israelis that a call on the Israel Foreign Minister in Jerusalem did not indicate a change of U.S. policy. However, before adopting either our own or the British position, perhaps we should obtain Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LEB1">Lawson</persName>’s views? It is therefore recommended that you sign the attached telegram.</p>

Invite your attention Embdes 95 July 20<note n="2" xml:id="d174fn2">Not printed (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 661.74/7–2055)</note> evaluating Egyptian-Soviet bloc relations and describing Soviet capabilities capitalize on important points at issue between US and Egypt.</p>
                        <p>While <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> continues follow anti-Communist line on domestic front we must recognize danger to US objectives arising from Soviet ability present program of parallel action with Egyptians on several important issues of foreign policy and fact that more experienced men than <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> and his advisors have been beguiled into opening road for Communist subversion by less tempting prospects than those offered Egypt by Soviet. Despite increase of moral prestige which we believe has accrued to US as result of apparent sincerity US conduct at Geneva Conference, reduction of international tension which should ensue may be expected facilitate Soviet efforts encourage this regime believe it can safely pursue course of expanding cooperation with Cominform bloc.</p>
                        <p>Only US has the capability of checking growing Soviet influence this area and this can only be accomplished through a coordinated positive program designed convince the Egyptian Government that despite numerous issues in which our short term objectives do not coincide close cooperation with the US and other Western powers offers Egypt maximum opportunity of achieving its long-run political, economic and social objectives.</p>
                        <p>Embassy has forwarded individual recommendations covering some of the most important elements which should be included in such a program. Am encouraged by proposed policy line pertaining <gloss target="#t_ESS1">ESS</gloss> and Turk-Iraqi Pact (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 107 July 15<note n="3" xml:id="d174fn3">In this telegram, the Department informed the Embassy that the United States supported, encouraged, and welcomed the conclusion of the Baghdad Pact, but that, at the present time, the United States was not contemplating adherence to it. Conversely, the Department believed that “Egyptian-Syrian-Saudi Arabian pact will serve no useful purpose since it does not contain necessary elements area defense.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 780.5/7–1555)</note>) which should somewhat reduce <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s fears that US objectives this area would result in isolation of Egypt. Forthcoming US decision regarding sale military equipment may be of decisive importance. Our ability convince Egyptians of our long-run sympathetic and effective interest in economic cooperation will be affected by US cotton policy.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_328" n="328" facs="0356"/>
                        <p>From long term point of view project for high dam at Aswan can potentially be developed into single most important factor influencing Egyptian economy during latter half this century a development which might well have correspondingly important implications in creating atmosphere conducive to greater political stability. It seems therefore important that it be made evident in <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> consideration this matter that US has sympathetic interest in contributing towards progress this project.</p>
                        <p>We may be able follow with specific recommendations on subject Egyptian-Sudan relations in a subsequent despatch.</p>
                        <p>While fully realize complexities which make early action difficult, believe we should do our utmost in view situation outlined Embdes 95 to take some constructive move in our relations with Egypt. If we do not, present “drift” will surely continue with potentially dangerous results which I believe in end will surely affect more of Middle East area than Egypt alone.</p>

                        <p>153. For Secretary. Reference <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 172, July 26.<note n="2" xml:id="d175fn2">The Secretary informed <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> in telegram 172 that he was considering issuing <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> an invitation to visit the United States, but first wished to have <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName>’s views. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 033.7411/7–2655)</note> Greatly appreciate your query re <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> visit. Have thought often of recommending visit but have held off in deference crowded schedule you and President must have and desire if possible see visit take place after beginning of more favorable trends here. We will have opportunity to accomplish much more if, prior to visit, pendulum in Egyptian-United States relations could by other means be started again toward United States. In that case visit would add momentum rather than be used as effort stop present backward swing. Hope we will succeed by fall in improving situation, but in any case, would recommend visit by about that time. Hope you can see your way clear give us positive decision on as many as possible my outstanding <pb xml:id="pg_329" n="329" facs="0357"/>recommendations to Department which would pave way for best results.</p>
                        <p>In view delicacy our relations and fact that opposition to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> is essentially anti-American, feel he would prefer some positive accomplishments prior visit rather than come with usual hat in hand approach. My present estimation is that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> could under these conditions return with honor as international statesman and some sense of achievement from talks with President and other top-ranking officials and would be less inclined to think in terms of booty in tradition other foreign visitors.</p>
                        <p>While I assume your proposal of visit associated with United States objectives re achieving Arab-Israeli settlement, more specific connection not clear. During discussions with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> you and President may be able make final determination whether we should continue hope that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> will play an effective role toward achievement of settlement. In this connection careful consideration must be given to effect of your proposed speech outlining suggested formula for settlement of Arab-Israeli issues on timing of visit. If speech preceded visit I think it would result in situation here which would cause <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> weigh with utmost <gloss target="#t_CARE1">care</gloss> acceptance of invitation. Made shortly after <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s return it could wipe out benefits of visit in public mind and, perhaps more important, risk jeopardizing his position.</p>
                        <p>I definitely would like to see <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> invited to United States as, in spite of all our difficulties here, he is the rare symbol of a Government in Middle East which is really working for development and welfare people and, hampered though he is, is still relatively free and powerful in comparison most Middle East politicians. A <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> convinced of mutuality of our interest is still best chance of making progress in large part of Middle East and of moving on Arab-Israeli problem.</p>
                        <p>Know of no local factors preventing visit in fall but assume that beginning December <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> will be preoccupied with problems connected with projected Parliament.</p>
                        <p>In view above considerations believe you and Department in best position judge favorable time of visit.</p>

Ambassador to attend at his discretion social and official functions in Jerusalem but endeavor minimize practice and avoid functions carrying special connotation acceptance Jerusalem as capital, e.) U.S. may if necessary issue press statement explaining that arrangements intended only to facilitate practical conduct of business and do not imply any change in US policy re future Jerusalem. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to be requested minimize press comment on changes.

                            </item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he was leaving for Cairo tomorrow on consultation and welcomed the opportunity to obtain the Secretary’s views on various United States-Egyptian matters prior to his personal report to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>. The first item he wished to present was the pending Egyptian request to purchase arms in the United States. He said Egypt had endeavored to obtain armaments from us on three previous occasions, the first two having been refused pending a Suez settlement and the third, brought to Washington … having simply produced no results. (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> pointed out that the Egyptian Government had not made a formal application for the arms on the list … because Egypt had wanted special terms of payment or perhaps a direct or indirect gift of the armaments, which had complicated the request. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName> smiled his concurrence.)</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he knew of no basic political objection to the sale of arms to Egypt for defense purposes. The US was reluctant to contribute to an arms race in the Middle East and was aware that the Israeli Government would probably ask to buy arms as soon as it learned of sales to Egypt. Nevertheless, he did not want Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> to think that we were trying to prevent Egypt from being able to defend itself. Instructions would be sent to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> as soon as cost and availability information were obtained from the Defense Department, which he hoped would be in a few days.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName> hoped we could make a special price to Egypt. The Secretary said he thought we would have to deal with all countries in the area on an equal basis. For example, Saudi Arabia had recently bought B–26 planes from us. We could hardly sell to Egypt at a different price. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName> pointed out that Israel already had superior armament to Egypt and that some concession to Egypt would merely tend to redress the balance. He was <pb xml:id="pg_333" n="333" facs="0361"/>aware that an outright gift of arms could be made only if Egypt signed certain agreements required by US legislation. He wondered if we could not increase our economic aid by, say, $10,000,000 and allow Egypt to pay for the arms with foreign exchange which would be released by this amount. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> pointed out that the Egyptian Government had not raised the question of terms of payment in the present case. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName> said, smiling. “I am raising it right now.” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> suggested that the first step was to obtain the cost and availability figures.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName> said his second point was to urge increased economic aid for Egypt. The Secretary asked what the aid amount had been last year. The Ambassador said, “About $40,000,000.” The Secretary thought this was considerable and remarked, pleasantly, that Egypt would be fortunate if its aid during the coming year was not reduced along with most other countries. He emphasized our desire to do everything we could for Egypt but that other requirements and available appropriations must also be taken into consideration.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said his third point concerned the Sudan. He recalled that Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> had spoken to the Secretary on this point in San Francisco, and repeated the Egyptian Government’s desire for US assistance in bringing about closer relations between Egypt and the Sudan. He hoped that some kind of federation could be achieved. The Secretary said that in principle he was inclined to agree that confederation was preferable to the setting up of innumerable weak independent states which could not defend themselves. He was unable to say what we could do in the Sudan, if anything, and thought our political influence there was quite small. However, he would take the Egyptian Government’s views under consideration. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName> said that the most difficult question at the moment concerned the division of the Nile waters. The Secretary asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> to look into this question to see if we could help the negotiations along and agreed that just division of these waters was highly desirable.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName>’s last point concerned the High Aswan Dam. He said this was the most important element in Egyptian economic development and that without it Egypt could not make progress. He was greatly disappointed that the International Bank seemed to be continually raising new difficulties now related to upper waters in the Sudan, and he hoped the US Government would use its influence with the Bank to speed the negotiations.</p>
                        <p>At the close of the conversation, the Secretary asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName> to assure Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> that while the US Government supported the “northern tier” concept, he had never had in mind doing anything which would challenge Egypt’s place as <pb xml:id="pg_334" n="334" facs="0362"/>the leader of the Arab States. He said Egypt was entitled to this both by history and present position and strength. Moreover, he had full confidence in Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> and was anxious to do everything possible to help him succeed. The US had many demands from foreign nations for political and economic support and could not always do everything which all nations would like. However, he was determined to conduct the foreign policy of the United States on a moral basis and to deal as honestly and fairly with every nation as he possibly could. He felt it of extreme importance that at least one powerful nation in the world today should base its foreign policy on principle. He asked the Ambassador to remind Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> that US policy today, based on justice and fairness to all countries in the Middle East, was much better than it had ever been since the creation of Israel. He hoped the Prime Minister would believe in our genuine support and good will towards him personally.</p>
                        <p>(Subsequently, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName> told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WF1">Wilkins</persName>, separately, that he was extremely pleased with the Secretary’s statements.)</p>

                        <p>“In recent days representatives of the Governments of Lebanon, Syria and Jordan have suggested that I postpone my visit until the latter part of September. They have pointed out that the new Government of Syria may not be established until some time during that month.</p>
                        <p>I appreciate the problems arising from the Syrian elections and want to accommodate the Arab Governments to the fullest possible extent. While I find that a postponement until the end of September is not possible, I am prepared to make one further postponement in view of these representations. I propose arriving in the area about August 24, visiting Amman, Beirut and perhaps Cairo for discussion of detail, then proceeding to Damascus about September 5 for <pb xml:id="pg_335" n="335" facs="0363"/>similar discussions. If circumstances warrant, I will be pleased to follow these conversations by a meeting with the Foreign Ministers concerned at any place named by them.”</p>

                        <p>The British Ambassador called by appointment made at his request. He handed the Secretary the following letter:<note n="2" xml:id="d180fn2">The original of <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName>’ letter, August 2, is <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>“My dear Secretary of State: You will recall that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> undertook to seek the authority of his Cabinet colleagues to make a statement on Alpha the day after your statement is issued. Draft texts for both these statements were discussed and provisionally agreed by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> in London.<note n="3" xml:id="d180fn3">See the enclosures to <ref target="#d169">Document 169</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>“The Cabinet have now agreed that if your statement is on the lines of this draft Her Majesty’s Government should issue a supporting statement, subject to assurances by the United States Government<note n="4" xml:id="d180fn4">According to telegram 413 from London, August 3, the British Cabinet reached these decisions on July 28. (Department of State, Central Files, 684A.86/8–355)</note> on:</p>
                        <p>(a) their ultimate adherence to the Turco-Iraqi Pact; and</p>
                        <p>(b) their readiness to make a substantial financial contribution towards the supply of British tanks to Iraq. I understand that this point has already been discussed by the President and the Prime Minister.</p>
                        <p>“The Cabinet also invited Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> to suggest two amendments to your draft statement. The first of these would be to omit the words “in every respect” after the phase “not designed to be permanent frontiers” in Section 3 of the draft. The second would be to restore to Section 1 some reference to the possibility that some <pb xml:id="pg_336" n="336" facs="0364"/>of the Arab refugees who formerly lived in Israel might be allowed to return to their homes. Yours sincerely, <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger Makins</persName>”.</p>
                        <p>In supplementing orally the above letter Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger</persName> referred to condition A and said that the British do not expect that US assurance on this point would be communicated to anybody else at this time nor obviously referred to in the US statement except possibly by general inference. He added that we might, of course, subsequently wish to inform the Iraqiis either generally or specifically. The Secretary assumed that the British understood that no assurance on this point could be given except subject to US constitutional requirements, i.e., Senatorial ratification.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the last paragraph concerning suggested amendments to the US draft statement Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger</persName> thought that the first is only a drafting change. The second was designed to fill a gap which the British felt existed in the US draft, namely, the omission of any reference to the return of refugees to Israel. The Secretary said he did not recall the exact language of the statement which he would look at again, but it was his impression that the point was covered at least by inference if not specifically. Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> is sympathetic to the apparent US concept that the statement should be general rather than specific but it was their impression that there are some specifics mentioned and, in the circumstances, this apparent omission might raise questions. The British also contemplated a broadly drawn statement but believed that if any details were included, all of them should be mentioned. In this connection Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger</persName> said the British have a particular preoccupation with the problem of Arab lands outside villages.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger</persName> turned to requested assurance B, and remarked that he thought the President had a letter from the Prime Minister on that subject.<note n="5" xml:id="d180fn5">See <ref target="#d171fn2">footnote 2, Document 171</ref>.</note> The Secretary was not sure of the status of that problem but said he would look into it.</p>

                        </dateline>
                        <p>DEAR MR. SECRETARY: I refer to your letter of 21 July 1955<note n="2" xml:id="d181fn2">
                                <ref target="#d167">Document 167</ref>.</note> requesting Department of Defense concurrence in a governmental position that we are prepared to consider supplying a portion of the equipment requested by the Government of Egypt. Reference is also made to Department of State memorandum, <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss>–8–2A, dated 7 July 1955,<note n="3" xml:id="d181fn3">Not printed. (Department of State, Central Files, 774.5–<gloss target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss>/7–755)</note> which requested pricing and availability data for the requested equipment and assigned Egypt Case No. 12 to this transaction.</p>
                        <p>In view of the overall political considerations indicated in your letter, the Department of Defense is prepared to supply to the Government of Egypt on a reimbursable basis the equipment requested. The delivery of such equipment is to be in consonance with the provisions of Section 106 of the Mutual Security Act of 1954, as amended.<note n="4" xml:id="d181fn4">The Mutual Security Act of 1955, which became Public Law 138 on July 8, 1955, amended the Mutual Security Act of 1954. For text of the act, see 69 Stat. 283.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is attached data reflecting estimated costs and probable availability for the equipment requested by the Government of Egypt.<note n="5" xml:id="d181fn5">Not printed.</note> Availability is contingent on prompt receipt of a firm order and funds to cover purchases.</p>
                        <p>The following comments are made regarding the requested items:</p>
                        <p>(a) If Napalm Bombs are sold to the Egyptian Government it will not only contribute to its offensive capability but will establish a precedent for making sales of this item. It is suggested that this item not be included in any list of equipment approved for supply to Egypt.</p>
                        <p>(b) B–26 aircraft are still maintained in active <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> inventories, however 30 to 33 could be made available either in the United States or from the <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> in Europe. Aircraft made available from either source will require complete rehabilitation, costs for which are shown. Costs for necessary follow-on support and equipment, based on a 200 flying hour program per aircraft, per annum, are also shown.</p>
                        <p>(c) An expedited delivery of six aircraft could be made in December 1955.</p>
                        <p>(d) An expedited delivery of twenty M4A3 tanks could be made to the shipping agent of the Egyptian Government within 60 days after receipt of a firm order and funds.</p>
                        <p>(e) Flame Thrower Tanks are not available for supply.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_338" n="338" facs="0366"/>
                        <p>The Department of Defense recommends that before a commitment is made to the Government of Egypt careful consideration be given to:</p>
                        <p>(a) Insuring that the supplying of this equipment to Egypt does not set off an arms race between the Arab States and Israel. This may be done by controlling the scope, character and phasing of delivering this equipment and of any material sold to Israel to minimize the possibility of its use for aggressive purposes. The Department of Defense is prepared to periodically supply, in accordance with the availability shown, only that portion of the equipment so desired by the Department of State.</p>
                        <p>(b) The capability of Egypt to purchase this matériel without damaging its economy.</p>
                        <p>(c) The feasibility of urging Egypt to refrain from signing the Egyptian-Saudi-Syria pact on the basis that the receipt of this equipment will raise the relative military strength of Egypt and should allay fears that the United States is not interested in her welfare. A diminution in Egyptian opposition to the Baghdad Pact and an end to Egyptian pressure for the formation of the <gloss target="#t_ESS1">ESS</gloss> Pact could forestall any possible Iraqi apprehension over this sale of U.S. Arms to Egypt, and thereby facilitate continued Iraqi support of the “Northern Tier” concept.</p>

                        <p>I discussed the matter of <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s proposal for the offshore procurement of Centurion Tanks for Iraq. The President said that he had been impressed by <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s representation, that if we were going to go ahead with Alpha we would have to give Nuri something to prevent his overthrow and to keep momentum behind the Northern tier concept.</p>
                        <p>I said that we did not view Nuri’s situation as so precarious, but that no doubt it would be useful to do something to sweeten, for Nuri, a proposal which the Arabs might consider as a pro-Israel move—even though the Israeli would consider it a pro-Arab move.</p>
                        <p>I mentioned to the President that our Israeli relations would not be improved if we gave on a grant basis heavy items such as Centurion Tanks to Iraq.</p>

                        <p>After discussions, the President called up Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> and the following program was agreed to:</p>
                        <p>(a) We would advise the British that we would use, of this year’s budget, funds to provide for the offshore procurement of ten Centurion Tanks to cost about a million and a quarter dollars. This was on the assumption that the British would contribute two. We would explain to the British the loss of <gloss target="#t_MDA1">MDA</gloss> funds as a result of the cut in this year’s appropriation.</p>
                        <p>(b) We would indicate an intention to seek funds for the offshore procurement of about 40 more Centurion Tanks for Iraq in the next fiscal year with a comparable <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> matching.</p>
                        <p>(c) We would accelerate deliveries under our present Iraq program.</p>
                        <p>(d) We would find some additional scout cars and the like which, being in an obsolete or used condition, could sweeten the present pot without any appreciably additional charge against <gloss target="#t_MDA1">MDA</gloss> funds.</p>

                        <p>I told the British Ambassador with reference to Centurion Tanks to Iraq as follows:</p>
                        <p>(1) The Defense Department would, although faced with serious financial difficulties because of appropriation cuts, try to squeeze out for this year the offshore procurement in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> of ten Centurion Tanks at a cost of about a million and a quarter on the assumption that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would match this with two.</p>
                        <p>(2) We would try to sweeten this years military pot for Iraq by accelerating deliveries and perhaps by adding some fresh items.</p>
                        <p>(3) That we would consider sympathetically a further contribution to the Centurion program in connection with our next years request to the Congress.</p>
                        <p>(4) We understand that this action on our part is not designed to set a general pattern for the Near East but to meet a special situation anticipated to arise from the announcement of Alpha and <pb xml:id="pg_341" n="341" facs="0369"/>the difficulty faced by Nuri in meeting Arab opposition to his participation in the Northern tier concept.</p>
                        <p>I had told the Ambassador points 1, 2, and 3 prior to talking with <persName>Anderson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName>, et als in my anteroom. After this talk I went back and added pointed 4 and also asked him not to inform his government of what I had said until I could clear it more definitely which I said I would do the first of next week. We should, therefore, advise him definitely and in writing along the foregoing lines by Monday or Tuesday.</p>

                        <p rend="center">COMMENTS ON ALPHA FROM CHIEFS OF MISSION AT AMMAN, BAGHDAD, BEIRUT, CAIRO, DAMASCUS, TEL AVIV, PARIS<note n="5" xml:id="d185fn5">The information developed in this summary was drawn from the following telegrams: 56 from Amman, August 5; 101 from Baghdad, August 6; 127 from Beirut, August 2; 159 from Cairo, July 30; 100 from Damascus, August 4; 87 from Tel Aviv, August 4; and 490 from Paris, August 2. All these telegrams are in Department of State, Central File 684A.86.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. Tactics</p>
                        <p>The interested governments should be informed of the proposed statement about 24 hours in advance by the American Chiefs of Mission. After the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> supporting statement is issued, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Chief of Mission should make an appropriate approach. In both cases, stress should be placed upon the desirability of studying the statement, exercising restraint, and not taking an immediate position. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> strongly recommends that in order to avoid adverse effects on over-all US-French relations, the French be provided two weeks’ advance notice and, in general, be made to feel we consider them in the same category as the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HDR1">Heath</persName> suggests we may wish to approach the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in advance.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Response on Parr of Governments and Public</p>
                        <p>The Governments of Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan at best will probably be cautious in their response and refrain from taking a definite position until after Arab consultations. Unfavorable reactions on the part of Egypt and Syria are foreseen. In all cases, the Arab public probably will immediately reject the proposals. Ambassador Gallman is less apprehensive than the British over the effect of the statement in Iraq. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LEB1">Lawson</persName> expects outright and vigorous opposition on the part of both the Israel Government and public.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. Special Security Precautions</p>
                        <p>Our missions anticipate that demonstrations may occur but believe that they can be handled by the local authorities.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">IV. Publicity</p>
                        <p>No publicity before the statement is advocated. Authentic texts in Arabic, French and English, together with explanatory material, should be on hand for immediate distribution afterwards. We should be prepared to use all information media to explain the statement and refute distortions. Ambassador Gallman advises having ready a statement rebutting the contention that the proposal is a planned follow-up of the Turko-Iraqi Pact.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">V. Presence in Countries of Chiefs of Mission and Heads of Government</p>
                        <p>All of our Chiefs of Mission plan to be at their posts in September. With the possible exception of Prime Minister Nuri, who may visit Turkey from September 10 to 15, the heads of government are expected to be at home.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">VI. Comments on Text of Statement</p>
                        <p>Few comments were received from the Arab states on the text of the statement. There was a consensus, however, that reference to repatriation of a portion of the refugees should be included. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LEB1">Lawson</persName> strongly urged that the statement be generalized and confined to an analysis of the problem and outline of the principles in accordance with which it might be solved. If this is not possible, he believes we should specify the concessions to be made by the Arab states as well as those expected from Israel. He notes that the draft British supporting statement confines itself to an analysis of the problem and to general principles. (Note: The revised August 4, 1955 draft of your statement is considerably more general than the text sent to the field.)<note n="6" xml:id="d185fn6">For a copy of this revised draft, see <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi>

                        <p>This afternoon Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> discussed with the Secretary the redraft of a proposed letter to Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger Makins</persName> with respect to Centurion tanks for Iraq (Tab A<note n="2" xml:id="d187fn2">Drafted by <persName corresp="#p_BWC1">Burdett</persName> on August 10; not attached to the source text but filed <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName>’s initial draft, which he sent to <persName>Dulles</persName> with a covering memorandum of August 8, is <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> Alpha—Memos and corres., July l–Aug. 26 (day of <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss>’s speech).</note>). Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> pointed out that this redraft incorporated the Secretary’s two suggestions: (1) that phraseology be inserted which would insure that the British would not be in a position to take entire credit in the matter; (2) that American action in supplying ten Centurion tanks on a grant basis which had been obtained by offshore procurement was contingent on British support for the Alpha statement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> also noted that he had with him a proposed telegram to the American Embassy in Baghdad inquiring whether in fact the Iraqis wanted Centurion tanks or would possibly prefer American tanks.<note n="3" xml:id="d187fn3">Not attached to the source text. Telegram 93 to Baghdad, August 10, informed Ambassador Gallman of the conversations with the British and requested information as to Iraqi preferences.

                        </p>
                        <p>During the course of the ensuing discussion the following points were touched-on by the Secretary:</p>
                        <p>1. The Secretary speculated on the Congressional reaction to the possibility of American adherence to the Turko-Iraqi Pact. The Secretary mentioned in passing that he did not like open-ended <pb xml:id="pg_346" n="346" facs="0374"/>pacts but preferred those with a definite time limit which might be extended as necessary.</p>
                        <p>2. The Secretary was inclined to believe that the British would take entire credit for the provision of Centurion tanks for Iraq in spite of the fact that the letter provided that no intimation be given to the Iraqis by either the British or ourselves before the United States made its formal approach.</p>
                        <p>3. The Secretary raised the question of the United States selling the ten Centurions to the Iraqis which had been obtained from Britain by offshore procurement. He wondered whether this were possible and checked with Mr. Nolting, who stated that it had been done in one or two isolated cases but was not generally the practice. The Secretary wondered whether it should not be stated in the proposed draft letter to Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger Makins</persName> that the Centurion tanks would be supplied by the United States to Iraq on a grant basis in the United States program.</p>
                        <p>4. The Secretary wondered whether the Iraqis wanted British tanks or would prefer American tanks. The proposed telegram was discussed and wording was added cautioning the American Ambassador regarding any queries he might put to the Iraqis regarding tanks.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> observed that any discussion with Nuri concerning the supply of Centurions to Iraq would probably leak and would prove an unfortunate backdrop for the Alpha statement. It would appear that the United States had abandoned its objective position, giving tanks to Iraq unconditionally but making the security treaty for Israel conditional on cooperation in Alpha. The Secretary said it might be better, if we decided to have the British tell Nuri that they were informed the prospects were good and withhold any U.S. statement until later.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary concluded that he felt that it would be sufficient for the moment to send the telegram to the American Embassy in Baghdad. Following the reply as to whether the Iraqis wanted Centurion tanks, further consideration could be given to the proposed letter to Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger Makins</persName>.<note n="4" xml:id="d187fn4">See <ref target="#d191">Document 191</ref>.</note> He supposed that it could be held up another day or two.</p>

                        <p>At 9:15 a.m. on August 11, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> met with President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> to review a number of policy matters, one of which was <pb xml:id="pg_347" n="347" facs="0375"/>the question of furnishing Centurion tanks to Iraq. According to <persName>Dulles</persName>’ memorandum of conversation, the following was said:</p>
                        <p>“We discussed the matter of Centurion tanks for Iraq. I said we were in somewhat of a dilemma on whether to let the British get the credit for these tanks or to seek credit ourselves, in which case we would get a corresponding debit from Israel. The President reaffirmed his often-expressed view that we should encourage the British to take the lead in the Middle East and not seek to compete with them in that respect. He said that he thought it was better for us to let the British deal in this tank matter directly with the Iraqi.” (Eisenhower Library, Dulles Papers, Meetings with the President)</p>

                        <p>1. Israelis insist the “senior officer,” who is to represent the parties for the purpose of the commander’s agreement, be well defined term and want such officer to be the local commander or some one of direct relationship to that commander. Egyptians are unwilling that “senior officer” be local commander as they object to direct contact between parties at this level. <persName>Burns</persName> of opinion that Gohar contemplates Egyptian representative to be officer of lieutenant colonel rank who will be directly subordinate to War Ministry, and thus subject to Gohar, as well as to Egyptian General commanding Gaza sector. This arrangement would be satisfactory under circumstances and <persName>Burns</persName> has informed Israelis that he is willing to give his “personal guarantee” that Egyptian representative will have requisite authority. Gohar’s objection to delineation of precise relationship of senior officer to Egyptian forces Gaza based on fear that he might be accused of promoting direct talks between Egypt and Israel.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_348" n="348" facs="0376"/>
                        <p>2. Gohar refused direct telephone link between parties, although will accept passing of messages through United Nations observers stationed at kilo 95. Israelis insist on direct telephone communication.</p>
                        <p>3. Israel objection to attendance United Nations observer at meetings of representatives of parties reinforces belief which Egyptians have always had that Israel desire for Gaza talks and commanders’ agreement merely attempt to bring about direct discussions between two countries. …</p>
                        <p>Concerning other items of agenda, <persName>Burns</persName> stated Israelis unwilling to agree to mixed patrols unless they feel Egyptians will accept barbed wire obstacle. Egyptians do not want obstacle if neutral zone idea not accepted by Israelis. However, <persName>Burns</persName> hopeful that agreement can be reached on some combination of these proposals.</p>
                        <p>Prior to scheduled August 19 meeting <persName>Burns</persName> intends to speak with Lourie of Israel Foreign Office in effort obtain Israel acceptance to Egyptian position on items one and three above if Egyptians will agree direct telephone line. <persName>Burns</persName> not sure whether Gohar objection to telephone line accurately reflects firm Egyptian position and in event he obtains Israel agreement as outlined above he may ask for outside pressure on <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> to gain Egyptian acceptance.<note n="3" xml:id="d189fn3">

                        <p>DEAR MR. AMBASSADOR: I refer to our conversations and correspondence concerning Centurion tanks for Iraq.</p>
                        <p>Off-shore procurement of Centurion tanks faces us with serious financial difficulties because of recent appropriation cuts by the Congress. Nevertheless, we are prepared to purchase in the United Kingdom for Iraq, as part of our grant aid program for the current fiscal year, 10 Centurion tanks if the United Kingdom will provide two. Also, we will explore the possibilities of expediting deliveries to Iraq under our current program and of adding certain other additional items to this program. Our action with respect to the tanks is not intended to set a general pattern for the Near East but only to meet a specific special situation.</p>
                        <p>Members of our staffs can discuss the question of the manner and time for informing the Iraqi Government.</p>
                        <p>Because of the personal interest Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> has expressed to the President, I would appreciate your bringing this letter to his attention.</p>

                        <p>As you will recall, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5428 (Tab C) (the policy paper covering the Near East) provides that if an armed attack occurs by either side in Palestine the United States should impose certain economic sanctions. It further provides that if these sanctions are unsuccessful in causing the aggressor state to withdraw within its own borders, we should consult with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and to the extent practicable with other powers on whether to take concerted action to:</p>
                        <p>(1) Establish a blockade of the attacking state;</p>
                        <p>(2) Use military forces to compel the attacking state to relinquish any territory seized and to withdraw within its own borders.</p>
                        <p>Paragraph 11 of the paper calls for the development of plans, including military plans where appropriate, to support the measures set forth above.</p>
                        <p>When the Gaza situation seemed especially acute last June we submitted a memorandum (Tab A)<note n="2" xml:id="d192fn2">
                                <ref target="#d125">Document 125</ref>.</note> suggesting steps looking toward possible implementation of the economic sanctions. You subsequently discussed this matter with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> and it was agreed that any action taken should be within the United Nations framework.</p>
                        <p>Although the threat of large-scale hostilities has not materialized, an <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> working group has addressed itself to the mechanics by which we would impose economic sanctions if the occasion should arise. So far as I am aware, however, no action within the United States Government has ever been taken to draw up plans against the contingency that military action would be needed.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion</p>
                        <p>The British Embassy approached us some time ago with a request for informal discussion of action to be taken by our two governments, in case of need, in both the economic and military fields.<note n="3" xml:id="d192fn3">See <ref target="#d142">Document 142</ref>.</note> The Embassy said that the British Government, at the “official level” had worked out plans in both fields. We expressed our willingness to have informal exchanges regarding economic sanctions as soon as our own study was completed but said we did not think discussion of military plans would be useful, since no such plans existed in our government.</p>
                        <p>I think the British approach serves as a reminder that we may have been remiss in not carrying out the injunction of paragraph 11 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5428 to develop “military plans as appropriate.” While we all hate to contemplate the possibility of employing military force against either side, it seems to me only prudent to have plans ready <pb xml:id="pg_353" n="353" facs="0381"/>against the possibility that at some time the necessity for such action might arise.</p>
                        <p>In view of the delicacy of the matter, I feel that we should have your personal approval before making a request to the Department of Defense.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation</p>
                        <p>That you approve a strictly secret (and probably oral) request to appropriate officers of the Department of Defense for the initiation of plans for the imposition of military sanctions upon an aggressor in the Arab-Israeli conflict.<note n="4" xml:id="d192fn4">

This message contains account my conversation last evening with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> re sale military equipment.

He recommended that if the United States hoped to dissuade <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> from accepting this proposal and Soviet offers of economic development assistance, it should “try to meet <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s request for purchase of some military equipment for Egyptian pounds.” (Department of State, Central Files, 474.118/8–1555)</note>

Expanded in some detail as to wisdom military personnel discussing matters such as items, availability, shipping, maintenance, spare part situation, etc. Told him also I felt there were items on list which he would find it unnecessary to purchase as many of the TO and <gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss> items for US units probably would be found unnecessary or duplication of what was already on hand. Explained that prices given were lowest possible for US in view of its own regulations and practices with other friendly nations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> took no exception to information he read or my supplementary remarks. He said he thoroughly understood it in his interest that matters I had mentioned be handled by military personnel. For reasons which became immediately obvious he did not object to phased program as I had anticipated. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> said he had just gone through <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> financial situation again with Minister of Finance<note n="6" xml:id="d193fn6">Abdel Moneim Kaissouny.</note> and his dollar position was really far worse than he had realized. He stated they now had a balance of $28 million. (This checks roughly our information. Last report available to Embassy was $34.4 million and Egypt has been losing from $2 million to $4 million per month.) He had asked Minister of Finance to re-study this situation and give him recommendation as to how much could be spent for military equipment. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> said I must realize this was very difficult problem for them and inquired whether we could find some way to let him finance these purchases with Egyptian pounds. I stated I not hopeful that such arrangement could be made. As far as I aware we had not used this practice for any other nation and was certain we would not like precedent to be set. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> said could understand this but after all we no longer selling equipment many places and would I please try. After considerable discussion I agreed consult Department. Matter as left that he also would go again into his own financial situation and we would have further talk later.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Ahmed Hussein</persName> called on me yesterday morning in state obvious concern. He began by stating his belief there was beginning to be general improvement in US-Egyptian relations as far as <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> was concerned. He told me in great detail of his last talks with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> and argumentation he had used, including encouraging conversations he had prior to his leaving Washington, particularly with Secretary.<note n="3" xml:id="d194fn3">See <ref target="#d178">Document 178</ref>.</note> He felt these talks supplementing my own efforts were beginning to bring positive results. There were new difficulties however which caused him great concern.</p>
                        <p>They had discussed the internal situation, apparently in extremely blunt terms. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> was determined to broaden base of government next January but <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName> was trying to convince <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> he could not afford to wait that long. He told <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> he was surrounded by “third raters” and machinery of government under <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> was such that changes must be promptly made. He indicated he had pointed out to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> danger of Salem brothers, stressing importance of not losing friendship with west and inadvisability of tactics some top government people, particularly Salah Salem. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> later called together <persName corresp="#p_AGAH1">Hakim Amer</persName>, Salah Salem, Zakaria and others to hear <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName>’s general views as to foreign policy course Egypt should follow. <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName> this time added he was appalled by same anti-American “record” now played every Egyptian officer who visited America and it was perfectly obvious that before leaving Egypt they were being systematically worked on by communists and communist sympathizers.</p>
                        <p>Following this joint meeting, <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> saw <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName> again alone and went into detail on internal problems he faced. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> said he had to let certain things happen in Egypt with which he did not agree in order to keep support of army and <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> at this stage. He agreed with <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName> that <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> must go and asked his help in trying to plan steps that must be taken to this end. Discussing his need for support army officers <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> revealed to <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName> magnitude of recent Russian offers which was creating nearly impossible situation for him. <persName corresp="#p_SDT1">Shepilov</persName> had brought word Russia prepared go all out in <pb xml:id="pg_356" n="356" facs="0384"/>assisting Egypt.<note n="4" xml:id="d194fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_SDT1">Dimitri Trofimovich Shepilov</persName>, the editor of <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi>, visited Egypt July 21–29.</note> Russia would finance high dam and Egypt could repay in cotton over period up to thirty years and in terms suitable to Egypt. Russia would also be of great assistance to Egypt in economic development and technical assistance and Russia prepared to put large funds in both fields. Egypt need not be fearful of US cotton policy as Russia and communist bloc needed Egyptian cotton and suitable barter arrangements could always be made. As regards military, Russia willing to increase her latest offers substantially and would provide Egypt with MIG aircraft and latest weapons quick delivery payable in cotton. (<persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName> states he was not shown details of Russian offer in military field but <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> did at one point mention 100 MIGs and 200 tanks. He also mentioned jet bombers which Russia is willing to sell for <gloss target="#t_LE2">LE</gloss> 37000.) Military shipments could begin to arrive within 30 days. (<persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had not given <persName corresp="#p_SDT1">Shepilov</persName> definitive reply.)</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName> that 3 or 4 days ago Moscow radio announced <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> prepared give free military assistance to Egypt. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had taken steps keep this out of press although fact such statement made was getting around. He felt compelled bring text of monitored announcement up at <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> meeting. General sentiment had been Egypt should not refuse such an offer if it were in fact officially made. <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName> later brought me a transcript which had been used in <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> meeting. It had been broadcast from Moscow on August 10 in Arabic. Most of transcript was published here after <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had crossed out portion dealing with military equipment which translated as follows: “very highly informed sources announced that the Soviet Union is ready to supply Egypt with modern arms and military equipment free. These sources expect that negotiations would take place between the Soviet Union and Egypt about this subject in the coming days.”<note n="5" xml:id="d194fn5">The Department informed <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> on August 17 that, according to <gloss target="#t_FBIS1">FBIS</gloss>, “no broadcast made by <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> on or about August 10 resembling that quoted by <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName>.” (Telegram 300 to Cairo; Department of State, Central Files, 474.118/8–1555) <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> replied that “There absolutely no doubt my mind that <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> believe broadcast was made and that <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> meeting was held on this subject.” (Telegram 253 from Cairo, August 18; <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> 774.56/8–1855)</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName> stated Israeli radio had picked up this portion and used it in two broadcasts along with appropriate references about the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName> he (<persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>) getting himself in real box on this one. He realized communists had of late directed their activities toward army as controlling factor in determination Egyptian policy. He knew where accepting all these Russian offers would lead. He determined have truly “independent policy” and realized acquisition Soviet arms was road to “domination”. However, his officers were <pb xml:id="pg_357" n="357" facs="0385"/>desperate for arms and word was getting out that these new offers had been made. With the army in this mood and with its general lack of confidence in America, and with <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> certainly deeply divided on issue, he had to reckon with fact he would be placing his position in jeopardy in advocating turn-down of Russian offer in favoring use limited Egyptian resources to purchase arms. Such a course would appear nonsensical to average officer who convinced west determined keep Egypt weaker than Israel and who saw no danger accepting arms from any source available. Having Russian made weapons, they argue, would not make them communists so why this hesitation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName> recounted to me argumentation he had given <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> which was excellently conceived if presented to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> as to me. According to <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName>, however, <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> needed little convincing, he seemed genuinely concerned at Russian motives and primarily interested in how he could marshal sufficient support within <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> and army to turn down Russian offers.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName> appealed to me to think of something dramatic to help <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> in this situation. He stressed that a decision to acquire Soviet arms would not have impact on Egypt alone but could be turning point in history Middle East. He stated that high dam, economic aid, and other matters were obviously important, but paled into relative insignificance compared to question of Russia’s offer of arms under present conditions.</p>
                        <p>I asked what he thought we could do. Egypt would not accept grant assistance now even if offered. He said this was true but it might be very helpful if our response to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> on US purchase terms were as generous as possible. Surely, he said, we could find some way help <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> with his foreign exchange problem so he could buy weapons from US. He also asked if we would consider a request for Egypt to purchase considerably greater quantities of equipment on list presented. I said I thought this latter point quite unlikely. He must realize from practical point of view Egyptian military could not absorb large amounts of equipment in short period of time. He said he knew this but matter was now more psychological than practical. I also stated it seemed to me not in Egypt’s interests to go too far with military equipment at this stage in view obvious reactions. Also, even if equipment were furnished on gratis basis, maintenance of much larger military establishment could not be afforded by Egypt. He nevertheless pleaded that I try think of something that would help <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> now.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName> Middle East had been thrown into chaos, partially if not primarily, by Egyptian tactics, that it obvious Moscow had decided now was time to really move in on this area. He said he completely agreed. However <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> still by far best thing in Egypt <pb xml:id="pg_358" n="358" facs="0386"/>and now needed our help. He felt convinced that if he could get by these present troubles without losing army support, he was determined to get rid of elements that had been causing difficulties.</p>

                        <p>250. General subject Arab-Israeli settlement beginning to appear again in conversation here. When <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName> came to me so concerned re Russian arms situation he stated some dramatic move necessary prevent this controversy from being capitalized on by <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Could we for instance he inquired force quick settlement? I stated did not like word “force” but he entirely correct greater efforts should go towards solution basic problem rather than being satisfied with trying to ward off piecemeal dangers arising from controversy itself. <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName> now is pressing for quick and forceful action on our part to bring some type of immediate settlement.</p>
                        <p>In our discussions last night with <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> reiterated his conviction that even at this late date the year 1955 was still the time to act. We went back over our previous discussions in considerable detail. He said his sense urgency was greater than during our previous conversation and he felt that even on <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> side, <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> might be more willing to act now than “even in six months”.</p>
                        <p>I stated we always seemed to reach about the same point in these talks. Did he really wish to proceed in detail with such talks and if so how should we proceed? There followed a long talk on the Negev and it became obvious that question was no longer one of tactics as to how to proceed. He was rather giving me <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> position that if solution could be found for the Negev satisfactory to Egypt, Egypt would be ready to move forward to rapid and complete settlement. I have now talked to <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> in sufficient detail on elements other than Negev to believe that meeting of minds thereon could be readily reached.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_359" n="359" facs="0387"/>
                        <p>I expressed opinion that any plan to give entire Negev to Jordan was quite out of question, explaining somewhat the obvious reaction and emotions of Israelis. Furthermore, stated that there were concessions elsewhere that should in all logic be made by Israel. One could not contemplate coupling these with such a large loss of territory. For instance if Arabs in addition contemplated return of refugees into Israeli territory thus reduced, he must see how impossible this would be. <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> said “don’t quote me, but if we can get a solution to Negev we might be willing take a position that there should be no return of refugees and that Arabs now residing Israel should even have evacuation facilitated”.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> refused to talk in terms of anything resembling a corridor or access rights. What he stressed was rather a “continuity of territory” in the Arab world. Thus Egypt could not contemplate solution which would allow Israel access to Gulf of Elath. This I said would put Israel at the mercy of Suez Canal. He replied, no more than Greece, Italy or others. I stated he must realize Israel had more reason to fear for the future re the Canal than other countries. <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> responded by saying he was not thinking of a settlement that would leave cause for concern but of a real effort being made for establishment of friendly relations which would erase such fears. He remarked that Jews and Arabs had lived together in the past and could do so again if Israel could accept the type of solution he recommended. Israel would really not lose much of a practical value as good lands would not be taken from her.

This was not way to handle problem and secret informal discussions such as this between professionals was the only way to start.

He felt Lester Pearson, whom he greatly admires, was also about to visit both Egypt<note n="3" xml:id="d195fn3">Pearson was in Cairo on November 12.</note> and Israel for same purpose and gave impression he wished he would not.</p>
                        <p>I made no effort bring matter to conclusion or arrange for further discussions because not certain what Department would wish at this stage.

                                <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> reported on this meeting in telegrams 247 and 251 from Cairo, both dated August 17. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 120.1580/8–1755 and 611.74/8–1755, respectively) Telegram 247 stated that <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had reversed his previous position against Egyptian involvement in <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>’s negotiations and now felt the matter should be handled by all Arab states jointly. The Secretary General of the Arab League had therefore called a meeting of Arab diplomatic representatives in Cairo which had unanimously supported an approach to the U.S. Government to recommend that <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>’s trip be delayed. <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> requested that <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> pass this recommendation to Washington, stressing that the delay need be only for a “few weeks” or a month. <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> if he would advise that <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> continue to negotiate directly with the parties most directly concerned. <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> replied that this might be useful, but it might be best for <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> to meet with the entire Arab group together, perhaps in Cairo.</note> attended dinner at home Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName> with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>, General <persName corresp="#p_AGAH1">Hakim Amer</persName>, Zakaria Muhyi Ad-Din. <persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName> also present. First half of long evening devoted non-substantive matters in relaxed atmosphere. Fact that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> willing devote such amount of time to discussions of personal and small talk matters in general line with some change of relations for better here.</p>
                        <p>Afterward we covered nearly every facet American-Egyptian political relations without any new subject being raised. I attempted focus attention on points on which Egypt and United States could cooperate. Urged <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> regard northern tier as solid anti-Communist achievement which in interest Egypt, United States, and West <pb xml:id="pg_361" n="361" facs="0389"/>must under no circumstances be allowed disintegrate. It was of basic importance. Iraq should not continue to be attacked for adherence nor worked upon to recant and drop out. In answer to his complaint Iraq and Turkey constantly seeking additional Arab adherences, I again reassured him United States not enthusiastic over such adherences at this time and sought his reflections as to how this inter-Arab tug-of-war could be eased without setting up rival <gloss target="#t_ESS1">ESS</gloss> which we felt sure would be viewed by Iraq as well as Turkey as directed against them and would therefore tend to perpetuate cleavage and resultant area weakness which we did not desire. Perhaps because a group was present, <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> sought to justify necessity <gloss target="#t_ESS1">ESS</gloss>, but seemed receptive to idea some reconciliation.</p>
                        <p>He thought an all-Arab arrangement in which Iraq could also participate might some day eventuate in supplementing northern tier but not as long as Nuri in power. He made clear he detested Nuri and therefore he could not at present take up my further suggestion that Egypt and Iraq bilaterally talk out their differences on basis continuation Iraqi membership northern tier and Iraq-Egyptian understanding. I had impression, however, he would be open minded about composing differences with whoever might be Nuri’s successor.</p>
                        <p>Considerable time was spent on Egypt’s military weakness vis-à-vis Israel and Western policy of equating Israel with totality Arab States in military aid matters. <persName corresp="#p_AGAH1">Hakim Amer</persName> obviously very sensitive this point. I told him I felt sure United States would welcome an Egypt strong enough not to fear an Israeli attack, but until Arab-Israel quarrel removed a building up of Egyptian might superior to that of Israel would present grave problem to United States and probably not even be in Egypt’s real interest at this time. After real solution to quarrel had been found, I saw no reason why Egyptian strength should be limited by other than load Egypt’s economy could bear and role she might play in strengthening area. I emphasized importance we attached to Egypt along with Turkey and Pakistan as future foci of strength which we desired in Middle East.</p>
                        <p>Question of Russian offers did not come up and I thought it best not to pursue question before other members <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>. Fact that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had chosen present these matters through <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName> believed due desire not to discuss his personal problems with other members of <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> directly with me.</p>
                        <p>Although am somewhat reassured regarding relations here, this does not reduce in importance recommendations Embassy telegram 235.<note n="3" xml:id="d196fn3">See <ref target="#d193fn3">footnote 3, Document 193</ref>.</note> Fact that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> believes this Embassy trying find some method help him with his dollar problem regarding equipment <pb xml:id="pg_362" n="362" facs="0390"/>purchases probably in itself factor for more friendly local relations. Nor does all this reduce in my mind new dangers inherent in Russia’s offers strengthen Egypt, thereby placing her on Arab side of Arab-Israeli conflict.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary telephoned <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Eric Johnston</persName> in New York and said he understood the Arab League was getting into Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>’s party. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> said they had kept them out up to the present time and he felt they would take only a negative attitude. He said they would tell the States involved they would do business with them on this project, although they can consult with whom they wish. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> said the project was the key to the solution to the difficulties in the area. Until the backbone of the resistance was broken, he did not see how the problem could be solved. The best way, he said, of solving the Arab refugee problem was this water project. The Secretary agreed that if it went into the Arab League it would be a morass. On the other hand, we are not prepared to beat down Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> at the moment. He is probably using this as a device to restore his prestige in relation to the Arab League. That is maybe what he is up to. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> thought this perhaps might be true. J. said a cable had come in a while ago to the effect that Lebanon was behind the move to put this in the Arab League.<note n="2" xml:id="d198fn2">Reference is presumably to telegram 139 from Baghdad, August 18, in which Gallman informed the Department that the Lebanese Government had asked Iraq to “side with latter in insisting that <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> discussions be conducted with A[rab] L[eague] in Cairo rather than with individual Arab States.” (Department of State, Central Files, 120.1580/8–1855)</note> This was not true of Egypt and if this is correct that puts quite a different aspect on the situation. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> said if he could have a talk with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> he would stress the futility of allowing this to go into the Arab League. He said he realized the difficulties of trying to put this over and was not nearly as sanguine of success as he was a month ago. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> said he knew how helpful it would be to the Secretary if he could put this thing over and he still hoped it was possible.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he may have to make his statement sooner than he thought. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> said if there were repercussions he might be able to temper them while he was over there. The Secretary asked if J. felt he should go right away in spite of this business. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> said he did think he should go. He said that Saudi Arabia and Iraq were at each other’s throats and did not appear to be interested in a solution. We appreciated Egypt’s help and were delighted she was taking a renewed interest in the project. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>
                            <pb xml:id="pg_364" n="364" facs="0392"/>reiterated how important it was for him to get out there and said if we waited two or three weeks the different States would not have the courage to resist and it will get into the Arab League and never get out. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> said he thought there was so much involved that he should do what he could for the Secretary’s sake. The <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss>. said he didn’t believe the statement would be such that it would interfere with <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>’s operation. If we don’t do something to keep it out of the Arab League it will sink anyway.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> said that to be perfectly honest with the Secretary he would prefer that the <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss>. not make the statement now but if in his judgment he thought he should it was OK with <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>, but he did think he would make the trip in any event.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said the reasons he wanted to make the statement were: If the Russians began to get into the scene, particularly in Egypt with various devices which they are now using at the present time and the situation becomes intensified, we would have to alter our entire position from one of neutrality in the area. The situation is rapidly changing and we should do something soon. It is more or less perhaps backing Egypt against Israel. There are risks involved.<note n="3" xml:id="d198fn3">On August 23, <persName>Dulles</persName> informed <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> that “I can now confirm my plan to make public statement on Israel-Arab problem in NY on Aug. 26”; that the Chargé in Amman was to make the text of the speech available to <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>; and that <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> was free to say that his water negotiations “stand on their own merits” and were separate from the goals to be outlined in <persName>Dulles</persName>’ speech.

                        <p>Since <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> position appears firmly based on point of principle which <persName>Burns</persName> has in effect endorsed in accepting <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> position on meetings, Embassy doubts that <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> will be willing abandon it on issue telephone communications in exchange Israeli acceptance <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> participation in meetings. Embassy recognizes procedure proposed by <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> is somewhat cumbersome but we have impression that its adoption would not significantly affect operation of local commanders agreement. Furthermore, it must be realized that this principle of avoiding direct contact underlies Egyptian position on a great number of points—including joint patrols—which arise in implementation <gloss target="#t_GAA1">GAA</gloss>.

                        <p>DEAR <persName>HAROLD</persName>: I have come to the conclusion that it is necessary to expedite the Alpha matter and to telescope somewhat the <pb xml:id="pg_367" n="367" facs="0395"/>preparatory plans. The situation has become so brittle that I fear that any day events may happen which will outdate the Alpha project. For example, while momentarily the situation in Egypt looks better, it could very readily become one where Soviet aid was enlisted by Egypt. In that event our own present program would go by the board and we might have to take a very different attitude, possibly by indicating an intention to back Israel more fully. I have come very definitely to the opinion that we must move rapidly if at all.</p>
                        <p>I have already told you that we are prepared to start in a small way to assist on the tank program for Iraq and I am confirming today our attitude of contemplated adherence to the Iraq–Turkey arrangements as I indicated to you in Paris.<note n="2" xml:id="d201fn2">An August 19 letter from <persName>Dulles</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> stated that while it was not feasible for the United States to join the Baghdad Pact “until there was a relaxation of tension between the Arab states and Israel”, it would at that time “be disposed to seek formal adherence.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>I expect to be in a position later today to cable you the text of the statement which I plan to make and which closely follows the present draft<note n="3" xml:id="d201fn3">It is not clear whether the reference is to the July 15 draft (Enclosure 2 to <ref target="#d169">Document 169</ref>) or to a subsequent draft; see <ref target="#d190fn6">footnotes 6</ref> and <ref target="#d190fn7">7, Document 190</ref>.</note> except that I plan to deal with the boundary subject only in terms of generalities, avoiding detail. This, I understand from <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger Makins</persName>, is your preference. I feel I must, however, retain “in all respects”<note n="4" xml:id="d201fn4">See <ref target="#d180">Document 180</ref>.</note> since shifting to the generality here indicated would otherwise leave the statement apparently weighted in favor of the Arabs.</p>
                        <p>I realize that this change of pace is going to make it harder for you and for us in the way of preparing the ground. However, I doubt very much if it is prudent to have any great length of time between the decision to go ahead and the actual pronouncement itself.</p>
                        <p>A postponement for a week would not be practical as I am leaving on vacation on August 31 and I have Shigemitsu<note n="5" xml:id="d201fn5">Mamoru Shigemitsu, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan.</note> here August 29–31.

                        <p>I would hope that we can coordinate our plans for the next few days without the necessity of <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> going to London as I need him <pb xml:id="pg_368" n="368" facs="0396"/>very badly here to help cope with our own final preparations.

                        <p>DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: I am sending you separately the “Alpha” statement which I propose to make with reference to the Near East.<note n="2" xml:id="d202fn2">The draft statement, headed “#2, 8/19/55,” was sent as an attachment to the letter. It differed most significantly from the July 15 draft (Enclosure 2 to <ref target="#d169">Document 169</ref>) in Section III, which reads as follows:<p>“If there is to be a guarantee of borders, it would be normal that there should be prior agreement upon what the borders are. That is the third major problem. The existing lines separating Israel from the Arab states were fixed by the Armistice Agreements of 1949. They were not designed to be permanent frontiers in every respect; in part at least, they reflected the status of the fighting at the moment.</p>
                                <p>“To draw permanent boundaries which could be guaranteed is primarily a task for those who represent the people who are in contact with each other and who have to live on one side or the other of the boundaries. The task is admittedly one of difficulty. There is no single and sure guide, for each of two conflicting claims may seem to have much merit. The difficulty is increased by the fact that even territory which is barren has acquired a sentimental significance. However, the overall advantages of the measures here outlined would seem to outweigh vastly the net disadvantages of the adjustments needed to convert armistice lines of danger into boundary lines of safety.”</p>
                            </note> This is along the lines we have previously discussed and is, I understand, concurred in by the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> which will plan to issue a public statement of concurrence immediately following my own statement.</p>
                        <p>The section about boundaries we have decided to generalize rather than to touch on concrete and extremely sensitive subjects such as the access of Egypt to Saudi Arabia and Jordan through Neguib, the road from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and so forth.</p>
                        <p>We plan, subject to British concurrence expected shortly, to make the statement in New York before the Council on Foreign Relations next Friday evening.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_369" n="369" facs="0397"/>
                        <p>We have accelerated somewhat the program for a number of reasons. The first is that momentarily at least Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> seems more friendly and more sympathetic to such a project, although his ambitions in relation to the Neguib are much exaggerated.</p>
                        <p>The second is that <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>’s project which I had given the right of way now has taken a bad turn because the Arab States have apparently decided not to deal with him directly but through the Arab League, and while <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> is still going out to push on his project, it now seems less likely that he can carry it through as an independent effort. He has withdrawn his prior plea to me not to announce this project until he had a further round of his own.</p>
                        <p>In the third place, while at the moment there is relative tranquillity, events could happen in terms of a Soviet-Arab rapprochement so that we would have to back Israel much more strongly and drop our role of impartiality.</p>
                        <p>If “Alpha” is to be done at all, it should be done while we can speak as the friend of both.</p>
                        <p>As you know, we anticipate that the initial reaction of both sides will be negative. The Arabs do not really want to have peace with Israel, and Israel does not want to consider any boundary adjustments. Rather it wants first of all a security treaty with the United States. I believe, however, that the presentation will come to command a serious hearing and that at least it represents a positive effort by the United States to deal with this question. We need to make such an effort before the situation gets involved in 1956 politics.</p>
                        <p>Both <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and Herb Brownell have looked over the statement and think it is tolerable from a political standpoint.</p>
                        <p>I expect to have it shown in advance to a few of the Congressional leaders, Republican and Democrat.</p>
                        <p>The text, which was originally worked out in London, has been cabled back to them so that they can take note of some minor changes which have been made.</p>
                        <p>I would appreciate knowing whether you authorize me to make the presentation, which, as you will note, contains the statement that “I speak in this matter with the authority of the President.”</p>
                        <p>I would appreciate as early a reply as is practical because we want to have the statement translated into both Yiddish and Arabic and in the hands of all our Near East posts before I speak.<note n="3" xml:id="d202fn3">The President called <persName>Dulles</persName> at 10:50 a.m. on Monday, August 22.

                        </head>
                        <p>DEAR FOSTER: Many thanks for your message about Alpha.<note n="2" xml:id="d203fn2">
                                <ref target="#d201">Document 201</ref>.</note> I am sorry that you do not see your way to giving more time for the preparatory work which we have agreed should be done. I am recalling our Ambassador at Bagdad from his leave and instructing him to return to his post forthwith. He will have to do his best to prevent an adverse reaction in Iraq to your statement.</p>
                        <p>We had hoped that a substantial offer of tanks would soften the blow. So the Prime Minister and I are disappointed that you can only promise ten, but we are glad to see that you regard this as a start. In the circumstances we shall be happy to provide the two to match your gift. I think that both our Ambassadors in Bagdad should now tell Nuri in confidence that we have agreed that the Iraqi forces should be equipped with British tanks and that we are providing twelve to begin with. If you agree, I will give appropriate instructions to Sir Michael Wright.</p>
                        <p>As regards the text of your statement<note n="3" xml:id="d203fn3">Presumably the August 19 draft cited in <ref target="#d202fn2">footnote 2</ref>, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>. No record that the text was cabled to London has been found in Department of State files; it was apparently provided to the British Embassy.</note> may I make some suggestions. I am glad that you have decided to avoid detail, and my proposal is that you should be even less specific. I am sure you will agree that we should not give the contestants an excuse for taking up an extreme position against some particular part of what you say and so make any subsequent confidential negotiations more difficult. With this in mind, I hope you will feel able to omit the phrase in the passage dealing with refugees which limits the compensation to land and buildings.<note n="4" xml:id="d203fn4">The relevant sentences in the August 19 draft read as follows:<p>“All of this requires money. In part it should come from Israel as compensation due for land and buildings taken from the refugees. However, it may be that Israel cannot, unaided, now make full compensation.”</p>
                            </note> I entirely agree with this limitation, but I fear <pb xml:id="pg_371" n="371" facs="0399"/>that to announce it now would invite attack on the grounds that it is an unjustifiably narrow interpretation of the basis on which compensation should be paid. I am sure it would pay to be less specific.</p>
                        <p>I am a little worried about what you propose to say on frontiers. I fully agree that you must avoid the appearance of weighting your words in favour of the Arabs, and with that in mind I can see why you wish to retain “in all respects” in the first paragraph.</p>
                        <p>But I fear that the first and last sentences of the second paragraph as it stands will give the Arabs the impression that you think a few minor adjustments to the frontier are all that will be necessary and that you are expecting them to enter into direct negotiations with the Israelis on that basis. The Prime Minister shares my apprehension. I also fear that this will drive them into open opposition and in particular spoil our chances with the Egyptians, who will think that you have ignored their desire for access across the Negev. I must therefore ask you to reconsider this paragraph. Could you not perhaps omit the first sentence and simply say at the end that in spite of the difficulties of conflicting claims and sentiment you believe that it is possible to find a way of reconciling the vital interests of all the parties, adding that the United States would be willing to help in the search for a solution if required.</p>

                        <p>Mr. David Muirhead of the British Embassy delivered to me about 4 p.m. today Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>’s reply<note n="2" xml:id="d205fn2">
                                <ref target="#d203">Document 203</ref>.</note> to the Secretary’s letter of yesterday to him.<note n="3" xml:id="d205fn3">
                                <ref target="#d201">Document 201</ref>.</note> I called the Secretary and he asked me to come to his home. The following points were discussed there.</p>
                        <p>With respect to <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>’s suggestion that the British and American Ambassadors in Baghdad inform Nuri in confidence that we have agreed that the Iraq forces should be equipped with British tanks and that we are providing 12 to begin, I told the Secretary that our communications to date had merely dealt with the specific 10 tanks and had not committed us to the broader proposition that “Iraq forces should be equipped with British tanks.” The Secretary said that he knew that the President’s thinking was along the line of approval of the proposition suggested by <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> and he told me that I should inform Mr. Muirhead that we concurred in the British Ambassador making such a statement to Nuri but that we felt that it would be better for our Ambassador not to make the statement at this time unless queried by Nuri, in which case he might confirm it.</p>
                        <p>I was also to inform Muirhead that the Secretary is agreeable to omitting the phrase “land and buildings”; that the Secretary feels that if that change is made the word “full” in the following sentence should be changed to “adequate.”<note n="4" xml:id="d205fn4">
                                <persName>Dulles</persName>, like <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>, was referring to his draft statement of August 19; see <ref target="#d203fn3">footnotes 3</ref> and <ref target="#d203fn4">4, Document 203</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>With respect to <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>’s suggestion for the omission of “the first sentence”, it is not clear to which sentence he is referring as the paragraphing, due to telegraphic transmission of the text used by <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>, may be different. The Secretary thought, however, that <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> might be referring to the sentence beginning “The existing lines separating Israel” and possibly the following sentence “They were not designed [etc.].”<note n="5" xml:id="d205fn5">Brackets in the source text.</note> If that is so, the Secretary is inclined to agree but feels that it may require a little further redrafting of the section. We will give to the British Embassy on Monday our suggestions in this respect. (It later developed that the <pb xml:id="pg_374" n="374" facs="0402"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> suggestion was different from this and I so informed the Secretary.)</p>
                        <p>The Secretary also asked me to request the British Embassy to convey to <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> his appreciation for the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> accommodation to the Secretary’s time schedule.<note n="6" xml:id="d205fn6">A memorandum of August 22 from <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> to <persName>Dulles</persName> states that on August 21 the British Embassy had given him a message from <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> replying to the oral message from <persName>Dulles</persName> which <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> had given to the Embassy the previous day. The message reads in part as follows:<p>“With regard to the date, I confirm that I agree to work to August 26th.</p>
                                <p>“With regard to the tanks, I will instruct H.M.

                        <p>The Secretary authorized me to tell the Council on Foreign Relations to send out the letters of invitation to the Friday afternoon meeting.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he would have no objection to his speech being carried by radio and thought that would probably be a good idea. <gloss target="#t_ONE1">One</gloss> of the local New York stations would probably be glad to carry it if the national hookup did not. The Secretary thought that in any event <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> should arrange to make a recording of it.</p>
                        <p>I told the Secretary that I thought that it was desirable that he inform Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> of his forthcoming speech now that it was definitely decided to go ahead with it. The Secretary said that he would put in a call for <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> right away.<note n="7" xml:id="d205fn7">The Secretary telephoned Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> at 11:23 a.m., August 22, and informed him that the speech would be given on August 26 and that it would “be about the Middle East.” (Eisenhower Library, Dulles Papers, General Telephone Conversations)</note> He also said that he was seeing <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon Johnson</persName> tomorrow (Sunday) and intended to say something to him about it.<note n="8" xml:id="d205fn8">
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> informed Senator <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> on August 21 of his impending statement. <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> in turn, according to <persName>Dulles</persName>’ memorandum of the conversation, “indicated that he thought it was appropriate for us to make our position clear.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> General Memoranda of Conversation)</note>

Your reports Soviet efforts in Egypt confirm need for early action. If we delay further we may miss present relatively favorable moment. US is now in position impartial friend both parties but with delay we could be obliged, by Soviet maneuvers or domestic developments, to take steps which would arouse resentment of Arab states. Also we have period of comparative quiet in Arab-Israel relations. With Israel under <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> calm may not last especially should Israel learn beforehand of my statement. I am encouraged further by your latest talks with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> particularly latter’s view US should seize initiative in 1955.</p>

                        <p>2. In above spirit you wish to tell him confidentially of my plan to make major Arab-Israel statement on Aug 26. US decision to take initiative largely influenced by Egyptian advice as expressed by <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> that such action desirable in 1955. Statement will be made as sincere friend both sides and offers great deal to Arabs. You confident Egypt will realize positive benefits from objectives set forth and will take lead among Arab states in working towards them. Statement will outline in broad strokes US views on need for accommodation (not asking formal peace) and matters requiring settlement including borders, refugees, and guarantee of boundaries. (You should not provide further details at this time.) You will be glad further to discuss matter afterwards. You hope <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> will ponder statement carefully to determine how best to capitalize on opportunity offered and that he will provide constructive leadership to other Arab states.</p>

It is our feeling that Turkey, by reason her history, influence and position can contribute to a détente in present impasse which impedes our common effort strengthen area but we would not wish her jeopardize her important role in area defense by any current action in Israel-Arab dispute.

Hope it not too late that you consider following 2 suggestions:</p>
                        <p>As regards presentation here, would be far more hopeful if we could be more specific as regards subject matter covered paragraph 5 <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 325. Appreciate my recommendation regarding assisting <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> in some manner on arms purchase is most difficult for Washington. Nevertheless believe subject of such importance as regards U.S.-Egyptian relations in general and possible cooperation on this particular problem that it extremely important <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> does not obtain impression new matter has been raised requiring prior cooperation on his part before purchase can be consummated.</p>
                        <p>I fear that as matter now stands he may obtain this impression as he would think decision in principle should have been possible for Washington in time that has elapsed since his request to me on August 14,<note n="4" xml:id="d210fn4">For <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName>’s report, see <ref target="#d193">Document 193</ref>.</note> which, you will recall, similar to request made by <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName> in conversation with you before his departure.<note n="5" xml:id="d210fn5">See <ref target="#d178">Document 178</ref>.</note> If at all possible suggest alteration of this paragraph to indicate that, while complying his request produces severe difficulties that will require few more days to overcome, decision in principle has been made that a way will be found to assist him in purchase of some U.S. equipment.</p>
                        <p>As regards revised text of statement (not yet received) have been encouraged by word from <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">George Allen</persName> that specific references to proposed settlement plan might be replaced by more general statements. Think this important in general but particularly so as regards Negev and that text not commit us to any specific formula or even type of solution. Egypt’s reaction to speech will most probably be largely influenced by phraseology regarding this problem and if catch phrase such as “re-establishment of continuity of Arab territory” can possibly be utilized we may not come out too badly. Realize this is extremely difficult without specifically endorsing Israel’s right of access to Elath but believe this issue can become matter of bargaining at later date if statement worded with this <pb xml:id="pg_382" n="382" facs="0410"/>objective in mind. Statement would have to be phrased in such a way that it would not evoke strong Egyptian denunciation which would have effect of freezing Arab position from outset.</p>
                        <p>While above recommendations seem very important here am certain you know we will do our best carry through with whatever decision you feel required from over-all viewpoint.</p>

                        <p>147. Eyes only for the Secretary. Re Middle East. I explained to Secretary-General Hammarskjold the purpose and general content of your speech Friday on the Middle East. He was unusually excited and pleased, in fact interrupted when I mentioned US plans regarding financial aid for compensation and repatriation of refugees, to remark “This is the best news you could bring me”.</p>
                        <p>He feels that the refugee question is the keystone in the Middle East area and that solution of it may well “break the dike” although he does not expect that political solution will be found in the immediate future.</p>
                        <p>He promised to give full support both publicly and in consultation with representatives of interested nations.</p>
                        <p>In a subsequent conversation at which I informed him regarding your speech Sir <persName corresp="#p_DSPJ1">Pierson Dixon</persName> (<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>) read me his instructions. In accordance with which he will see the Secretary General this afternoon expressing complete British agreement and requesting Hammarskjold’s support.</p>
                        <p>The absence of top Arab and Israeli representatives here makes contact in New York difficult and perhaps unwise. I suggest therefore that our approach be made at the capitals and if you wish with the Ambassadors at Washington.</p>

                        <p>138. For Chief of Mission. In your talks with officials of govt to which accredited, after Secretary’s speech Aug 26, you should bear in mind that primary objective speech is to provide impetus which could lead toward sincere negots for an Arab-Israel settlement in near future. It is our hope that leaders of area will agree with US view that efforts reach settlement by all concerned are urgently required. If however after thorough consideration Secretary’s statement they unwilling or unable consider possibility of working toward settlement, statement will remain as definitive exposition of US policy objectives toward area which this Govt wishes to achieve in few months if possible or longer if need be.</p>
                        <p>You should provide no details of US views as to possible elements of settlement unless and until specifically instructed do so. Fol telegram<note n="2" xml:id="d213fn2">Infra.</note> sets forth points which we have agreed with <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> should be made by US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> reps regarding Secretary’s and <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>’s statements.</p>
                        <p>After you have had opportunity appraise reaction to Secretary’s speech telegraph Dept your recommendations as to next steps this Govt should take to lead parties to sincere negots either direct or in Trieste pattern.</p>

                        <p>139. Dept has agreed with <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> on fol position to be taken by reps in Israel and Arab states in any background comment on Secretary’s speech Aug 26.<note n="2" xml:id="d214fn2">For text of <persName>Dulles</persName>’ address, see Department of State Bulletin, September 5, 1955, pp. 378–380.</note> You should not volunteer comment beyond urging earnest consideration and support of statement. But if pressed and you believe situation warrants you may informally use fol background:</p>
                        <p>1. It is important that statement not be regarded as a “plan” for a settlement. Rather it an explanation of what US would do to make a settlement possible.</p>
                        <p>2. Statement declares our policy re border guarantees. Israel Govt may object that it makes guarantee dependent on a settlement. Arab Govts may assert it attempts force them into settlement with Israel. We must insist there is no suggestion of coercion. Statement does not demand immediate decisions from Govts concerned in dispute but offers opportunity for discussion which we trust they will not throw away. Our real hope is it will provide impetus to instill in parties to dispute a sense of urgency in seeking a settlement; and that after a possible initial period of adverse statements it will lead them discuss possibility of a settlement with US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> who are in position help them in ways Secretary’s statement indicates.</p>
                        <p>3. If you are questioned on details of statement you may make use fol points:</p>
                        <p>a) <hi rend="italic">Refugees.</hi> There should be no dispute on principle of compensation. Israel has from time to time admitted her liability pay it as part of a general settlement. There is no doubt Israel could not pay the compensation which is due without help. The offers of US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to take part in a loan to Israel for this purpose are a most important contribution to a solution this difficult problem.</p>
                        <p>Re question repatriation we cannot be dogmatic. Secretary’s statement reserves right by which Arabs set so much store. It is reasonable expect Israel find homes for some of refugees who wish return; but it clearly not possible for all or most of them go back. Large numbers will have be resettled in Arab countries and Secretary announces backing of US for appropriate resettlement projects.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_386" n="386" facs="0414"/>
                        <p>b) <hi rend="italic">Guarantees.</hi> Importance this passage of statement as a definition of US policy is mentioned above. If Israel could now get an unconditional guarantee of her existing frontiers she would have less need seek a solution through a settlement with Arabs while Arabs would of course remain unreconciled to situation. But Arabs should not jump to conclusion they can afford reject a reasonable settlement in hopes blocking guarantee forever.</p>
                        <p>c) <hi rend="italic">Frontiers.</hi> This passage directly concerns Israel and Arab States. The problem of sovereignty over demilitarized zones between Israel and Syria should not prove serious. There is the notably unsatisfactory frontier between Israel and Jordan dividing villages from their lands and in some places cutting villages themselves in two. Finally there is the Arab claim for unbroken land connection between Egypt and rest of Arab world to East. These are the kinds of frontier problems that need to be tackled. We believe that with patience and good will, ways could be found reconcile vital interests all parties.</p>
                        <p>d) <hi rend="italic">Jerusalem.</hi> Here Secretary simply defining another problem that must be dealt with. There have been many proposals on status <gloss target="#t_Jlem1">Jlem</gloss> and it is for United Nations to review them. You may recall that in past US has supported proposals for changing original <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution on territorial internationalization and you may say you are sure US is not committed to any particular solution.</p>
                        <p>e) <hi rend="italic">Econ Questions.</hi> In any settlement, Arab blockade of Israel would have be brought to end. There have also been proposals that Jordan might be offered a free port and transit facilities in Israel. That is the kind of econ question that might be discussed. If pressed you may say that Secretary’s statement does not imply that Arabs would <hi rend="italic">necessarily</hi> have to engage in direct trade with Israel. But you should avoid this question if possible.</p>
                        <p>4. If you are asked whether you think there should be a conference of the parties you should point out it has always proved difficult get them sit down together. There may be other more fruitful ways of proceeding.</p>
                        <p>5. If you are asked about <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolutions you should say it well known that Arabs take their stand on <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution of 1947 as their opening bid and that Israelis claim their present frontiers. If settlement ever reached there will have be concessions from both these positions. We believe that in present circumstances neither is practicable. All agreements require concessions by both sides.</p>

                        <p>290. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> received me alone in residency at 11 a.m. this morning. I told him I approaching him upon matter which I considered of greatest importance to Egypt, Middle East, and in fact of worldwide significance. Stated Secretary had asked that I see him on this particular date and I appreciated promptness with which that request had been granted. Timing had been important to us as Secretary wished him to be among the very first who should know of his personal plans. Stated I considered matter so important I had reduced to writing Secretaries [<hi rend="italic">Secretary’s</hi>] instructions to me which I wished to read. I thereupon read to him substance of <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 325<note n="2" xml:id="d215fn2">
                                <ref target="#d207">Document 207</ref>.</note> with no change other than smoothing out cablese.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> listened intently. Department’s statement so full and well conceived I thought it best not to attempt expansion other than few remarks. Regarding portion which indicates others were being informed, I told him this not being done as fully as in his case in view of our conversations in past this subject and recognition of constructive role it was hoped Egypt could play. I expanded somewhat upon vital importance initial press reactions and stressed that whole world would be watching to compare the reaction of Arab States with that of Israel. He had risen in stature in world in view of his stand for peace. He was now in key position to cooperate on removing one of world’s greatest danger spots and contribute to developments of great historical significance. Added that I personally was extremely pleased my government had felt able to take initiative upon this problem in this specific manner. I was convinced that after study he would conclude that Secretary’s speech would make major contribution towards giving real impetus to developments which I knew both he and we desired.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> asked if he could have paper which I read as it was of great importance and he wished to study its contents. I agreed instead to let Ali Sabri take full notes upon its contents. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> said he could not give me preliminary reaction as everything depended upon what Secretary would actually say. He would study matter very carefully and hoped statement would be of nature which would allow him to feel he could cooperate. At no time in conversation <pb xml:id="pg_388" n="388" facs="0416"/>that followed did <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> indicate any displeasure or fact that he felt this method of handling was a mistake.</p>
                        <p>I saw <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> at 1230 and found him more forthcoming. <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> stated he appreciated friendly approach in giving Egypt advance warning and general tone of understanding and friendliness that permeated my whole communication. He was glad to see that time table he and I had discussed months ago was being urgently sought by us. Said he and I had agreed 1955 better than 1956. <persName>Dulles</persName> had gone further and said also better than 1957. Yet time had gone by and he had become fearful we would not press in time. Stated he shared my hopes and sincere desire that statement would be given fair chance in area. Wished me to understand however that a public statement led to public questions which demanded public answers. He would wait with crossed fingers and sincere prayer that no unauthorized statement would be made in one Arab capital or another which would burn bridges—not with that motive—but to appear patriotic. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> and he would do their best to see common sense and fair play maintained. All this however depended upon nature of statement. If by terms it automatically ruled out some of the Arabs’ strongly held convictions, as for instance on boundaries, then he could promise me nothing. If it did not take such a stand then he would do his utmost.</p>
                        <p>Other matters which emerged in both discussions will be reported separately. Am off to see <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName> who ill, but who should be brought into picture.</p>
                        <p>This an interesting day and so far, would say, so good. Without knowledge of text it difficult to see how reaction either <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s or <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName>’s could have been better.</p>

                            </note>) and as text of draft is excellent, believe it most important we seek to capitalize apparent objectivity both <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> by making sure that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> receives full text at least prior to its receipt in Egypt from wire services. Must proceed on hope that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> will desire to control initial press reaction and difficult to see how he can do so unless he has time to study text prior to its receipt in hands of local press.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> this morning I would see he got full text as soon as possible, but warned him that past experience indicated that advance texts sent me in code sometimes did not arrive until after wire services able to transmit clear text. He therefore does not know whether he will be able to see text prior to local press. I feel sure that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> would respect confidence in advance delivery. Furthermore timing suggested below would make impossible press treatment here prior to Saturday morning by which time local press will have picked up at least portions of speech in any event.</p>
                        <p>Therefore request authorization pass text to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> on confidential basis approximately 5 p.m. Cairo time (11 a.m. Washington time) August 26, or earlier if you think it safe to do so (suggested timing must of course be advanced if Department plans to issue earlier on wire services on “hold for publication” basis).<note n="3" xml:id="d216fn3">The Department instructed <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LEB1">Lawson</persName> on August 25 to furnish <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> with advance copies of the text.

                        <p>292. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> took occasion my call on him today (on other subject) to inform me that he had yesterday communicated his decision to Secretary General of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> that <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> had decided to terminate talks on <persName>Burns</persName>’ proposals. He stated the Israelis had obviously provoked incident Gaza August 22<note n="2" xml:id="d217fn2">On August 22, Israeli and Egyptian troops engaged in armed conflict near the U.N. truce hut at Kilo 95 in the Gaza Strip. One Egyptian officer and two Egyptian soldiers died in this action. Documentation on this incident is <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> 674.84A.</note> with objective of applying pressure to obtain for domestic political purposes their goal of establishing direct contact, outside <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> auspices, between parties. He stated Israel must finally come to learn that these tactics would not work and that he was not going to agree to any position that did in fact, or even gave appearance, of shoving <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> aside. I stated my regret that he had felt such step necessary, and that, while I understood principle he trying to maintain, doubted that world opinion position would be good. Did not carry matter further as purpose of call had been discuss other matters of overriding importance reported separately.</p>
                        <p>In discussing with Embassy <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> decision terminate talks, General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> added that after <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> informed him of this decision they discussed progress of talks to date and that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> expressed disappointment that there had not been greater attention given three points covering joint patrols, obstacles and neutral zone. While <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> would not meet with Israeli it would be glad study proposal <persName>Burns</persName> might wish submit coordinating these points. <persName>Burns</persName> said that he agreed submit his views and that in effort place latest incident in proper perspective he pointed out that Israelis had broken off discussions on two earlier occasions.</p>
                        <p>As Gohar did not mention breakdown of discussions in his conversation with Embassy representatives or <persName>Burns</persName> yesterday forenoon, it appears <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> decision may not have been taken until after <persName>Burns</persName> talk with Kheirat Said (Deputy Foreign Minister) which, according <persName>Burns</persName>, made no progress whatsoever.</p>
                        <p>Having heard both Gohar’s and <persName>Burns</persName>’ views reference progress Gaza talks, Embassy confirmed in its views set forth Embassy telegram 256.<note n="3" xml:id="d217fn3">
                                <ref target="#d199">Document 199</ref>.</note> I realize we all shared the hope that these discussions would see a bilateral connection developed between Israel and Egypt <pb xml:id="pg_391" n="391" facs="0419"/>but we should not lose sight of fact that even more important would be gradual development of an area of cooperation between the two and that at this stage best chance of achieving this would be to permit Egyptians to feel they can cooperate without sacrificing principle of no direct contact.</p>
                        <p>In light of the forthcoming developments having a more important bearing on basic issue, I do not recommend any action on matters set forth this telegram at this time. Suggest however that Department bear in mind desirability approaching Secretary General <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> along lines preceding paragraph at appropriate time.</p>

                                <ref target="#d206">Document 206</ref>.</note>) of Secretary’s statement. He received news with evidence some concern saying he was “deeply apprehensive” and repeating some of his previous attitudes (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 118<note n="4" xml:id="d218fn4">On August 16, <persName corresp="#p_LEB1">Lawson</persName> reported <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>’s opinion “that the whole purpose of an approach to the settlement of the basic Israel-Arab problem would be defeated if an announced proposal by the US implied that a security guarantee for Israel was contingent upon the settlement of certain outstanding problems by means of concessions by Israel. This, he felt sure, would further solidify Arab determination not to settle those exact problems unless the concessions they demanded were forthcoming, thus prolonging the present unsettled security situation.” (Telegram 118 from Tel Aviv, August 16; Department of State, Central Files, 684A.86/8–1655)</note>). He seemed particularly concerned over public reaction to any presumption that settlement of Arab-Israel tensions would be dependent on concessions to be made by Israel. He said, if statement contains suggestion of concessions which Israel unable to offer, then purely negative results may be expected; it will cast a shadow over US–Israel relations and peace will be retarded. He said he appreciated this advance advice of statement but statement along lines he fears can only be inimical to US–Israel relations and to prospect of peace with Arabs.</p>

                        <p>He returned to his previous argument that any concessions demanded would be made at expense of Israel which in wholly defensive position and making no demand of “concessions” from Arabs.</p>
                        <p>He remarked that now all of political parties and others (meaning those within his own party) who opposed his moderation policy and hopes for US security assurance would be saying, “We told you so”, and reaction of opponents to his policy might be expected to be immediate and strong.</p>
                        <p>It should be noted that his comments were predicated on assumption that statement would suggest concessions Israel unable to make.</p>
                        <p>He added that statement would not create a favorable public attitude toward the <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Urged that he not prejudge statement or effect; that although had not received text it might well be that his apprehensions were ill-founded and statement might accomplish just what Israel had always desired, that is, bringing together of two interested parties for discussion of outstanding problems, whereby benefiting them and entire area. He expressed appreciation my good will and optimism but felt that news I had brought left him in “a state of gloom.”</p>
                        <p>British Ambassador who saw him immediately after our conversation received almost exact reaction from Prime Minister and is so reporting to London.</p>
                        <p>I agreed to supply text of statement to Prime Minister morning August 27 and to have accurate full text in hands of press in time for first issue following Secretary’s speech. This will be morning August 28 as no newspapers Saturday, but radio will operate Saturday. We will report promptly press and radio reaction.</p>

(Memorandum of Telephone Conversation, by <persName corresp="#p_BPD1">Bernau</persName>; Eisenhower Library, Dulles Papers, General Telephone Conversations)</note> After concerting with British Chargé, I telephoned Margerie late yesterday afternoon we now had text and could give it to him then or this morning. He chose latter. When text given him this noon, his only substantive comment was that sentence in Part II concerning U.S. willingness to join in guarantees was obviously key point of statement. Believe French sensibilities adequately covered.</p>
                        <p>He says he sent word to <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> orally by member of latter’s Cabinet who has gone to Aix that statement would be forthcoming and that he does not plan to transmit text to <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> since latter fully occupied with Moroccan discussions. Margerie will however have Foreign Office press chief guide French press favorably when Secretary makes statement. He thought that sufficient but at my request agreed to suggest <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> issue supporting statement after his return to Paris sometime this weekend.</p>
                        <p>I now believe it would be desirable for British Chargé to show Margerie Macmillan’s proposed statement tomorrow afternoon or Saturday. Reilly agrees and is so recommending to London.<note n="3" xml:id="d220fn3">Achilles reported on August 26 that the British Chargé, Reilly, had shown <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>’s statement to Margerie, “who had already drafted guidance for Quai D’Orsay to give press,” and “was inclined to think … that there would be little point in <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> making additional statement on Monday [August 29].” (Telegram 889 from Paris; Department of State, Central Files, 684A.86/8–2655)</note>

                        <p>DEAR MR. SECRETARY: In answer to your request to the Director of Central Intelligence,<note n="2" xml:id="d221fn2">No record of such a request has been found in Department of State files.</note> we are submitting the following views and the attached analysis.<note n="3" xml:id="d221fn3">Not printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>On 23 May, … Soviet Ambassador Daniel Solod in Cairo offered technical and economic assistance to Egypt, including financing of the proposed Aswan high dam. …</p>
                        <p>In late July, <persName corresp="#p_SDT1">D.T. Shepilov</persName>, editor of Pravda, and a secretary of the Communist Party, visited Egypt and … elaborated the Soviet offer….</p>
                        <p>As reported to you by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName>, Ahmad Husain, Egypt’s former ambassador in Washington, in discussing the alleged <persName corresp="#p_SDT1">Shepilov</persName> offer, told <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> in Cairo that it included a cotton barter deal to finance the high dam, 100 MIG’s and 200 tanks. Jet bombers (probably IL–28’s) were also said to be available for 37,000 Egyptian pounds (equivalent to $106,000). Soviet spokesmen reportedly also suggested in discussions with Egyptians that if direct negotiations with Moscow embarrassed Cairo, Warsaw or Prague could offer the same deal.</p>
                        <p>A report that Radio Moscow had broadcast in Arabic to the Near East an offer of free military assistance to Egypt appears to be in error.<note n="4" xml:id="d221fn4">See <ref target="#d194fn5">footnote 5, Document 194</ref>.</note> The latest Egyptian claims are that Radio Israel made the statement on 10 August, that this statement was picked up by an Egyptian monitoring station, and, as a result of haste and carelessness, was passed to the press as having been broadcast by the Soviets in Arabic, and with the paragraph concerning military aid deleted. These reports and similar ones all apparently originate with Egyptians. They may be exaggerated in order to bring pressure on the United States to satisfy Egypt’s military needs on favorable terms. The fact that no Western monitors intercepted any such broadcast, coupled with the lack of motivation for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to broach an offer of such magnitude and portent in this manner, raises the possibility of deception, which we are still trying to confirm.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_396" n="396" facs="0424"/>
                        <p>During the past weeks, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> … has offered Saudi Arabia economic aid and military equipment.<note n="5" xml:id="d221fn5">For documentation regarding Soviet offers of economic and military assistance to Saudi Arabia, see volume XIII.</note> This approach was made by Soviet Ambassador Lavrentiev in Tehran, first to the Saudi ambassador<note n="6" xml:id="d221fn6">Sayid Hamza Ghuth.</note> and then to King <persName corresp="#p_SAA1">Saud</persName>, and Deputy Foreign Minister Yassin. In the spring of 1955, Soviet offers of military, economic, and diplomatic aid were also reported made to Syria.</p>
                        <p>In our opinion the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> directly or through its Satellites is able to deliver the items specifically mentioned by the Egyptians; heavy artillery, tanks, jet fighter and bomber aircraft and destroyers, in the quantities that could conceivably be absorbed by Egypt or other nations in the Arab league without any perceptible effect on its own arms program. Only in the event the Soviets anticipated general war in the relatively near future would they have any compelling reason to hang onto all of their vast stockpile of this obsolescent matériel. For example, the early alternate fate of the MIG–15’s is probably to be turned into scrap.</p>
                        <p>Moreover the Soviets are undoubtedly well aware of the … preoccupation of Arab leaders such as <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasr</persName> and King <persName corresp="#p_SAA1">Saud</persName> with building their arms strength and would calculate that the surest way to achieve a real position of influence in those countries would be to become a substantial supplier of arms with the attendant requirements for Soviet technical and possibly tactical training in their use.</p>
                        <p>It is also quite consistent with what we know of current Soviet external trade programs for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to be willing to offer such equipment for indigenous currency or basic commodities with favorable terms as to time of repayment.</p>
                        <p>Finally, it seems to us that the present Soviet drive to relax tensions between the power centers of East and West could well have as a concomitant a subordinate policy of sowing seeds of discord in such trouble spots as the Near East.</p>
                        <p>We, therefore, conclude that it is well within Soviet capability to implement the reported offers of arms aid and that it is probably their intention to do so if the offeree governments accept their proposals.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MW1">Morris</persName> called me around 3 a.m. this morning and said he had a message from Cairo that he thought I would wish to see at once. I met him shortly at the Department. He showed me a telegram which the British Embassy had just received from Cairo,<note n="2" xml:id="d222fn2">No copy of this telegram has been found in Department of State files.</note> the substance of which was that there were reports that the Egyptian army command were considering launching a series of attacks on the Sinai front today.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MW1">Morris</persName> and I agreed that because of the nature of the reports it would be better for any communication from the Department to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> to be sent through the British Embassy in Cairo. Accordingly, after discussing the matter with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> on the telephone, I asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MW1">Morris</persName> if he would send the message to <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName>
                            <note n="3" xml:id="d222fn3">No copy of this message has been found in Department of State files.</note> which is referred to in the attached letter.<note n="4" xml:id="d222fn4">(Attached to copy circulating <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">G[eorge] V.

                        <p>This afternoon Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MW1">Morris</persName> called again. He had a telegram from London<note n="2" target="d222fn2">No copy of this telegram has been found in Department of State files.</note> which expressed doubt that the Egyptian Government would launch attacks in view of their advance information about the Secretary’s statement but leaving it to the discretion of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Ambassador, in consultation with <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName>, whether an approach should be made or not.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MW1">Morris</persName> also had a telegram from Cairo<note n="2" target="d222fn2">No copy of this telegram has been found in Department of State files.</note> which said that <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName>, having failed to see <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>, spoke to <persName corresp="#p_AGAH1">Abdel Hakim Amer</persName>, Minister of Defense and Chief of Armed Forces. <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> said that Washington had informed him there were rumors there that hostilities had broken out or were about to break out. <persName corresp="#p_AGAH1">Hakim Amer</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> that all was quiet but that he would make a check to be certain. The telegram concludes by saying that unless <persName corresp="#p_AGAH1">Amer</persName> is prevaricating—which would be quite out of character—it looks as though plans for attack have been called off.</p>

                        <p>Last night we came very close to having real trouble here. By late afternoon I had come to believe it possibly true that orders had in fact been issued for heavy attack on some 6 or 8 separate Israeli objectives along borders, although <persName corresp="#p_AGAH1">Hakim Amer</persName> assured me border was quiet (which of course it was at the time of our conversation). Matter delicate to handle as one of greatest past difficulties of this embassy has been suspicion that we are attempting to penetrate Army. Had to weigh possibilities being able to stop attack if it had in fact been ordered against long range harm that could accure [<hi rend="italic">accrue</hi>] to us by appearing to have such information. Decided however about midnight, knowing that all appointments <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> members had been cancelled and they had been in continuous session since early afternoon, that the chance should be taken. Besides the obvious danger, to be prevented at all times if at all possible, such action by Egypt would have been particularly disastrous in connection timing and receipt of Secretary’s speech. Unable reach <persName corresp="#p_AGAH1">Hakim Amer</persName> and there was long delay after which it obvious Zakaria Mohiud Din had been picked to return my call. I told him I had received an additional excited cable from Washington.<note n="2" xml:id="d223fn2">No copies of these telegrams have been found in Department of State files.</note> Still not clear but it obvious Washington extremely concerned re possibility developments along border. Told him I had no clue as to Washington sources of concern but that … there might be real effort made to draw Egypt into a trap prior to delivery of speech. Told him I knew enough of contents of speech to know that it an extremely good development for Arab side and what a great pity it would be if Egypt would be drawn into action which might either cancel speech or cause radical change in text. Zakaria said he understood the point and appreciated the concern. <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> meeting lasted until daybreak and we have reliable info orders given cancelling operation. There some chance these orders not reaching certain small units which could yet result in some action but probably most limited. Will probably never know part my action with <persName corresp="#p_AGAH1">Hakim Amer</persName> and Zakaria had in cancellation of orders. Regret necessity of tactics used but could see no other <pb xml:id="pg_399" n="399" facs="0427"/>way that we could afford here at moment and would guess the peg of <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss>’s speech did give us opportunity to be effective. This near action by Egyptians undoubtedly came as result of <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s public commitment to avenge further deaths at hands of Israeli so my guess is there was lively time in <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> discussions last evening and hope some day we able find out stand taken by various members.</p>

                        <p>165. In view of crucial struggle between <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> going on within <gloss target="#t_Mapai1">Mapai</gloss> Party (Embassy telegram 142<note n="2" xml:id="d224fn2">Not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 784A.00/8–2355) The <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> Cabinet had resigned on August 15, just before the newly-elected Knesset convened. President Itzhak Ben Zvi invited <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> to form a new government, and on August 17, the Knesset adjourned for 2 months to facilitate his efforts. In the interim, the <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> Cabinet was serving in a caretaker capacity.</note>), it now appears that tripartite formula for dealing with Foreign Minister (Department telegram 87<note n="3" xml:id="d224fn3">
                                <ref target="#d186">Document 186</ref>.</note>) might prove unfavorable to very ends for which we strive.</p>
                        <p>The reason given by the French and British Governments for the formula, that is, the West should not give <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> what is denied <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> may be entirely fallacious. As I visualize the possible formation of the new government <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> would have great difficulty in justifying his conduct of business with Ambassadors in Tel Aviv, particularly if there is no reciprocity. This would tend to concentrate in <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>’s hands all important foreign policy matters, leaving <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> to explain as best he can through the press and through his missions abroad the military and other actions taken by Israel. This seems clearly indicative of <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>’s basically weak and extremely difficult position if he should accept portfolio of Foreign Minister. Furthermore, recent history has clearly demonstrated that his basic attitudes are much more conducive to making progress on area matters than are the impetuous decisions of <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>….</p>

                        <p>The British Ambassador remarked to me last night that he was very disturbed about this proposed tripartite formula and had encountered the same reaction from smaller missions as have we; namely, that formula will prevent them from effectively performing their duties, although there was willingness on their part to try to follow the formula. I understand that he has so informed his government.</p>

Parenthetically, it should be noted that this statement is in complete accord with tenor of remarks <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> has made to me recently whenever Gaza Strip <pb xml:id="pg_401" n="401" facs="0429"/>problem has been discussed. Two days ago he expressed with some agitation his surprise over Egyptian forces attack on <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> Patrol (Embassy telegram 135<note n="7" xml:id="d225fn7">Not printed. (Department of State, Central Files, 674.84A/8–2255) See <ref target="#d217fn2">footnote 2, Document 217</ref>.</note>) and he stated emphatically, “<persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> feels he can make all sorts of trouble on the Gaza border and can get away with it by counting on strong US pressures on Israel”. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> made no reply to my comment that if <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> has so much confidence in US pressures exerted on <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, it seemed unlikely that he would refer so frequently to his fear of <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> action in Gaza. However, there was no question in my mind but that he wished to underscore his opinion that US warnings to Israel were operating as an effective screen behind which Egypt’s activities were undertaken.</p>
                        <p>Although <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>’s message to me, coupled with his previous comments to me, may constitute a warning to Egypt, they may also be designed to establish a rationale for a more militant policy towards Egypt based on a governmental decision already made.</p>
                        <p>It has been my consistent view that there are two essential elements required prior to any drastic retaliation by <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. These are:</p>
                        <p>(1) Fatalities incurred as a result of border activity, and</p>
                        <p>(2) Belief by <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> of clear Egyptian Government participation in border incidents.</p>
                        <p>We have no evidence that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> will respond immediately to latest Egyptian incursions but it is apparent that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> will regard their continuation as evidence bad <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> intentions border situation and will respond by more militant measures. Nor have we evidence of military activity which points to retaliatory measures of unusual character.</p>

Delivered Secretary’s speech to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> 6 p.m., today.<note n="2" xml:id="d226fn2">August 26.</note> His reaction somewhat less satisfactory than had hoped. Had feeling he somewhat confused by general nature of approach and really did not understand significance of some passages. He asked many questions and Department telegram 347<note n="3" xml:id="d226fn3">Printed as <ref target="#d214">Document 214</ref>.</note> used to considerable advantage. His principal points of concern seemed to be refugees and territorial. He said Arabs would find it difficult to accept concept that refugees should be scattered with settlement in many separate places. There was considerable discussion about Negev with repeated references his part to <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>’s plans for settling 2 million additional Jews by developing Negev. I told him this impossible because of water situation. Even if Israelis had all of Jordan waters this not feasible and if Arabs could only see advantage of agreement for present plans for use of Jordan waters then certainly not even a small fraction of waters needed for such plans for Negev would be available.</p>
                        <p>I reiterated again my hope that caution would be used as regards press comment and my fear that editors might tend commit Egypt prior to real analysis of significance of speech. Pointed out that within realm of what is possible and feasible statement did not deny in any way what Arabs feel entitled to but that statement did in fact refuse Israel’s present primary aim, i.e., to obtain a permanent security guarantee of her present borders. He stated he felt there bound to be considerable criticism of statement but he would consider carefully what he could do.</p>

                        <p>Greatly surprised when he suddenly said he wished discuss Morocco. Told me that Nuri of Iraq had taken initiative to call upon Arab States to attack France. He himself was going to respond that Moroccan troubles were not solely fault of France but entire Atlantic Alliance and that he would be critical of US, particularly re military equipment being used against North Africans. I told him of US efforts on this problem and fact that we now hope, that partly because of these efforts, situation might greatly improve. Reminded him that US can often not get credit for efforts they making, as to be effective our pressures must be accomplished secretly, just as had been the case of the British during his own Suez controversy. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> said he appreciates these things but frankly he was not prepared see Nuri Said become Arab champion on such issues. He asked if he had my permission to tell press that he had complained to me re Moroccan situation. I said certainly. Am reporting this extraneous matter as it may have bearing upon his decision re press treatment of speech.</p>
                        <p>In view of feeling that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> really did not understand significance of speech and other matter reported above decided take copy to <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> immediately thereafter and had <persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName> deliver copy to <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Ahmed Hussein</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName>, while not so admitting, obviously pleased with speech. He warned, however, that we must expect criticism, and that it was our job as professionals to try to keep this from affecting our thinking. He said no matter what happens we must continue to work together just as before.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName> found <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName> slightly disappointed that speech not more specific. He feared <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would take opportunity make specific promises support Arab position and expressed concern Communist penetration Egyptian press. He took initiative, however, to phone Mustapha Amin of <hi rend="italic">Akhbar</hi> to urge withholding any comment in Saturday edition. He was informed <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had already decided all papers should withhold comment at least until Sunday to await Israel reaction. Consider this decision defer press comment quite good development if it is maintained; it suggests <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> not quite so pessimistic as he appeared. There no doubt, however, that he fears his own position would suffer if Egypt’s reaction were to appear soft in comparison that other Arab States, particularly in light current difficulties along border with Israel.</p>

He responded by saying that he certainly had been wondering how I knew so much about plans his military. Replied I knew nothing of his Army’s plans and gave him same explanation cause my concern re two unclear messages from Washington<note n="2" xml:id="d227fn2">No copies of these telegrams have been found in Department of State files.</note> …. He seemed accept this explanation and said I then had been unaware of how much cause I really had for concern. Told me as result of 22 Aug incident<note n="3" xml:id="d227fn3">See <ref target="#d217fn2">footnote 2, Document 217</ref>.</note> orders had been sent to frontier forces carry out simultaneous and large scale attacks upon “several” Israeli objectives. As result of my call to <persName corresp="#p_AGAH1">Hakim Amer</persName> they had finally decided issue stop order to troops. This order had obviously not reached outlying units in time prevent some action but I might as well know that action would have been far heavier but for my call. At start of our conversation he unaware of action reported Para 3 Tel Aviv 161 to Dept.<note n="4" xml:id="d227fn4">See <ref target="#d225fn3">footnote 3, Document 225</ref>.</note> but received call in my presence with this info. I tried convince him that this had been unwise move …. Told him my Govt stood firmly behind policy of no retaliation and if I had in fact prevented heavy casualties he would some day thank me for what I had done. However this has been emotional day with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> himself attending funeral of officer killed Aug 22, and I doubt that I convinced him their action had been wrong. Furthermore if Israelis retaliate under this provocation see little hope of restraining forces here.</p>

                        <p>171. I saw Prime Minister Nuri at his home this morning shortly before his departure for a regular cabinet meeting and gave him a copy of the Secretary’s August 26 New York speech. Nuri had earlier heard a broadcast giving the highlights. He did not read the speech while I was with him. He said he wanted to read it more leisurely later at his office.</p>
                        <p>I told Nuri that after he had had time to study the statement carefully I hoped he would not only agree with our view of the urgency of trying to reach a settlement of the Arab-Israel problem but that he would also find it possible to give the statement his support.</p>
                        <p>Nuri’s first response was in the nature of a fine tribute to the Secretary. Without specifically mentioning last evening’s statement he said he admired very much the Secretary’s approach to world problems.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the statement Nuri Said that judging from what he had heard over the radio it covered well the outstanding Arab-Israel problems. Among these the problem of the frontiers was especially important. The position of the Arab states on this was well-known. It was based on the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution of 1947.</p>
                        <p>At this point I interjected that Israel’s position had also been made known. Israel stood pat on the present lines. The problem called for concessions from both sides. Nuri Said nothing to this but nodded.</p>
                        <p>Before leaving the problem of frontiers Nuri observed that he was very much interested in the passage of the Secretary’s statement dealing with the President’s authorization with a possible security guarantee.</p>
                        <p>The reaction of Egypt to the Secretary’s statement Nuri then said was of immediate interest to him. The reaction of each of the states bordering on Israel was important but above all this applied to Egypt. He would instruct the Iraqi Ambassador in Cairo to get <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s reaction. He only hoped the Ambassador would be able to get <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s honest reactions.</p>
                        <p>“I don’t think Israel will like the statement” Nuri Said.</p>
                        <p>We broke off our talk at this point as Nuri had to leave for his cabinet meeting. We agreed to talk further within the next few days.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.)</note> of the phrase:</p>
                        <p>“and believe that the principles outlined are those which must govern any attempt to solve the Palestine question by agreement.”<note n="3" xml:id="d230fn3">The phrase appears in the July 15 draft British statement cited in <ref target="#d169fn3">footnote 3, Document 169</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Our Secretary of State has telegraphed a reply in the following terms:</p>
                        <p>“Please inform Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> that we decided to omit the phrase to which he refers because, in view of the final form which Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>’ statement took, these words did not seem altogether appropriate. The ideas set forth in it were of so general a character, and the whole exercise had taken so much less detailed a form, that it seemed to us better to make certain amendments to the text which was shown to Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> in Paris. This was one of them. You will probably observe that there were one or two other changes which followed from the same thought.</p>
                        <p>“I regret that it is too late for us now to alter the statement which has gone out to all our posts abroad, but we shall cover the point in our guidance to the press.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_408" n="408" facs="0436"/>
                        <p>“Please also thank Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> for his kind message to me of August 25 which I received through Her Majesty’s Ambassador in Washington.<note n="4" xml:id="d230fn4">See <ref target="#d219">Document 219</ref>.</note> We have done our best to conform to the various changes which the plan has necessarily had to undergo, and we shall certainly keep in every sense the spirit of our collaboration. It seems to us that it has made a very good start, and the new difficulties on the Israel-Egypt border may in fact serve to bring home to all moderate, sensible people the need for some settlement.”</p>
                        <p>3. I understand from our Delegation that Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> has left New York and we should therefore be most grateful if you could arrange for this message to be passed to Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>.<note n="5" xml:id="d230fn5">

                        <p>82. 1. I called by appointment on Prime Minister–Foreign Minister Prince <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Faisal</persName> afternoon August 25 and, after advising him of Secretary’s proposed statement, handed him aide-mémoire reading:</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> expects make statement on some of issues pending between Israel and Arab States and possibility steps toward area stability and economic progress.</p>
                        <p>As statement will embody considered views <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> after intensive study, Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> hopes <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> will give it closest study and constructive consideration.</p>
                        <p>I was able make point we hoped statement would open door for helpful exchange of views, stress word “constructive”, arrange supply him English and Arabic texts, when received, and offer personally discuss them with him his convenience.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Faisal</persName> commented he would be last to question Secretary’s high motives in opening question but we should know his basic view: “It <pb xml:id="pg_409" n="409" facs="0437"/>is impossible for Jews and Arabs to live side by side as neighbors, that is as Jewish State among Arab States. Arab world had always accepted them as individuals; and, had they established state elsewhere, Arabs would have been among first to recognize it; but Arabs can never forget or accept injustice of establishment Jewish state in their land.”</p>
                        <p>2. British Chargé d’Affaires Phillips, in compliance his instructions, called later same day on Royal Counselor for Foreign Affairs Gargoni. Latter’s only substantive comment was to effect that American and British statements would be welcomed were they to open way for Jews departure and Arabs return to Palestine.</p>
                        <p>3. We have no local comment to report as yet. It may be of interest, however, to report <gloss target="#t_ARAMCO1">Aramco</gloss> Vice President for Government Relations Ohliger as saying when discussing <gloss target="#t_SOCONY1">SOCONY</gloss> case with me (my telegram 79, August 26<note n="2" xml:id="d231fn2">Not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 886A.2553/8–2655)</note>) that he feared Arabs would never recognize Israel and would continue tighten boycott. This was, he said, King <persName corresp="#p_SAA1">Saud</persName>’s policy based on deep religious conviction and not on advice given him by Royal Counselors Yasin and Gargoni. Ohliger’s relations with King are certainly more intimate and extend over longer period of years than any other American.</p>

                        <p>93. Initial reaction <persName>Dulles</persName> speech cautious, with requests more details and warning it needs careful study. No violence yet and none expected.</p>
                        <p>1. King told Embassy officer August 27 speech step in right direction. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> seeing King again today.</p>
                        <p>2. Prime Minister Mufti as reported by Ambassador Rifai to <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> initially reacts with uncertainty and disappointment. Prime <pb xml:id="pg_410" n="410" facs="0438"/>Minister stayed up all Friday night to hear speech, called Rifai at nine next morning and told him <gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> would have to reject <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> proposals which now tied to political settlement. To press Prime Minister has said only that <gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> will consult other Arab governments in keeping with its policy statement.</p>
                        <p>3. Four ministers on committee negotiating with <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> party were guarded in their reactions and gave impression they considered fate unkind in loading so much controversy on people who only wished to stay in office. Saman Daoud Minister Reconstruction pronounced speech step in right direction.

                        <p>181. Met with Prime Minister 4 p.m. today at his office Jerusalem (Embassy telegram 176<note n="2" xml:id="d234fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_LEB1">Lawson</persName> reported in telegram 176 from Tel Aviv, August 28, that he was trying to arrange an appointment with <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> and that he would emphasize the points in paragraph 2 of <ref target="#d220">Document 220</ref>. (Department of State, Central Files, 674.84A/8–2855)</note>). Following few exchange of remarks on Gaza developments, Secretary’s speech, and Syrian removal Israel soldiers from POW status,<note n="3" xml:id="d234fn3">Documentation regarding the issue of Israeli soldiers held captive in Syria is <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> 683.84A and 784A.551.</note> I delivered substance of message contained in paragraph 2 Department telegram 155.<note n="4" xml:id="d234fn4">
                                <ref target="#d229">Document 229</ref>.</note> Prime Minister listened carefully, made a few notes and when I finished entered at once into a measured reply, the gist of which follows:</p>
                        <p>1. Reviewed Gaza border developments of past few months which he characterized as complete quiet until recently when (a) Egypt suddenly opened fire on <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> patrol in Israel territory; (b) Egypt broke off Gaza talks under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>; (c) Egypt started series of “dastardly actions on border.”</p>
                        <p>He referred specifically to Egyptian military action of Thursday night<note n="5" xml:id="d234fn5">August 25.</note> when <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> military forces crossed into Israel territory four times and <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> publicly admitted actions, and Saturday night<note n="6" xml:id="d234fn6">August 27.</note> Egyptians launched “regular offensive” with some military units penetrating rather deeply as illustrated by the action near Askelon (Embassy telegram 172<note n="7" xml:id="d234fn7">Dated August 27, it reported that the Foreign Ministry had informed the Embassy of three Egyptian incursions that evening: an attack on an Israeli military vehicle, the ambush of a taxi cab, and the destruction of a well. (Department of State, Central Files, 674.84A/8–2755)</note>) some 12 kilometers inside Israel. In reply to my inquiry as to whether there was any doubt as to [garble] Egyptian action, he stated that Israel now held uniform Egyptian who was wounded in the action and who admitted that he was member of one of several groups which had been sent into Israel to ambush and sabotage. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> laid considerable stress on the depth of penetration angle and the startling effect this had on the public security-wise, just as he did when he defended the Gaza incident of February 28.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_413" n="413" facs="0441"/>
                        <p>He then said, as in effect he has twice said during the past two weeks (Embassy telegrams 117 [<hi rend="italic">171</hi>]<note n="8" xml:id="d234fn8">See <ref target="#d229fn3">footnote 3, Document 229</ref>.</note> and 172) “surely <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> realizes that two can play the same game.”</p>
                        <p>He then launched into his theme that Egypt has no right to remain in Gaza—she is there only under terms of the armistice and she has so abused her position that she should no longer be permitted to remain; the Egyptians are “invaders.” The question arises as to whether this can be tolerated any longer. He then said, “Please inform the United States Government that Egypt should be made to clear out of Gaza—she had used it as a springboard for violent action against Israel—she has violated the armistice and cannot claim its protection, she cannot have it both ways.”</p>
                        <p>“Why is <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> doing this?” He said, “I am no mind reader and I cannot be certain why he has adopted this policy. It must be because of one or two of the following reasons: (a) his desire to cement the Arab front around Israel; (b) he may wish to provoke Israel into a major action; (c) he may wish to bolster up his tottering regime.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> was convinced that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> broke off the Gaza talks to clear the decks for this current action and every conceivable effort had been made to convince <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> that “he should behave.” In considering why <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> acted as he has, <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> reiterated his former statement to me, that is, “<persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> has the idea that he can carry on these aggressions (implying that they would be kept below level of major military action) without fear of drastic reactions on the part of Israel, because the United States will continue to bring pressure on Israel not to retaliate.”</p>
                        <p>I remarked, that I doubted that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> really believed that, but if <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had thought so I certainly hoped that by now, due to our representations to him, his mind has been completely disabused of the idea. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> said he hoped so, “but it (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>) will depend on what will happen during the next two or three nights.”</p>
                        <p>I immediately picked up this remark, hoping it indicated the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> was holding up action on the Gaza border to await indicative actions by Egypt. I repeated his remark and asked if it might not be logical to see in the next two or three nights a direct reflection of our counseling to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> to abandon any aggressive program he might have in mind. He thought that might well be the case, implying that continued Egyptian military action would show clearly that US Counsel was having no effect. I could not, however, elicit from him any statement or indication that the <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> was holding up action until there is proof that our pressures on <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> were effective. The great danger of a continuation of these incidents was, he <pb xml:id="pg_414" n="414" facs="0442"/>said, that the people living on the border would leave the area or they would become “war-minded.” He did not say so, but I assumed that the latter development applied to some sizeable segments of the general public as well.</p>
                        <p>He remarked that he considered it a tragedy that the Gaza talks, which had been proceeding for some time and which held for him so much hope, should have been renounced by Egypt—first Egypt opens fire on an Israel patrol in Israel territory; then Egypt breaks off the talks; then Egypt embarks on a regular offensive.</p>
                        <p>He again referred to Israel intelligence reports to the effect that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had inferred [informed] other Arab States of his aggressive active program in Gaza (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 172) as indicating that the current incidents are part and parcel of a determined program by Egypt. He thought <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> should be told firmly by the US to stop. I reminded him that we had already approached <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> on that score and that we hoped for effective results. But I fear that he feels our representations are not strong enough, although he did not say so. I make no reference to our specific efforts and results thereof (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 155, Cairo 316<note n="9" xml:id="d234fn9">See <ref target="#d229fn4">footnote 4, Document 229</ref>.</note> and <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 146<note n="10" xml:id="d234fn10">Reference is evidently in error. Telegram 146 from Tel Aviv, August 25, pertained to a consular matter. Presumably reference is to telegram 176 from Tel Aviv, August 28; not printed. For a summary, see <ref target="#d229fn5">footnote 5, Document 229</ref>.</note>) in view of counter-productiveness due to subsequent Egyptian actions.</p>
                        <p>With regard to possibility that retaliatory action by <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> might be construed by world opinion as <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> reply to Secretary’s statement (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 155) he expressed some doubt. He said the speech was a very important document and had been considered by the Cabinet meeting earlier in the day; the Cabinet would give it further study; and that he might wish to discuss it with me in a few days, possibly asking for “<gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to elucidate certain points.” In response to my question as to whether the Cabinet exhibited any definite reaction to the speech, Herzof replied that there were some strong reactions on some points but did not identify them.</p>
                        <p>Comment: The Prime Minister seemed to be in much better spirits than one might expect in view of the rather long and important Cabinet meeting a short time prior to our meeting; the critical situation on the Gaza border with news of new incidents reaching him frequently; he had not heard of the latest one (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 180<note n="11" xml:id="d234fn11">Earlier that day the Embassy in Tel Aviv reported that two Israeli soldiers were killed and that three were wounded when their vehicles struck mines on the highway near Bern. (Department of State, Central Files, 674.84A/8–2655)</note>) (in which two Israel soldiers killed when I saw him), the Syrian <pb xml:id="pg_415" n="415" facs="0443"/>decision re the Israel soldiers (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 170<note n="12" xml:id="d234fn12">
                                <persName corresp="#p_LEB1">Lawson</persName> reported in telegram 170 from Tel Aviv, August 26, that Radio Damascus had announced the decision of the Syrian Government to cancel the prisoner-of-war status that it had previously accorded to four captured Israeli soldiers. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 683.84A/8–2655)</note>) and the very difficult and personally distasteful experiences suffered by him at the hands of <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> during recent weeks. He did not display as much excitement or explosiveness in his comments as I had anticipated. Whether this reflected relief and resignation to important and critical Cabinet decisions today I could not assess, but I felt confident that it did not reflect any great personal victory or success for moderation over activism in the same meeting. He was firm and decisive in his manner but not aggressive.</p>
                        <p>It seemed to me that the outstanding indices to the current <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> attitude toward retaliation in terms somewhat stronger than usual, lie in the emphasis with which he treated certain points. For example, he returned several times to the thesis that Egypt had no right to remain in Gaza, and pondered whether it could long be tolerated; he requested that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> oust Egypt from Gaza; he stressed Egypt’s loss of rights to be in Gaza.</p>
                        <p>I gathered that the discussions in the Cabinet meeting today followed something of the same pattern followed before final decision in February to launch the Gaza incident. Therefore, this coincidence of approach to the present situation seems to support the theory of retaliation on something larger than the usual talk of retaliation of the past.</p>
                        <p>The possible loss of benefits deriving from Secretary’s speech proposals seemed to be of far less concern to him than presence of Egypt in Gaza with the immediate security problem it posed, the deep penetration, the loss of life and associated current problems.</p>
                        <p>With regard to possible immediate action or timing of any phase on a retaliatory action program I sensed, although I had no tangible evidence, that the present plan—probably confirmed at the Cabinet meeting today—is a flexible one which can be activated without delay and whenever the Egyptian aggressions become too frequent, too penetrating, or too intolerable from Israel’s viewpoint and there is no firm policy of awaiting the events of “the next two or three nights.”</p>

                        <p>332. General <persName corresp="#p_AGAH1">Hakim Amer</persName> has just transmitted orally, through Gohar to me, fact that Egypt would welcome cessation present vicious circle along borders which becoming more and more serious. Egypt would be willing to live up to cease-fire if Israel also would agree abide by cease-fire in good faith. If date and time were set for cease-fire and no incidents initiated by Israel during 24-hour period after that date, Egypt on its part would guarantee that no incidents would be instigated by its forces.</p>
                        <p>Believe this proposal most important but am aware it can fail if (1) it is made dependent on Israeli admission for responsibility for commencement present series of incidents, which is implied as side light in part of message transmitted to me, or (2) it is interpreted in Israel as “peace offer” because Egypt weakening under Israeli pressure, as has been implied by recent Israeli broadcasts. To avoid these possibilities suggest <persName>Burns</persName> might approach both sides immediately along following lines: Immediate measures obviously required to restore tranquillity in border region. He, there, proposes, as agent of Security Council, and with reference final paragraph <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution March 30th each side order its military forces suspend any action against the other as from <gloss target="#t_H1">H</gloss> hour on D day, and agree that if during subsequent 24-hour period there are no incidents, cease-fire will be considered to be formally in effect.</p>
                        <p>Have suggested immediate action by <persName>Burns</persName> in view of gravity of situation and apparent importance of this communication from <persName corresp="#p_AGAH1">Hakim Amer</persName>. If <persName>Burns</persName> should decide to act on this recommendation consideration should be given to strengthening his position by follow-up instructions and support to him from Secretary General.</p>

                        <p>180. Had further talk this morning with Foreign Minister Bashayan on Secretary’s August 26 statement (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 172, August 27).<note n="2" xml:id="d236fn2">Not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 684A.86/8–2755)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Bashayan said he was in favor of early meeting of representatives of the Arab States for exchange of views on statement. Jordan [and] Syria in accepting invitation to a conference to consider North African situation (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss>s 166, August 25, 168, August 26 and 170 August 27<note n="3" xml:id="d236fn3">None printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 751S.00/8–2555, 751S.00/8–2655, and 751S.00/8–2755, respectively)</note>) had suggested that Secretary’s statement be considered at same time. Bashayan said he too was in favor of that.</p>
                        <p>I asked Bashayan how far plans for conference on North Africa had progressed. He said all Arab States except Egypt and Saudi Arabia had replied and had accepted invitation to attend such a conference. States replying had suggested Beirut as meeting place. Egypt he anticipated would request that meeting take place at Cairo. That would be acceptable to him.</p>
                        <p>I gather that the level at which this conference is to be held has not up to now been decided. To my question as to when conference might take place Bashayan said within three or four days.</p>
                        <p>Until Arab States can get together for an exchange of views on Secretary’s statement Bashayan said he thought it was important that public stand by various governments on statement be avoided. He regretted very much that certain members of present Government of Syria had already declared themselves publicly against statement. These men he continued as they are members of only a caretaker government are all too inclined to act irresponsibly. Their one aim now is to pile up difficulties for the new incoming government.</p>
                        <p>What about the 1947 <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Resolution Bashayan then asked? No mention of it was made by the Secretary he continued and this has given rise to some unfavorable comment. I told him that it was generally understood that the Arabs took their stand on that resolution. It was equally recognized that the Israelis took their stand on the present frontiers. These clearly would be the starting points in any negotiations but obviously if a settlement were to be reached both Arabs and Israelis would have to make concessions.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_418" n="418" facs="0446"/>
                        <p>Bashayan said he understood that. (Prime Minister Nuri’s reaction to a similar observation of mine was reported in <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 171, August 27.)<note n="4" xml:id="d236fn4">
                                <ref target="#d228">Document 228</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>There remained the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Resolutions on Jerusalem Bashayan continued. Could I say something about them? On the matter of Jerusalem I said I felt I could tell him that the US Government was not committed to any particular solution.</p>
                        <p>There was one more question Bashayan then said that he wanted to ask. How urgent was it for the Arab States to declare themselves on the statement?</p>
                        <p>The main objective of the Secretary’s speech I explained was to get both parties thinking of ways to bring negotiations for a sound settlement to a head. A settlement certainly was urgently needed by both parties but there was not the slightest intention of coercing or rushing the governments concerned into commitments of any kind. It was very important though in my view that an early start be made on exchanging views.</p>
                        <p>But if, Bashayan then asked, representatives of the Arab States get together and it develops that the atmosphere is not propitious for moving toward a settlement would you say that it were best under those circumstances to play for time trying to keep door open for talks at some future more favorable time.</p>
                        <p>I told Bashayan that I felt strongly that if no real progress could be made right now then by all means every effort should be made to keep the door open for another attempt at a later more favorable time.</p>
                        <p>Before we parted Bashayan reiterated his deep interest in the Secretary’s statement. He said he would continue to give it very careful consideration. He had one suggestion he would like to make now. When the negotiations which he so much hoped would materialize reach the problem of refugees he would like to see Doctor Izzet Tannous Director of the Arab Refugees Office in New York brought into the picture. Tannous whom he described as a Palestinian refugee could he said give much valuable detailed information.</p>

However, believe reaction can be summarized as readiness keep door open examine proposals.</p>
                        <p>My British colleague is proposing and I concur, that Secretary and possibly <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> issue statements on eve Arab League Political Committee Cairo session September 3. Statement might take form response to press conference question and/or might be communicated to governments concerned by US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> diplomatic representatives. Statement could take note some encouraging response to Secretary’s proposals and disposition give them serious consideration. Suggestion could then be made that if parties willing, Secretary would be glad meet representatives countries concerned separately or in groups during his presence Europe October to explore further steps which might be desirable.</p>
                        <p>Such statement would signify continuing US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> interest and might forestall negative or restrictive action which might hamper future negotiations. Statement would have advantage also maintaining momentum while at same time keeping question methods and forums completely flexible.</p>
                        <p>Embassy believes Trieste pattern offers best chance in view great difficulty if not impossibility bringing parties together for direct talks at this stage and generally confusing possibilities of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> jurisdiction. Embassy also believes if US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> play broker role far preferable negotiate with representatives countries concerned keeping decisions out of Arab League if possible. We would hope negotiations might be confined as much as possible to states bordering Israel, thus eliminating obstructionist role such states as Saudi Arabia, Yemen.</p>

                        <p>“Why should I read it; let those whose task it may be to comment do so. Did I not give your Ambassador my personal view?: We can never live with Israel. Will Americans ever understand this fact; nothing they can do can change it.</p>
                        <p>“They will probably say in Washington I am their enemy, as an officer in their Near East section recently said. But why; I am simply speaking truth, truth which every Arab feels.</p>
                        <p>“No such statement can really help. Why should America concern itself with us or with Israel; let it pull out and leave us alone. Such interference can only injure Saudi-American relations.</p>
                        <p>“What they are doing is against nature. It may have temporary result; but in last analysis only one of us can be sovereign in Palestine”.</p>
                        <p>2. As yet there has been no editorial comment in only Saudi daily newspaper, semi-official <hi rend="italic">Bilad Al-Saudiyah</hi>. It did however publish factually accurate news story August 28, and we may expect something in its weekly political commentary next Friday.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_423" n="423" facs="0451"/>
                        <p>Further on August 30 it published brief news roundup of comments by Jordan Prime Minister Mufti and Syrian President-Elect Quwatli, Prime Minister Asali and Faris Khouri—all non-commital except Khouri’s which warned Arabs against “this new danger in American policy.” One Cairo item added that Arab Foreign Ministers would meet there September 3 to discuss <persName>Dulles</persName> statement.</p>
                        <p>Roundup ended “statement is being studied carefully by high (Saudi) authorities to end Saudi views may be communicated other Arab States with view reaching unified decision.”</p>

                                <ref target="#d224">Document 224</ref>.</note> my British colleague informs me that he has requested reconsideration by Foreign Office tripartite formula on Jerusalem question.<note n="3" xml:id="d241fn3">The Embassy in London reported on September 12 that the French Embassy had informed the British Foreign Office that the French Government had reconsidered the tripartite formula on Jerusalem and had concluded that in order to strengthen <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> and the moderates, the diplomatic representatives in Israel should be authorized to conduct business with <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> in Jerusalem. (Telegram 995; Department of State, Central Files, 784A.00/9–1255)</note> His arguments were as follows:</p>
                        <p>First, he believes agreed line of approach would precipitate a bitter and sterile quarrel in new government and would react adversely upon prospects successful followup Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> statement August 26.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, he quoted <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> as having told him <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName> would not make it easy for us to avoid dealing with Foreign Minister and that given state of his own relations with <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName> it would be impossible for <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> to help us out of difficulty by meeting elsewhere than in Jerusalem. Nicholls concluded that present instructions would make our dealings with Israel Government infinitely more difficult and weaken <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> and moderate elements at a critical period.</p>
                        <p>He proposed therefore following variations present instructions,</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_424" n="424" facs="0452"/>
                        <p>“If normal dealings with Foreign Ministry are out of question, even with assurances that no political capital would be made of them.”</p>
                        <p>1. No indication to be made to new Prime Minister of our line.</p>
                        <p>2. A courtesy call would be paid on new Foreign Minister.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> would be informed that question whether Heads of Missions can call on him at Foreign Ministry would not be decided for a month or two because possibility prejudicing Israel-Arab negotiations and that, in meantime, he should agree to meet us either elsewhere in Jerusalem or Tel Aviv.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Embassy Comment:</hi> I agree with British Ambassador’s analysis of underlying situation. Important point seems to be to keep operations working on practical basis but in no way prejudicing Israel-Arab negotiations or in fact contravening <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution on Jerusalem. In any event the temporary character of these operations and avoidance publicity should be insisted upon whatever arrangements are made.</p>
                        <p>Therefore if arrangement under point 3 can be made and publicity controlled and practical working conditions as now exist can continue we would avoid for moment (a) adverse reactions on prospects of following up Secretary’s statement (b) bitter and sterile dispute with new government (c) prejudicing <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>’s position vis-à-vis <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName> and Cabinet.</p>
                        <p>Alternative would be for an effort to be made to force <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> to agree to meet us alternatively at Foreign Office and Tel Aviv an agreement which I rather doubt he would make except under compelling conditions. Even if arranged, it would place us in position of recognizing Foreign Office in Jerusalem in operational sense, something we would avoid under British Ambassador’s proposal point 3.</p>

                        <p>In telegram 61 from Jerusalem, August 31, Consul General <persName corresp="#p_CWEJ1">Cole</persName> reported that Major General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> was issuing a press release regarding the cease-fire which would state that the Egyptians had agreed to a cease-fire and said they would issue orders to implement it and that <persName>Burns</persName> was endeavoring to obtain Israeli agreement to a cease-fire. (Department of State, Central Files, 674.84A/8–3155) Telegram 196 from Jerusalem, also dated August 31, transmitted the text of the Israeli reply to <persName>Burns</persName>’ proposal. It declared that the <pb xml:id="pg_425" n="425" facs="0453"/>events of the past week were the sole responsibility of the Egyptian authorities and rejected a cease-fire unless the Egyptian Government accepted responsibility for those acts and was ready to guarantee the immediate cessation of all hostile acts.

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> telephoned from Cairo that afternoon and talked to Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern, South Asian, and African Affairs <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">John A. Jernegan</persName>. A memorandum of the conversation, drafted by Officer in Charge of Egypt and Anglo-Egyptian Sudan Affairs <persName corresp="#p_BWC1">William C.

                        <p>“Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> telephoned from Cairo to state the following:</p>
                        <p>“I am convinced that the Egyptian Government is doing everything it can to control the situation in Gaza and to observe the cease fire. <persName corresp="#p_AGAH1">Hakim Amer</persName>, Commander-in-Chief of the Egyptian Army, is personally in Gaza to see that the Government’s orders are carried out. However, some Egyptian personnel may still be out of communications with headquarters. Because of the messages I have seen I am worried that something may happen. I am not pessimistic over the situation here provided we can keep something big from happening on the other side during the next two days. Egypt may issue a public statement about the cease fire. You may wish to consider asking the Secretary to telephone <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> and tell him that we are convinced the Egyptians mean what they said to General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> and will observe the cease fire.</p>
                        <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> replied that he would report the conversation to the Secretary.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.)</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> telephoned Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LEB1">Lawson</persName> in Tel Aviv at 2:40 that afternoon. Notes of the conversation prepared by <persName>Dulles</persName>’ secretary, <persName corresp="#p_BPD1">Phyllis D. Bernau</persName>, read as follows:</p>
                        <p>“The <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss>. said he wanted him to know that we believe that the Egyptians really intend in good faith to try to get a cease fire there, and the <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss>. hopes very much <gloss target="#t_L1">L</gloss>. can do something with his friends. The <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss>. wants Mr. Sharrett to know that he is personally convinced that they are in good faith trying to call it off and hopes for reciprocity. <gloss target="#t_L1">L</gloss>. will be in touch right away. The <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss>. said to tell Sharrett he did phone him personally and requested him personally to carry that information to him.” (Eisenhower Library, Dulles Papers, General Telephone Conversations)</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> arrived in Cairo on August 31.</note> Yesterday during long session with <gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> Ministerial <gloss target="#t_comite1">Comite</gloss> I stated following position in response Prime Minister’s points (Amman telegram 99 to Department<note n="3" xml:id="d243fn3">Dated August 30, it reported that at an informal meeting the previous day, the Prime Minister stated that Jordan was prepared to accept the Jordan Valley proposals on economic grounds if certain modifications could be agreed upon: (1) construction of a dam at Maqarin capable of supporting a possible future increase in dam height from 126 meters (300 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">MCM</gloss> storage capacity) to 147 meters (460 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">MCM</gloss> capacity); (2) adjustments in the amount of upper Jordan River water available from Tiberias; and (3) more specific “guarantees” as to action in the event of a violation. The telegram further stated that Jordan insisted that a political decision be taken in concert with a subcommittee of interested Arab States in Cairo. (Department of State, Central Files, 684A.85322/8–3055)</note>).</p>
                        <p>1. We prepared recommend financing 126-meter (300 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">MCM</gloss>) dam at Maqarin but cannot recommend expenditure additional funds to construct uneconomically large foundation on highly speculative possibility that Jordan will increase dam height in future. Even in unlikely event Jordan later obtains necessary funds and thus becomes able make political decision store more water Arab territory, it is uncertain whether dam would be raised, additional dam on Yarmuk would be constructed or Tiberias arrangements continued.</p>
                        <p>2. We conceded that Israel due 25 rather than 40 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">MCM</gloss> from Yarmuk for Jordan-Yarmuk triangle. However we maintained position <gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> requirements adequately met by 100 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">MCM</gloss> of upper Jordan water from Tiberias. Thorough discussion engineering data has confirmed that total quantity available to <gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> adequate irrigate all arable lands Jordan Valley. (Incidentally information given us privately from informed source indicates ground water explorations more encouraging than previously known.)</p>
                        <p>3. Question neutral supervision not discussed in formal session but we explored with ministers most concerned and submitted written proposals for supervision to <gloss target="#t_comite1">comite</gloss>. Jordanians indicated more interest in guarantees than in machinery supervision.</p>
                        <p>Pursuant Prime Minister’s suggestion I have supplied him with letter reaffirming that our proposals do not “in any way alter or prejudice the refugees right to repatriation or compensation” and that it is “not intended to have any other political effect with respect to boundaries, territorial claims, rights or responsibilities under the several general armistice agreements or any other outstanding political issue.”</p>

                        <p>At <gloss target="#t_comite1">comite</gloss>’s specific suggestion we handed them a “memo of United States proposals” embodying all elements of proposed understanding in our terms. If accepted memo would provide solid foundation for basic agreement both sides.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> In my judgment <gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> seriously wants project but must surmount several difficulties.

Moreover, the Israelis were referring to this incident as evidence that Egypt was not conforming to <persName>Burns</persName>’ request for a cease-fire. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.)</note> and 196<note n="3" xml:id="d244fn3">See <ref target="#d242">Document 242</ref>.</note> arrived just prior appointment with <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> arranged for <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Eric Johnston</persName>. Prior discussion <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>’s business stated new matters had arisen of such urgency that I must request him again to see Prime Minister and/or Minister of War without delay. <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> started immediately arrange appointment with General <persName corresp="#p_AGAH1">Hakim Amer</persName> but recalled he had left for border.</p>
                        <p>Gave <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> my view situation nearly out of hand. He stated he had authority to assure me that Egypt doing everything within its power to live up to unequivocable commitment given yesterday to General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_AGAH1">Hakim Amer</persName> had gone to border to personally do everything within his power to get word to commando types inside Israel. I stated it of utmost importance that Israel know without <pb xml:id="pg_428" n="428" facs="0456"/>delay Egypt really trying to prevent further incidents. He stated he had given me his statement with thought that perhaps we could see it got to right places. I asked if such a statement could be made to General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> as well in any communication they might send him. He replied that it could.</p>
                        <p>I said I unaware of any communication <persName>Burns</persName> might have made to them but asked their reaction as to how to treat last paragraph Israeli statement Tel Aviv’s 196. <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> replied that obviously they could not accept responsibility that things had gotten to point they now were. I therefore replied it best ignore this part of Israeli statement and in addition to new assurances to <persName>Burns</persName> make an immediate public statement of their position. This would merely take note of the Israeli statement but not attempt to refute allegation last paragraph. <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> replied their position would be well known to <persName>Burns</persName> and Secretary General. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Ahmed Hussein</persName> who present joined me in urging a public statement with high authority be made without delay. <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> said it might be possible and they would consider it carefully.</p>
                        <p>From other sources close to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> situation here seems quite clear. Some of the National Guard types and commandos who took off with specific harassing missions are to an extent at least untraceable at moment. I do not doubt slightest that every effort is being made to stop it. Egyptian acceptance of cease fire was broadcast yesterday evening and this morning in hope it would be heard by Egyptian commandos still in Israel (now believed to number about 5). On other hand Government here now believes that Israel may attack tonight or tomorrow and possibly make real effort regarding Gaza. Egypt would feel impelled react (probably elsewhere). No one in authority here really wants this to happen and while Egyptians over optimistic and not apparently too concerned at their ability militarily make good showing initially there is a real realization that it would be a defeat for Egypt and <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> no matter what happens. They also now thinking in terms of what it would do to U.S.-Egyptian relations and our past support for this regime regardless of who won first round.</p>
                        <p>In spite of seriousness of situation <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> content with second hand contact with me at moment due to his internal problems. Salah Salem’s wild accusations before <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> colleagues during resignation scene that he being tossed over at insistence this Embassy has made him cautious until he can be more at ease over this split of <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>.<note n="4" xml:id="d244fn4">Salah Salem’s resignation as a member of the Revolutionary Command Council and as Minister for Sudanese Affairs as well as Minister for National Guidance had been announced earlier that day.</note> Mohamed Haikel who spending most his time now in this crisis <pb xml:id="pg_429" n="429" facs="0457"/>with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> personally is now enroute to see whether we have further ideas.</p>

He appreciated your interest and expressed regret that he had to refer to Egyptian reprehensible actions. He promised to take up matter first thing in morning. He asked that I convey his respect and personal good wishes to you.</p>

According to a memorandum of the conversation by <persName corresp="#p_WF1">Wilkins</persName>, Jackson told <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> that he had met with <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> on July 15, immediately before <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName>’s departure for Cairo, and that <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> had indicated that the Egyptians considered the time ripe for the commencement of talks between Israel and Egypt, for intensification of <gloss target="#t_AFSC1">AFSC</gloss> efforts, and for an “imaginative approach to the problem.” Jackson stated that he planned to visit Israel and the Arab States in August and could continue discussions with the Egyptian and Israeli authorities. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> expressed interest and approved of Jackson continuing his efforts.

Jackson also meeting with <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName> later this morning. Embassy endeavoring to arrange plane transportation to Cairo out of Kalandia this afternoon. At request both Jackson and Foreign Minister I am arranging to meet with him prior his departure to obtain precise information re proposals and will report immediately to the Department.<note n="4" xml:id="d247fn4">See <ref target="#d253">Document 253</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Previous activities Jackson were reported by him to me yesterday as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. Held two and one-half hour conversation with <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> with no firm results other than development his interest in whole exercise.</p>
                        <p>2. Held hour-long conversation with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>, net result being development interest to desire continuation of exercise with definite hope Jackson’s return Cairo following visit to Israel; specific inquiry as to details Israel-held Egyptian prisoners and what pattern joint narcotic traffic control; strong and final dissipation <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s confidence in “anyone in Israel”.</p>
                        <p>3. Sessions with <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName> and Rafael held immediately on Jackson’s arrival here evening August 29 at behest Israelis. This produced intense, sharp questioning of Jackson regarding <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> reactions to definite points transmitted by <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> appeared in role of more agitated and emphatic questioner than <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName> and when subject Gaza raid February 28 discussed offered only defense. It was significant that when Jackson explained this action was basis <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s complete abandonment confidence in Israel leaders, <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> never removed his eyes from <pb xml:id="pg_432" n="432" facs="0460"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName>, who we assume promoted Gaza action in opposition <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Jackson was asked if he would return Cairo following day bearing message to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>. Matter seemed so urgent that offer was made to fly Jackson to Athens to make plane connections without delay—much depended on immediate delivery of message. But during night the thoroughly upsetting Egyptian raids forced change in Israel plan and execution message idea postponed.</p>

He has been wondering whether there is anything more we can do to prevent these taking a <pb xml:id="pg_434" n="434" facs="0462"/>negative form. All the evidence suggests that the attitude of Egypt will be decisive. The Iraqi Prime Minister has said that his attitude will depend on that of Egypt. The Syrian and Jordanian Prime Ministers have both stressed the importance of consultation with other Arab States, and clearly await a lead from Egypt. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> thinks we must therefore do our utmost to see that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s lead is not a negative one, or at least that he does not demand a closing of the doors. He is in a strange frame of mind, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> is not confident that he will behave helpfully. In particular, there is the danger that he may feel compelled to take an extreme line through fear of being outbid by the Iraqi Prime Minister, with whom he is already competing over Morocco and other matters. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> suggests therefore that we should make an immediate approach to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>. The object would be to inform him that we have reason to think that the Iraqis (and others) will adopt a constructive attitude towards your proposals if Egypt gives a lead in that sense. We could add that we should use all our influence with Iraq and other Arab States in that direction.</p>
                        <p>4. The second purpose of the approach should, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> thinks, be to give <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> a little more confidential background about our ideas than he has hitherto received, and to reassure him over certain points on which there seems from various statements to be danger of misunderstanding. In the first place, it is worth considering whether we might now indicate to him in confidence, as an example of the kind of ideas we have in mind, the principle (but, of course, not any application) of the triangles in the Negev. We would not ask him to commit himself in any way to this principle.</p>
                        <p>5. Other points which might be made are:</p>
                        <p>a) that the statement did not, as has been alleged, ignore the possibility of the return of some refugees to Israel;</p>
                        <p>b) that we have an open mind as to how the compensation for refugees would be administered, and would be glad to discuss this with the Governments concerned;</p>
                        <p>c) that, of course, the proposed treaties of guarantee have nothing to do with Middle East defence;</p>
                        <p>d) that we fully realise that this is only a beginning and that all the problems cannot be solved at once. All we are asking is that the parties should be willing to embark on a process of seeking solutions which might lead to a radical improvement of relations and eventually to an overall settlement.</p>
                        <p>6. In view of the above, our representatives might conclude by saying that for all these reasons we hope <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> will agree as to the importance of avoiding any open rejection by the Arab League of your initiative. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> concludes by saying that he would be glad to hear your views so that agreement may be reached on instructions for a joint approach in Cairo.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_435" n="435" facs="0463"/>
                        <p>7. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> has also studied the circular telegram of instructions to the United States representatives in Arab countries and has only one comment to make. It is about your suggestion that “views might be exchanged as to a person or commission designated by a government or person agreed upon by both sides.”<note n="5" xml:id="d249fn5">Quoted from <ref target="#d238">Document 238</ref>.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> fears that if the parties chose an unsuitable government or person the operation might pass out of our control. He has therefore suggested that the relevant sentence should read “the exchange of views of various parties might therefore be achieved through a suitable person or commission designated by the United Nations or through those governments who are prepared to contribute towards the achievement of a settlement.”</p>
                        <p>8. I took the opportunity this afternoon of mentioning these points briefly to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> for whom I am sending copies of this letter. I also understand that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> has discussed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>’s views with a member of my staff.</p>

                        <p>355. Conversation with <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> night before last covered number of matters which being reported separately. In general conversation that followed after completion my specific items he stated that some things must be encouraging to me. Certainly we should be pleased to see drastic action taken last weekend re some of the worst leftist elements in the press. (It will interest Department that one of reported reasons for action re press was <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s displeasure that they overplayed and sought to put more into his possible visit to Moscow than he desired.) Stated in this connection he considered it more and more important that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> be invited to United States if possible without much delay. Certainly they hoped for an invitation <pb xml:id="pg_436" n="436" facs="0464"/>before the tentative time set for <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s Moscow visit early next year. I replied that this matter to which I had given much thought as I knew President and Secretary would be delighted to see such a visit take place under appropriate timing and atmosphere. <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> then speculated as to whether invitation delivered by <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> (as rumored here in press) would be in time and finally decided perhaps it would be.</p>
                        <p>In my second meeting with <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> (after he had talked to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> by phone re world situation) <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> raised matter again and said he wished to correct impression given me in our first meeting as regards timing. (I gathered matter had just been discussed but do not know whether at <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s or <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName>’s initiative. Perhaps it came up in connection <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s expression concern to <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> re Secretary’s statement on Soviet arms reported <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 345.)<note n="2" xml:id="d250fn2">According to telegram 345, <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> informed <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> on August 30 that “<persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> quite upset over report that Secretary stated today’s press conference that if Government of Egypt should receive arms from Soviet Union this would badly affect U.S.-Egyptian relations, etc. Stated that if this report were correct, he considered it a most unwelcome public approach on one of his principal problems.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 611.74/8–3055) On August 31, <persName>Dulles</persName> informed <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> “I made no statement with reference to Egypt receiving arms and when asked what countries might be involved in possible Soviet arms I refused to answer.” The Secretary also told <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> to treat this report as a “personal message from me to <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName>.” (Telegram 415 to Cairo; <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> 774.56/ 8–3155)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> went on to say that they now felt timing of invitation very important and hoped, if United States agreeable, <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> should visit States sometime that invitation could be issued without delay. I stated as he knew these matters difficult to fit in President’s schedule and our invitations normally included a suggested time for visit if convenient for invitee. Did he have any suggestions in this regard, particularly in view of <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s reported feeling he unable to leave Egypt until sometime after anticipated change in form of Government in January? <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> stated that timing of invitation was what was important now rather than actual time of visit. If we agreed he would suggest a communication from the President indicating a desire to have the Prime Minister visit United States at time to be mutually agreed later. Stated that if we worried about President’s schedule, he could make this kind of approach without concern that actual visit might be this year and that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s reply could be one of pleasure at invitation and acceptance, leaving vague actual timing. Additional probing on timing of invitation and new apparent urgency from their point of view elicited only remark that it probably best invitation did not come for “about ten days—but as soon as possible thereafter.”</p>
                        <p>I closed conversation by indicating I certain Washington would be highly interested what had been communicated to me. He stated
<pb xml:id="pg_437" n="437" facs="0465"/>he realized I could not on my own give any indication but hoped we would consider matter carefully.</p>
                        <p>Must confess do not know what has caused this note of urgency on their part for invitation. Considering however believe it in our interest find some way follow through on <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> suggestion. Realize that formal open-handed invitation from President very unusual and that problem further complicated by fact that invitation worded “next spring” or “early next year” would give appearance of competing with Kremlin. Useful alternative of formal invitation might be letter to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> from President stating he has long felt it would be useful have personal exchange of views in United States on matters of mutual interest and that he is hoping that if <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> also thinks this a good idea he will bear the suggestion in mind and communicate with the President at a later date when they would fix a mutually acceptable date.</p>
                        <p>We would not of course expect deliver letter until immediate situation on borders has quieted down.<note n="3" xml:id="d250fn3">The Department responded on September 3 that “We do not believe that invitation should be extended to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> at this time. Public knowledge of US invitation to either Egyptian or Israeli Premier prior to acceptance and implementation of <persName>Burns</persName> proposals re Gaza would give impression US was partial.” (Telegram 442 to Cairo; <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> 611.74/9–155)</note>

                        <p>He replied with feeling that they deeply appreciated our efforts during this recent crisis. Egypt in difficult position as she could, of course, not publicly indicate, commandos out of control. Refugees probably could not be completely controlled and individuals likely to go across border to revenge refugee deaths of last night.<note n="3" xml:id="d251fn3">On the evening of August 31, the Israelis attacked Khan Yunis in the southern portion of the Gaza Strip, killing more than 30 Palestinian refugees and Egyptian soldiers. The Embassy in Tel Aviv reported on September 1 that Israeli casualties were one killed and eight wounded and that the Israeli justification for the attack was self-defense against Egyptian terrorist gangs. (Telegram 200; Department of State, Central Files, 674.84A/9–155)</note> I asked if he did not have enough people to picket borders. He replied he only had his troops and obviously could not place them in such a drawn-out and exposed position. Stated I felt if Israel convinced Egypt doing what it could there was at least a chance things could be kept under control, but if Egypt made decision to retaliate re last night, then I felt situation hopeless. He told me there were no such orders now. He had in fact issued orders to retaliate (in operation to be “smaller” than Israeli action last night) but <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had stopped him. I said day would come when he would thank <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> for this act. Obtained impression matter probably not completely settled and that he may still try get <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s approval conduct small operation. Arrival <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>’s message therefore timely and hope this new factor will [apparent omission] <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> stick to his position.</p>
                        <p>This is indeed touchy situation and hope in assessing it history of past period not be forgotten. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> said today he felt I knew in my six months here that he had ordered no operations inside Israel until these past few days. Things, he admits, now very difficult and in some cases out of control.</p>
                        <p>Can appreciate extreme difficulties being experienced by <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. Nevertheless, still feel that we would not be in this situation but for February 28.</p>
                        <p>There has been, and even is today, in my mind quite a contrast between situation such as here and one that is reflected by a long history of Cabinet decisions to conduct military operations across Arab borders.</p>

                        <p>On September 1, Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> sent President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>, who was in Denver, Colorado, a letter reviewing a number of matters, including the current situation in Gaza and the status of Alpha. On these subjects, <persName>Dulles</persName> wrote the following:</p>
                        <p> “Today’s trouble spot is the Gaza strip. I hope, however, that it will not lead to full-scale war. I spoke over the phone yesterday with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LEB1">Lawson</persName> at Tel Aviv …. I told the Ambassador that I was confident that Egypt’s cease-fire offer was genuine and that it was up to the Israelis to respond in kind. They nevertheless struck across the border, but then withdrew; so that could be the end—unless Egypt now feels it has to strike again.</p>
                        <p> “The initial reaction in the Arab States to our ‘Alpha’ project is not as violently against as was feared, but probably the official reaction will initially be negative. Israel and Jewish sentiment seems more favorable than anticipated. I am more than ever convinced that the move was a good one.” (Eisenhower Library, Whitman File, <persName>Dulles</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> Series)</p>

                                <ref target="#d247">Document 247</ref>.</note>) informs me that he met with <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> and later <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName> today who have requested that he take important message to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>. Jackson arriving Cairo 1845 this evening (Cairo time) and will endeavor through own efforts meet <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> on urgency basis. Later he will report developments to Embassy Cairo but feels direct association himself and Embassy at this time should be kept to minimum. Jackson hopes to receive from <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> sufficient encouragement to warrant return to Israel, which very much desired by <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName>, although Jackson probably meeting Rafael in Cyprus September 3 for secret talks with <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName>, Jackson convinced that Israel, now that it has made sharp retaliation, feels it has balanced the score and taught Egyptians a lesson and is anxious that all violence on border and sabotage within <pb xml:id="pg_440" n="440" facs="0468"/>Israel can be completely stopped. To that end, the messages consist of two proposals to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>:</p>
                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> will accept General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName>’ cease-fire<note n="3" xml:id="d253fn3">See <ref target="#d242">Document 242</ref>.</note> if <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> will give complete and satisfactory assurance that the armistice will be strictly observed and all acts of sabotage and violence stopped. This means not only military action on border but mining and sabotage.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName> think it very important that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> be directly informed on sabotage acts within Israel, which have so completely aroused all of the country, and that he believe that they are taking place. In reply to my specific and clear question Jackson said that at no time was mention made of an Israeli requirement that <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> acknowledge and take responsibility for acts which have led to this round of retaliations on both sides, a condition included in <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> reply to <persName>Burns</persName> request for cease-fire (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 196).</p>
                        <p>2. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> will agree to 48-hour complete cease-fire (including mining and sabotage activity), during which it hopes that arrangements can be worked out for some kind of discussions which would set stage for strict and complete observance of armistice. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would agree that such conference would involve no discussions outside armistice operation but would not limit conferees to military people only.

At time message received Israel troops already cross Gaza border. But now, Israel “not engaged in firing” and would not resume firing unless Egypt provoked such action.

Regardless of who was responsible for the current trouble along the border, a continuation of the present situation could only result in disaster to each side. (Department of State, Central Files, 674.84A/8–3155)</note> and in obvious effort to underscore the sincerity of his desire to find an effective formula, he dwelt at some length on the continued and varied means he had used to send messages to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> in past with <pb xml:id="pg_442" n="442" facs="0470"/>regard to Israel’s genuine desire to end trouble on the border. He named several members of British Parliament who acted as intermediaries and referred to occasions on which he had described to me his desires and efforts along that line, with implication that Israel position must have been transmitted to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> through our Embassy Cairo. He said he was still at loss to understand why <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> has initiated incidents and permitted the operation of Egyptian gangs of trained saboteurs in Israel.

                        <p>On Friday afternoon, September 2, reports from Gaza indicated that the fighting had quieted down and that no crisis was impending.</p>
                        <p>Later that afternoon I asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName>, Mr. Wainhouse, and their staffs, to review the situation with me and to consider appropriate courses of action in the event that hostilities should be resumed. During the meeting Mr. Wainhouse brought in a long telegram which had been received from our Delegation in New York (<gloss target="#t_UNMIS1">unmis</gloss> 207, September 2, copy attached<note n="2" xml:id="d258fn2">Not found attached.</note>). Briefly, General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> stated it was imperative in his opinion that a meeting of the Security Council should be called, as he felt any further moves on his part would prove fruitless in preventing renewed hostilities. He specifically proposed that such a meeting would call for a cease-fire, with certain specific additional proposals to physically separate the antagonistic elements.</p>
                        <p>In view of the lull in hostilities Friday afternoon, and after discussion with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> in Massachusetts, we recommended that the Security Council not be called at that time.</p>
                        <p>This morning, however, the ticker carried reports of renewed hostilities in the Gaza area and a heavy artillery duel lasting for approximately 70 minutes. After consultation with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName>, Mr. Wainhouse, and their staffs, and after several conversations with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> on the telephone, we decided that there appeared no alternative except to ask for a meeting of the Security Council.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> found great objection from both the British and the French to having the <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> call for a meeting on his own initiative “for constitutional reasons”. In view of (a) the resumption of hostilities, and (b) British and French objections, it is planned that the British, French, and ourselves will request a Council meeting for Wednesday, September 7. The British and French are wiring their Foreign Offices for instructions and confirmation, and believe they will have no difficulty in obtaining authorization by Monday, September 5.</p>
                        <p>In discussing details of the title of the agenda item, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and Mr. Wainhouse are taking great <gloss target="#t_CARE1">care</gloss> to restrict the wording so that it will not be necessary to determine the guilt of <pb xml:id="pg_446" n="446" facs="0474"/>either party in the starting of these hostilities, and therefore avoid as much acrimonious debate as possible in the meeting, and furthermore to prevent any remote possibility of discussion ranging to such subjects as your Near East speech. The title of the agenda item will relate to a cease-fire and future acts, rather than to past.</p>

                        <p>3. Colonel Harkabi, Chief <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> Intelligence, called Military Attaches together 5 p.m. yesterday and made following points.</p>
                        <p>(a) <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> Intelligence knows that Egyptians have transferred two divisions from Delta area to east of the Canal. <gloss target="#t_ONE1">One</gloss> of these is moving to reinforce other Egyptian forces in north Sinai area.</p>
                        <p>(b) This fact, coupled with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s instability, his precarious position, and his known habit of “pushing on” has made it necessary for Israel to undertake as limited and selective mobilization, Steps have also been taken to expedite further mobilization, if necessary, but the national economy must be considered.</p>
                        <p>(c) Israel hopes General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> efforts to procure truce will be successful. She stands ready (and has so replied to him) to observe strictly such a truce, provided other side observes truce completely, including no feda’in (marauder) activities.</p>

                        <p>On September 5, the United Nations Security Council received a report from Major-General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">E.L.M. Burns</persName>, Chief of Staff of the <pb xml:id="pg_449" n="449" facs="0477"/>United Nations Truce Supervision Organization. In this document, <persName>Burns</persName> detailed the events that had occurred in the Gaza Strip since August 22, and stressed that the repetition of such incidents could be avoided only if Egyptian and Israeli forces were separated by an effective physical barrier along the demarcation line. (U.N. doc. <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>/3430)</p>
                        <p>On September 7, the Permanent Representatives of France, the United Kingdom, and the United States addressed a letter, together with the text of a joint draft resolution, to the President of the Security Council requesting that the Security Council convene as soon as possible to consider a cessation of hostilities and measures to prevent further incidents in the Gaza area. (U.N. doc. <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>/3432)</p>
                        <p>As a result of this tripartite request, the Security Council held its 700th meeting the following day, September 8. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and most of the other members of the Security Council stressed the advisability of refraining from introducing into the debate the question of responsibility for the recent incidents and emphasized the necessity of enforcing the suggestions of the Chief of Staff. After the representatives of Egypt and Israel expressed the positions of their governments, the Security Council unanimously adopted the draft resolution. (U.N. doc. <gloss target="#t_SPV1">S/PV</gloss>. 700)</p>
                        <p>This resolution noted that both Egypt and Israel had accepted the appeal of the Chief of Staff for an unconditional cease-fire; called upon both parties to take all necessary steps to establish order and tranquillity in the Gaza area and, in particular, to desist from acts of violence and to continue the cease-fire in full force and effect; endorsed General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName>’ view that the Egyptian and Israeli Armed Forces should be clearly and effectively separated; held that United Nations observers should have freedom of movement in the area to fulfill their functions; and called upon both parties to appoint representatives to meet with the Chief of Staff and to cooperate with him fully to achieve these ends.

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> stated that recent events had been so turbulent (he was referring to the Gaza border situation), that it had been hard for the Israelis to concentrate their minds on the Secretary’s policy statement of August 26. The Ambassador wished to make some preliminary observations, however, which would be followed up by a conversation between the Israel Prime Minister and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LEB1">Lawson</persName> in Israel. The Israel Government might also address a written memorandum to the U.S. Government in which concrete questions as to certain details of the Secretary’s speech would be raised.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said that the speech had impressed Israel as a serious act of public statesmanship. Israel was aware of the impressive reverberations of the speech throughout the world. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> saw in the speech that the positions of Israel and the U.S. were drawing closer together. Both countries envisaged an Israel living at peace with her neighbors. The concept of perpetual hostility and boycott had been repudiated. The most important single theme of the speech <pb xml:id="pg_452" n="452" facs="0480"/>had been the effect of a U.S. treaty arrangement. The role of such an arrangement in creating conditions of peace and stability had been impressively described.</p>
                        <p>It had been dispiriting for the Israelis to pass to the paragraph dealing with the frontiers. It was unfortunate that a U.S. security guarantee had apparently been linked to changes in the frontiers. This contingency was so remote as not to come within the bounds of feasibility. The statement might therefore contain a “built-in deadlock.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> statement did not place full value on Israel’s present frontiers. Although these frontiers were based on military history, they had endured for seven years. Israel regarded them with an impulse of cherished possession, the Arabs had come to accept them, albeit grudgingly. These frontiers were real, while “agreed frontiers” were intangible. The armistice agreements provided that the demarcation lines could be changed by mutual agreement. In seven years, neither party had invoked these provisions. This amounted to Arab recognition of the frontiers. The United States had entered into treaty arrangements with Germany and the Republic of Korea which in effect guaranteed frontiers no more fixed in their nature than Israel’s.</p>
                        <p>Israel wondered if the U.S. had any specific thoughts about possible frontier adjustments. The problem of land communication among the Arab states was unimportant. Israel would not give up the Negev in whole or in part. In any event the normal communications between Egypt and the other Arab states had always been across the north of Israel. Israel was willing to consider transit arrangements, so the solution of the Arab communication problem lay in an adjustment of the Arab attitude toward Israel, rather than in adjustments of the frontiers. Did the U.S. feel that there was a “physical case” for frontier adjustments? Israel felt that border tension arose not from the <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">shape</gloss> of the frontiers but from Arab relations with Israel. There was no inherent tension in the situation.</p>
                        <p>Israel suggested that this problem be separated from the question of a security treaty. Israel was willing to discuss frontier adjustments with Arabs but felt that it should not be made an obstacle to a security guarantee. In such discussions, Israel would have claims of her own to put forward.</p>
                        <p>Israel had been impressed by the offer of a U.S. loan to finance compensation to the Arab refugees. In due course the Israelis would be placing a specific plan in the hands of the U.S. Government. Israel emphasized the need that compensation paid should be used for the resettlement of the refugees in the Arab states. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> assumed that the problems of the Arab blockade and boycott had <pb xml:id="pg_453" n="453" facs="0481"/>been included in the Secretary’s reference to “other questions, largely economic.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> said that he welcomed the Israel Government’s analysis which showed sympathetic study and consideration of the Secretary’s policy statement. He was not surprised by the restatement of Israel’s desire to obtain a U.S. security guarantee as a first priority. This was probably the major difference between the U.S. and Israel: Israel felt the need for an early U.S. guarantee to prove to the Arabs that Israel was here to stay. The U.S. felt that it would be preferable to work toward our mutual objectives of peace and stability by obtaining Arab agreement rather than cramming a solution down their throats. He emphasized that the Secretary had mentioned “agreed frontiers”; Israel should not assume that all adjustments would have to be at her expense.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador welcomed this observation, but asked if the U.S. Government had excluded the possibility of a security guarantee with Israel based on Israel’s present frontiers. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> replied that the Secretary was acting on the expectation that progress could be achieved along the lines he had proposed and was concentrating on the success rather than the failure of the policy which he had outlined. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> pointed out that the Secretary did not intend to “sit on his hands” in this matter. The speech had not been an end in itself.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> asked if the Ambassador had any comment on the subject of repatriation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> replied that Israel liked the Secretary’s emphasis on resettlement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> felt that the U.S. and Israel might disagree on what might be “the maximum extent feasible” for repatriation.</p>
                        <p>In a personal and informal exchange of views which followed, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> hinted that Israel might be willing to accept Gaza along with its 70,000 indigenous inhabitants. He did not feel that Israel would accept the 200,000 refugees presently encamped there. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> said he hoped the day might come when Arabs could live in Israel as fully accepted citizens and Jews could live in the Arab states in like status. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> concurred but emphasized that Israel could not cast off its roots in Jewish tradition and Hebrew civilization. He thought, however, that the concept of the secular state would triumph both in Israel and the Arab states.</p>

                        <p>223. I called on Nuri at his home this morning. Nuri is leaving for Istanbul tomorrow where his family has been vacationing. He will see his two teen age grandsons off to public school in England and then return to Baghdad with his wife and other members of his family on September 21.</p>
                        <p>I told Nuri that I wanted to have another talk with him on the Secretary’s statement before he got away. I said that I was particularly interested in learning whether the Cabinet had reached any decision.</p>
                        <p>Nuri Said that the Cabinet had decided that if the <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> and Jordan, the two governments most immediately concerned, came out with a favorable reaction to statement, or if Egypt did so alone then the Government of Iraq would do likewise. He then reported what he had said to me previously that he was especially interested in the stand the <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> would eventually adopt. Egypt to him was the key nation.</p>
                        <p>Of all the problems involved, Nuri continued, that of the refugees was the most important. Frontiers came next. A conciliatory gesture by Israel in the field of refugees would in his view contribute more than anything else to preparing the way for coming to grips with the general problem of Arab-Israeli relations. Agreement in principle on Israel’s part to receive refugees would constitute such a gesture. No one knows how many of the refugees want to return to Israel. There may be only a few. If in response to such a gesture by Israel, it developed that a great many wanted to return, then both parties would have to come into the picture. To get at the problem though called for some gesture first from Israel.</p>
                        <p>Would there be an opportunity before long for the Arab states to meet and exchange views on the Secretary’s statement I asked Nuri.</p>
                        <p>Nuri Said that there was talk of another meeting of the Political Committee of the <gloss target="#t_AL1">AL</gloss> on or about September 20. That meeting he continued if it materialized would be on the Foreign Ministry level and Bashayan would of course, attend. Whether he were back from Istanbul by that time or not would make no difference. “Bashayan” he added, “knows my views. He knows I would want him to <pb xml:id="pg_455" n="455" facs="0483"/>encourage full exploration of Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>’ statement and of ways of moving on with it”.</p>
                        <p>As I was leaving, Nuri Said that he was urging upon all his friends not to reject the Secretary’s statement out of haste but to study and weigh it carefully.</p>
                        <p>I told Nuri I was glad to hear that.</p>

                        <p>236. <persName corresp="#p_HCC1">Herzog</persName>, Chief American Division Foreign Ministry, called at Embassy today to discuss press report from Paris that Security Council was to be convened to consider Gaza situation. He repeated <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> views this subject as transmitted <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 230.<note n="2" xml:id="d266fn2">The Embassy in Tel Aviv reported on September 6 in telegram 230 that a senior Israeli Foreign Ministry official had informed the Embassy Counselor that day that Israel “believed <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> consideration Gaza situation at this time was most inadvisable”, on the grounds that 1) a debate there would engender increased bitterness on both the Arab and Israeli sides, and 2) would especially influence Arab public opinion adversely, thus jeopardizing further the attainment of the <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> mission objectives. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 674.84A/9–655)</note> In reply to inquiry as to what alternatives <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> had in mind as a means of getting off dead center problem adequate border controls, <persName corresp="#p_HCC1">Herzog</persName> said that Foreign Ministry had concluded <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss>’s previous adamant attitude in Gaza talks arose (a) from <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s misplaced confidence in Gohar and (b) more importantly, from reluctance of <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> to appear before Arab world as cooperating with Israel. He said Foreign Ministry had arrived at conclusion that it had been a mistake to hold these talks in full public view and to publicize them. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> therefore had arrived at conclusion that best procedure in future was to conduct secret negotiations probably through <persName>Burns</persName> with intermediary to shuffle back and forth between Cairo and Jerusalem.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Embassy comment</hi>: From comments Lourie and <persName corresp="#p_HCC1">Herzog</persName> it appears that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> is at long last learning lesson that road to progress in ironing out difficulties with Arab States does not lie in conduct of <pb xml:id="pg_456" n="456" facs="0484"/>propaganda battles. Secondly, although unmentioned by either Lourie or <persName corresp="#p_HCC1">Herzog</persName>, it is believed <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> has concluded that its condemnation by <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> for Khan Yunis is too high a price to pay for parallel <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> condemnation Egypt for mine laying and homicide squad activities.</p>
                        <p>Of possible interest is opinion of Elmore Jackson, who has had much recent and intimate contact with very high level Egyptians and Israelis. He informed me today he is convinced that sense of restraint and desire to eliminate Gaza border troubles very much more evident both sides. He is likewise convinced neither side desires <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> meeting.</p>
                        <p>He claims: <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>, although unwilling re-engage in Gaza talks at this time will in lieu Gaza talks work through General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> on all armistice matters, thus possibly meeting <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> procedure mentioned above as alternative to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> meeting; <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> gave him definite assurance he would agree to erection of barriers “at certain points on line” thus retreating from previous position, expressed hope some physical separation military forces two countries could be used to remove major source of incidents on border; and in other ways indicated real interest in eliminating tension.</p>
                        <p>He equally if not more impressed with present genuine desire <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> for border quiet. He cited fact that Khan Yunis raid, originally scheduled for night August 29 called off on receipt news <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s conciliatory attitude as reported that evening by Jackson. Orders were countermanded although some Israel units had crossed over border. Spectacular murderous action by Egyptian saboteurs deep in Israel brought Israel raid on Khan Yunis later in week.<note n="3" xml:id="d266fn3">See <ref target="#d251fn3">footnote 3, Document 251</ref>.</note>

                        <p>246. At Prime Minister’s request I called on him at his house in Jerusalem afternoon September 8. Purpose of meeting was to permit him comment on and ask questions on Secretary’s statement.<note n="2" xml:id="d267fn2">Reference is to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ statement of August 26; see <ref target="#d214">Document 214</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>He prefaced his comment with remark that he at this time offering no official document in reply to Secretary’s statement. He was merely making an oral examination of some of points. He would undoubtedly have other comment and questions to ask in future and therefore reserving right to make further comments. He emphasized fact that this not final government position. It was what he termed a “series of marginal notes”. It was an effort to sit down and talk informally about various points concerned and to give expression to some reactions in specific field covered. It was neither thorough-going review nor a discussion of complete statement.</p>
                        <p>First he commented on high standard and character of Secretary’s statement saying it was eminently constructive in spirit and he pleased statement had been made. He especially impressed with basic objective involved which he interpreted to be an “emphatic effort to obtain in Middle East a state of <hi rend="italic">peace and co-existence</hi> between Arabs and Israel.” He thought it extremely important that Israel and Arabs live peacefully together and that Secretary’s statement was effort to bring about that condition.</p>
                        <p>He was favorably impressed with fact statement placed major emphasis on development and constructive tasks. He interpreted warning against arms race as important and encouraging. This would prevent diversion of effort from constructive tasks to destructive action. He reached conclusion from statement that United States does not propose to carry out any one sided arming in area. He then put this in form of question whether this meant “an end to one sided arming” policy of United States and asked if I could get specific reply to this question. He was conscious of fact that there might be no reply to this question or that three replies to his question were possible namely (a) that US already committed to its arms arrangement with Iraq and would necessarily have to continue under that policy (b) US would cease sending arms to Iraq and (c) US would not extend arms aid policy to other Arab States.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_458" n="458" facs="0486"/>
                        <p>With above preliminary background he then decided to discuss some salient points in statement which he termed both constructive points and those on which he had not sufficient information to permit complete consideration which however raised some serious questions and apprehensions.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Refugees</hi>: Under this subject he concluded that statement supported very constructive principle that solution to refugee problem is to be found in <hi rend="italic">resettlement</hi> rather than <hi rend="italic">repatriation</hi>. He made it clear he was not attempting to pin down Secretary to specific statement to that effect but it was clearly a reasonable deduction. Secondly he was impressed with constructive statement of willingness of US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to participate in loan to be used for settlement of refugee problem.</p>
                        <p>He warned of dangers of over simplifying resettlement problem. Solution was not primarily supplying of agricultural land—at least one-third of refugees had been urban dwellers and even remaining two-thirds had not all been engaged in agriculture. Furthermore it might be thought agriculture land provided would have to be irrigated—there were many areas in Arab countries where resettlement could take place and yet irrigation would not be absolutely necessary.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Re compensation by Israel to refugees</hi>: He referred to paragraph I of statement which implies that such compensation would be definitely applied to <hi rend="italic">resettlement</hi> of refugees. He thought this excellent principle and should be strictly adhered to, and that it should be certain that compensation actually be used for resettlement purposes and not dissipated by refugees.</p>
                        <p>He then asked specific question: To whom should compensation funds be paid? Would they be paid to individuals whose property in Israel was involved? Would they be paid to a fund?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Economic Problems</hi>: He said that references under this subject pertained largely he assumed to Arab economic warfare against Israel. Question arose in his mind as to when compensation to refugees was to be paid. He did not mean seen in terms of date but at what stage in settlement. He talked at some length about Arab boycott and losses and inconveniences which it had caused Israel. He spoke particularly of high additional costs of imported oil which is so essential to Israel’s economy. He thought it important that timing of implementation of proposed refugee compensation be in proper relation to cessation of economic warfare.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Jewish Property in Iraq</hi>: He asked what provision would be made for payment of compensation to Jews who left property in Iraq especially property which belongs to Iraqian Jews who now citizens of Israel saying it was definite responsibility of <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to protect their property. Therefore compensation for such property must be balanced against compensation payments Israel makes to Arab refugees. <pb xml:id="pg_459" n="459" facs="0487"/>He then asked specific question “what is attitude of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to this principle?”</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Boundaries and Security</hi>: He referred to paragraph II and said “if this security proposal were read alone I would have only greatest praise for it. But is bound up with settlement of main problems described”. He said he would not go any further in commenting on this point at this time but wished to underscore Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>’s critical statement in that regard to Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> (September 6) wherein he made reference to unsatisfactory linking of security guarantee with settlement of frontiers problem.<note n="3" xml:id="d267fn3">See <ref target="#d264">Document 264</ref>.</note> On face of it (he repeated “on face of it”) this contingency would seem to relegate settlement of Arab-Israel problem to dim future.</p>
                        <p>He said boundaries section of statement is full of obscurities, urged clarification be made to Israel. He asked: What is United States idea of armistice lines? Does US contemplate peace treaty involving permanent settlement of armistice lines? Or does US contemplate simple revision of armistice lines? If the latter then in his opinion settlement of armistice lines must be made under armistice agreement and must utilize machinery set up under that agreement for such purposes. Even then he remarked they would still remain armistice lines and not permanent international frontiers.</p>
                        <p>At this point he referred to phrase “convert armistice lines of danger into boundary lines of safety.” He said what does this mean? Does it mean they are not easily defensible and that purpose now is to establish more defensible lines? Or are new armistice lines designed to satisfy certain claims. He pointed out that Jordan-Israel line was relatively difficult one to defend. On other hand straight Gaza line was much more defensible line. Yet in first instance there was little difficulty between two countries on that line whereas in second instance there had been continuous incidents and troubles. Therefore in his opinion question does not rest on defensible character of line.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Territorial Changes</hi>: He then asked question “what territorial changes does US have in mind?” He referred to phrase “even territory which is barren has acquired sentimental significance.” He thought this obviously referred to Negev but wished to point [out] that Negev was not only “barren land” in this part of world. In fact much of Arab lands are barren but no one would suggest that Arabs abandon those lands or concede them to someone else. “Barrenness” does not justify giving up territory.</p>
                        <p>He then referred to Elath saying “certainly Elath is not area of sentimental value only. It has practical values. Its value as port is especially underscored at this time and Israel will never give up <pb xml:id="pg_460" n="460" facs="0488"/>Elath. There may be barrenness connecting Elath with other parts of Israel but they can certainly not be considered of ‘sentimental’ view of Elath’s very great practical value to Israel”.</p>
                        <p>He then referred to historical fact that Arab countries did not enjoy free connection across southern Negev “before war”. First it was Ottoman empire and then mandate territory. Therefore possession of Negev by Israel does not remove right formerly enjoyed by Arabs. In fact if Arab principle of presently demanding connections between Arab States on grounds such connections were destroyed by Israel is valid such principle might be more emphatically applied where Israel stands between Egypt and Lebanon.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Jerusalem Problem</hi>: He said I have only one question to ask under this heading “does US contemplate any initiative along this line at forthcoming <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Assembly?”</p>
                        <p>Speaking generally he said Israel has always stood ready for mutual adjustments of boundaries but has never been ready to consider cession of territory. We shall be ready to discuss first but shall be adamant about second. He then repeated rather forcefully “there is no question of concession of land by Israel.” He followed statement by question “what category of above adjustments to boundary is involved in US thinking?” He then asked question “what procedures with regard to revision of armistice lines are contemplated?” Does US envisage Arabs agreeing either to revision of armistice lines under armistice or revision through negotiation of peace treaty? If Arabs will not agree to either procedure will question of defense pact between US and Israel be put off indefinitely?</p>
                        <p>He said that generally boundaries question had aroused considerable apprehension in government. This apprehension was evident when Cabinet first hurriedly considered Secretary’s statement and later in subsequent discussions this same concern had been very evident. He remarked whatever US can do to allay this apprehension—either by public statement or by confidential message—would be helpful.</p>
                        <p>He then added what he termed “two footnotes”: He commented that figure 900,000 refugees was inaccurate and greatly inflated.</p>
                        <p>He picked up phrase in statement “in territory now occupied by Israel.” He thought it unfortunate phrase had appeared because it was not in conformity with general sense of statement which was that “Israel is here to stay.” By using phrase referred to Arabs might gain false hopes that US was not firmly of conviction Israel here to stay and at same time this phrase has raised certain resentment among Jews. He went on to enumerate certain actions and evidences which confirmed by implication that Israel was recognized as occupying and representing present territory. He said that as sovereign state, Israel had signed armistice agreement, had made treaties, had <pb xml:id="pg_461" n="461" facs="0489"/>diplomatic relations with other countries, was member of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and represented in sovereign way area now enclosed within its present boundaries. Therefore he thought that in place of this phrase there should have been simple reference to State of Israel. He thought that Secretary’s statement would lose great deal of its practical value through use of this unfortunate phrase.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: Sharrett obviously neither desired nor expected any attempt on my part to reply to his questions and comment. In view this and fact I had at time not received report on <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> talk I restricted my remarks to such generalizations as need for careful study, importance of keeping open mind and underscoring great opportunity statement presents to Israel. I indicated that replies to all of questions raised might require some discussion and might be delayed but we welcomed <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> close study and analysis of statement. I made no substantive comment on questions raised.

                        <p>442. Reference <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 401 and 402,<note n="2" xml:id="d268fn2">
                                <ref target="#d238">Documents 238</ref> and <ref target="#d239">239</ref>.</note> have following thoughts regarding future moves Alpha.</p>
                        <p>(1) Arab States either individually or collectively should be discouraged from ever taking public position on Secretary’s speech. We should return now to highly secret discussions as soon as possible.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_462" n="462" facs="0490"/>
                        <p>(2) Arab-Israeli settlement can most probably never be achieved by treating matter in isolation from other matters in Middle East. If subject isolated settlement takes on too much character of final registration of “defeat” for Arabs by Israel. Matter must therefore be included in over-all package deal of some kind. Of primary importance in this regard will be (a) U.S. policy for Middle East as a whole and (b) use of U.S. economic and military aid resources. Department may wish to refer this connection <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss>s 440 and 441<note n="3" xml:id="d268fn3">Neither printed.</note> which admittedly speculative but probably indicative of sweeping nature of over-all deal that will be required as regards (a) above. Since manipulation U.S. policy and resources such a cardinal factor, believe profitable utilization of “suitable person or commission designated by United Nations or by any government or person agreed upon by both sides” as mentioned <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 401 probably should be ruled out for time being.</p>
                        <p>(3) If Egypt is to take desired lead there must be some overt recognition on part of U.S. of Egypt’s position in Middle East. This probably most effectively accomplished through some manipulation our present concept of Middle East defense.</p>
                        <p>(4) While this philosophy subject to change we would not adopt traditional British approach in this part of world of “little steps for little people” but would rather move forward without delay or quid pro quo in certain fields as form of approach may cause us never to get off the ground to real start. In this connection and without minimizing difficulty for Department would recommend earliest possible action on sale of some military equipment to Egypt. Believe from talks with Jackson, Israel may be aware that increased cooperation and better relations between Egypt and U.S. is prerequisite to real progress on Alpha. The sale of some equipment would not in my opinion reduce our bargaining power but in fact enhance it in view of importance of military here. Even ignoring [garble] importance of moving forward in this field as contained recent cables this Embassy has not diminished in my mind and believe we should proceed if at all possible without hesitation.</p>
                        <p>(5) Following same philosophy it seems to me Department may wish reconsider that invitation to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> visit U.S. on basis recommended by this Embassy should be held up as quid pro quo for proper attitude on Alpha.<note n="4" xml:id="d268fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> reported on September 1 that <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> had raised the question of <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s visiting the United States. See <ref target="#d250">Document 250</ref>.</note> Position of U.S. and this Embassy has improved considerably in past two or three months and particularly in view of our recent help during Gaza troubles. My own feeling is now is time to push forward wherever we can set best possible stage <pb xml:id="pg_463" n="463" facs="0491"/>for Alpha—which is project of much importance probably cannot be attained without some risk and without criticism in some quarters.</p>
                        <p>(6) Feel Nasser will have difficulty with Trieste approach at least in early stages and that matter better be handled with him direct with such assist as we can get from <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName>. In this connection there seems to be an inclination on part <persName corresp="#p_TSH1">Trevelyan</persName> (although he does not insist) as with <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Stevenson</persName> to want to work towards actual joint and simultaneous conversations with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>. Have told <persName corresp="#p_TSH1">Trevelyan</persName> my opinion mechanics of this most difficult and do not see how it could be done without causing great speculation as to subject matter such joint démarches. Feel it far better as matter of principle we work towards same ends separately. Have feeling British Foreign Office may not like this but hope Department will agree that we should avoid such approaches here on local level as long as possible after which time Department might wish to take up matter with Foreign Office. Am thinking somewhat of our experience on Iranian problem when that problem in early stages. If we ever get to actual drafting stage perhaps such an arrangement might work.</p>

                        <p>448. For <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName>. Have not reported to any extent on activities of Elmore Jackson as Tel Aviv’s cables gave good picture of his efforts. Nevertheless, wish Department to know feel he has made considerable contribution, and as such is an exception to my general thinking that individuals privately operating in such capacity usually do more harm than good. Am certain he was helpful in keeping things from getting out of hand on crisis on border week before last. Also feel from long range point of view he may have been able re-establish some small degree of mutual confidence between <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> and Sharrett which unfortunately has apparently been completely lacking.</p>

                        <p>While precise nature of committee’s recommendations is unknown, I have reason believe it plans suggest to Foreign Ministers that last attempt be made to obtain (1) Yarmuk Dam foundation capable of supporting future increase in dam height, (2) larger overall allocation water, and (3) elimination provision permitting Israel supply 30 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">MCM</gloss> of water to <gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> at above Lake Tiberias salinity. However, committee not believed to be recommending insistence on any issue to point of rejection with possible exception of 30 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">MCM</gloss> brackish water. If this correct, decision on program as whole will be squarely up to Foreign Ministers.</p>
                        <p>Most serious current problem continues to be secure meeting Foreign Ministers in face lack of Syrian Government and resignation Lebanese Foreign Minister.<note n="3" xml:id="d271fn3">Frangie resigned from the government on September 7.</note> Although <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> almost certain to depart for New York prior any date meeting can be held, I am continuing press for meeting with other Ministers and <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName>’s Deputy<note n="4" xml:id="d271fn4">Ahmad Kheirat Said.</note> at earliest feasible date.

In his statement Secretary wished <pb xml:id="pg_467" n="467" facs="0495"/>indicate desirability working toward settlement principal issues and to set forth what this country is prepared contribute to facilitate such settlement. The expressed willingness of Arab Govts to study Secretary’s statement encourages us believe they will in near future discuss with us some of problems arising in connection with a settlement. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> hopes leaders of both Israel and Arab states will continue give this matter intensive study to the end that parties will at early date be prepared indicate concessions and contributions each can make toward settlement. If both sides or indeed either side should take position unable make any, it obvious no progress possible. We feel however that reception Secretary’s statement creates opportunities for progress. If a period of calm can be maintained in area, we hope obtain views of several of Arab govts as to form and elements of settlement to which they would agree. We also look forward to receiving Israel’s thoughts concerning what it prepared to do. We feel it in interest all concerned that such steps take place with minimum publicity. US willing, if both sides desire, assist— with <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> presumably in view its relations in area—in initiating exchange of views between parties.</p>

                        <p>461. <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> and I discussed at length yesterday combined subject of Alpha and Secretary’s speech. He said in his opinion speech was being considered in sober fashion in Arab world, even though we might disagree on various points. (While there have been some fairly jarring editorials and cartoons, am inclined to agree with him that press criticism could be labeled “moderate”, all things considered.) He agreed that it would be unwise for the Arabs collectively to formally and publicly answer speech. He agreed it was far better that matter be kept under consideration and followed up by secret discussions.</p>
                        <p>As to substance, he felt it was time to have further discussions provided they could be in utmost informality and that number of persons involved be as small as possible. He made point however that talks should be held in Tel Aviv as well as Cairo. Queried him considerably on this point as we had agreed several months ago best approach was for US and Egypt try to reach general meeting of minds prior to approaching Israelis. He said he thought that had been good start but it probably time now see what Israelis had in mind and we had discussed substance enough to know that there probably no insurmountable obstacle between our views except as regards Negev. Egypt could hardly be expected to bargain away her position without every conceivable effort being made to change Israeli’s position, as well as that of Egypt, on Negev.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> reiterated most adamantly that they would never accept corridor type arrangement and there must become actual transfer of defensible territory to establish continuity of Arab world. Told him again it inconceivable to me that any Israeli Government could come even near to meeting Egyptian position of all of Negev. He admitted he believed this probably true. Therefore real effort should be made to see how much gap could be narrowed between present positions. If gap could not be substantially narrowed then he supposed we would all have to conclude settlement impossible. On other hand if gap could be made small enough, perhaps then it could be cut in half by efforts of outsiders and a solution could be arrived at which neither would readily accept but which they could both acquiesce in.</p>
                        <p>In answer to query, <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> stated he believed matter should be kept in normal diplomatic channels at this stage and as secret as <pb xml:id="pg_469" n="469" facs="0497"/>possible. Stated British Ambassador<note n="2" xml:id="d274fn2">Sir <persName corresp="#p_TSH1">Humphrey Trevelyan</persName>.</note> had asked his view as to whether US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> should make joint approaches in Cairo and Tel Aviv. <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> said he had told <persName corresp="#p_TSH1">Trevelyan</persName> he thought formalities of joint approach highly undesirable at this stage. (<persName corresp="#p_TSH1">Trevelyan</persName> later confirmed this to me and stated he thought <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> probably correct.)</p>
                        <p>Believe this conversation calls for alteration past Alpha procedure and <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> probably right that next move should be with Israel. He said Egypt could hardly play role we envisaged unless it could be convinced what it would consider as minimum position could be substantially met. Only then could it be expected to take leadership on Arab side and stick out its neck on this problem. Am encouraged somewhat also that this the first hint there could be some concession on Negev, but not in continued one-sided discussions. Under circumstances doubt there much more that we can do here by merely expressing our view as to Israeli attitudes.</p>
                        <p>If Department decides take matter up with Israel without delay, would think it most unfortunate that cross-triangle solution be suggested to them, as do not conceive this particular solution would ever be accepted here. Would suggest our approach be a general one stressing utmost importance from their own point of view finding solution to Negev problem with statement that we do not believe Arabs will accept a corridor. Perhaps it would be wise to seek Israeli’s reactions on Negev in context of general review with them of important elements entire Alpha plan.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> stated we must remember there no significant body of opinion in Arab world seeking immediate settlement. Almost everyone was of two minds about problem. There was general feeling that time was essentially now on the side of the Arabs and many people believe that there should be delay until such time as the Arabs could negotiate from a better basis of strength. He himself had feeling that if real progress could not be made in next few months, Arab attitude might well harden for such delay. He wished stress he was not talking about eventual use of force but the psychology of wishing to negotiate from position of greater strength.</p>
                        <p>Department may wish consider passing this message Tel Aviv.</p>

However <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s reaction both subjects indicated he willing consider them but required a period of quiet on border prior to any decision.</p>
                        <p>For your information Jackson informed <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> he felt he had begun in last contact with <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> to win latter’s confidence and consequently had been able impress upon him restraint which <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had exercised in latter sieges [<hi rend="italic">stages</hi>?] Gaza fracas.

Your talks with <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> have helped clarify possible steps to relate them in concrete terms. Our policies in support of northern tier have been set forth both publicly and privately to various govts (e.g., <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 107<note n="3" xml:id="d276fn3">See <ref target="#d174fn3">footnote 3, Document 174</ref>.</note>). We cannot change these policies. Pakistan’s adherence to Baghdad Pact expected momentarily. We would welcome adherence Iran but believe this unlikely occur near future. While we do not envisage adherence additional Arab states at this time, we could not assist in any program which would isolate Iraq from rest of Arab states. Also we could not give our support to grouping involving states bordering on Israel in absence substantial progress toward Arab-Israel settlement. However, can envisage rear area grouping complementing and supporting, not rivaling, northern tier and not precluding eventual adherence other Arab states to Baghdad Pact. This underscores importance movement on Alpha.</p>
                        <p>We have been exploring possibilities assisting <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> finance arms purchases and find severe practical difficulties irrespective policy considerations. Acceptance local currency in magnitude $10 million apparently would require programming current econ assistance funds so as create requirement this amount of pounds. In effect Egypt would lose in econ assistance dollars what it gains in military assistance dollars. We see no prospects for other immediate large-scale requirement for pounds. Extension of credit under Section 106<note n="4" xml:id="d276fn4">Reference is to Section 106 of the Mutual Security Act of 1954.</note> requires use of service funds and would involve repayment in dollars with interest. We recognize disadvantages delaying answer to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> for protracted period.

                        <p>1. Response Arab states in studying Secretary’s proposals carefully has been gratifying. We not asking public statements applauding proposals but only indication Arab govts prepared explore possibility progressing along lines outlined by Secretary.</p>
                        <p>2. Response Arab states generally affords Egypt best opportunity exert leadership among Arab states. We hope <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> will take initiative which they appear ready permit Egypt take. Otherwise leadership might fall to other hands. We do not mean Egypt should negotiate for all Arab states but should take initiative to extent of exploring problems directly affecting Egypt. Once Egypt has set course (as in case armistice agreements) other Arab states might be expected follow similar path.</p>
                        <p>3. We agree discussions should be conducted in secret and through normal diplomatic channels.</p>

Conversation, of which full account being pouched to British Embassy Washington, did not reveal anything particularly new. Israel Ambassador first raised questions of Egyptian restrictions on shipping in Gulf of Aqaba and supply of arms to Iraq. Ambassador then touched on Secretary’s statement regarding Israel-Arab settlement alleging it was unfair to make security guarantee conditional upon settlement. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> remarked <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> fully supports views of United States <pb xml:id="pg_475" n="475" facs="0503"/>Government on this point. Ambassador mentioned refugee problem and said Israel Government encouraged by apparent recognition by Secretary that resettlement was key to problem. Here <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> reminded Ambassador that Secretary had referred to “resettlement, and to such an extent as may be feasible, repatriation”. On boundaries, Ambassador took line Israel unable to make any concessions, to which <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> observed that both sides would have to make concessions if settlement to be achieved.</p>

                                <ref target="#d276">Document 276</ref>.</note> that considerable misunderstanding has arisen <pb xml:id="pg_476" n="476" facs="0504"/>between this Embassy and Department. Will review our recent cables to see if we can possibly make our views more clear.</p>

                        <p>Unless Department decides ignore Egypt’s recommendation that Alpha now be discussed with Israel, ball is no longer in our court here.

                        <p>
                            <persName>Burns</persName> spent some hours with Gohar discussing implementation Security Council resolution of September 8.<note n="2" xml:id="d281fn2">For a summary of the resolution, see <ref target="#d262">Document 262</ref>.</note> Gohar said Egyptians willing withdraw their forces from frontier thus creating neutral zone, provided Israelis did same. However he maintains opposition to erection physical barrier along demarcation line. Egypt might agree to establishment barbed-wire fences to limited extent in certain strategic places but continuous barrier was out of question. In view Gohar’s consistently negative attitude this matter <persName>Burns</persName> addressed letter to Egyptian Minister of War pointing out that proposals <pb xml:id="pg_477" n="477" facs="0505"/>must be accepted as whole in order comply with resolution. (He left copy this letter with Embassy Cairo.)<note n="3" xml:id="d281fn3">The Embassy in Cairo transmitted its summary of <persName>Burns</persName>’ conversation with Gohar to the Department in telegram 490, September 17, not printed. (Department of State, Central Files, 674.84a/9–1755) The Embassy also sent the Department the text of <persName>Burns</persName>’ letter of September 15 to the Egyptian Minister of War under cover of despatch 325, September 20, not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 674.84A/9–2055)</note>
                            <persName>Burns</persName> described Gohar as almost completely useless as representative for such discussions and expressed regret his continued connection with subject.</p>
                        <p>Owing Jewish holidays <persName>Burns</persName> has not yet taken up question September 8 resolution with Israelis but intends do so early next week. He anticipates they will firmly oppose proposal for withdrawal motorized patrols from immediate vicinity <gloss target="#t_DL1">DL</gloss>. However he considers it barely possible they might consent do so in unlikely event Egyptians accept barrier. <persName>Burns</persName> has concluded that only <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> is in position face up to decision regarding latter. He was therefore thinking of requesting appointment see <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> in near future.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Burns</persName> discussed with Gohar dangers implicit in maintaining Palestinian soldiers in forward positions Gaza strip (<gloss target="#t_Contel1">Contel</gloss> 83<note n="4" xml:id="d281fn4">Not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 674.84A/9–955)</note>). Gohar merely counters with some nonsensical argument to effect that while these soldiers are indeed Palestinians “a soldier obeys orders regardless of his place of origin.” In voicing his disagreement with foregoing thesis, <persName>Burns</persName> said he pointed out to Gohar that should further incidents occur through lack effective Egyptian control of troops Israeli retaliation would be most likely. He did not plan to be issuing a warning, but merely expressing a fact.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Burns</persName> said that so far as he is aware Egyptians had never withdrawn Palestinian troops from area. However their officers including non-commissioned officers are Egyptians. Palestinian soldiers are evidently considered as regular troops “trained and disciplined.” Consequently present situation with respect this point does not to his knowledge represent deterioration from earlier practice. In <persName>Burns</persName>’ opinion decision to send “suicide squads” into Israel was taken by Egyptians primarily as means retaliation for Israeli attack on Egyptian position August 22.</p>
                        <p>To sum up situation as to this date <persName>Burns</persName> evidently made no progress at Cairo unless of course his letter to Minister of War should evoke more favorable response than is now to be anticipated. Moreover he is not optimistic regarding attitude either party toward Security Council resolution. He expressed opinion parties will remain indifferent to resolution unless great powers can exert some efficacious form of pressure or persuasion. If they cannot he foresees <pb xml:id="pg_478" n="478" facs="0506"/>renewal of cycle of incidents and reprisals as most probable development.</p>

                        <p>492. From <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>. In discussion with <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> Deputy Foreign Minister Said, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName>, Mohammed Selim and Ahmad Farag just prior <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName>’s departure for US we explored technical aspects Jordan Valley program and factors bearing on timing Foreign Minister meeting, procedure and documentation.</p>
                        <p>Discussion opened on technical questions. Selim asked for and received clarifications on following points: (1) Whether <gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> can build higher dam. We repeated arguments against dam impounding more than 300 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">MCM</gloss> but said no objection Arabs increasing its height so long as they finance, (2) Arab objection to inclusion 30 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">MCM</gloss> saline water in <gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> allotment from Jordan River. We expressed willingness try work out compromise proposal, (3) financing hydroelectric installations Yarmuk dam. We reiterated power installations bankable and hence not eligible US grant aid, but indicated US willing provide good offices in connection loan application to appropriate banking institutions, (4) authority of neutral supervisory body. Selim at first insisted neutral supervision should be limited to facilities having international effect. When it pointed out this might preclude access of supervisory body to Israel diversion at Jisr Banat Yaqub, Selim indicated merely that supervision should not extend to ground, Wadi and other local water resources, (5) inclusion Hasbani development in program. We confirmed offer to conduct survey on Hasbani River and assist in financing through <gloss target="#t_UNRRA1">UNRRA</gloss> sound irrigation project based on availability 35 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">MCM</gloss> allotted to Lebanon.</p>
                        <p>In discussing timing, <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> pointed out Farhan at present Istanbul. Selim scheduled go London and Paris until September 28 and serious question whether Lebanon will be in position send Foreign <pb xml:id="pg_479" n="479" facs="0507"/>Minister to meeting prior end this month. We discussed possibility meeting September 24, but I reluctantly agreed to October 1 when <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> strongly urged setting it back rather than attempt earlier date with serious risk postponement.</p>
                        <p>We next discussed procedure: How and by whom meeting should be called, participation and relationship meeting to League. <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> began on assumption program was already in hands Arab League through its Technical Committee. When I pressed view it not Arab League affair, <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> appeared primarily concerned because his inability find rationale for Egypt’s participation outside framework Arab League. He contended that in final stage of political consideration Egypt had no more basis for participation than Iraq, and that matter was therefore one for either three riparian nations or full Arab League. We continued press case with <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName> supporting our position until <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> suggested we await arrival Arab League Secretary General Hassouna who had next appointment with him.</p>
                        <p>In reviewing problem with Hassouna we emphasized inappropriateness my seeking approval Arab League on political level when program had been carefully removed from political sphere and pointed out necessity deal with States concerned on project basis. On other hand we made explicit our lack any objection if States concerned wish seek Arab League approval after conclusion negotiations with US.

However Foreign Ministers clearly feel obliged submit Jordan valley program to Council for final concurrence. While I cannot evaluate complex political forces which may bear on Council consideration of program, wish set forth following observations for comment and suggestions.</p>
                        <p>Assuming continued Egyptian cooperation, Saudi Arabia unlikely create serious difficulties and neither Libya nor Yemen expected play active role. Iraq however could cause trouble.</p>

Iraq–Egypt struggle for Council leadership could conceivably result in tactical Iraqi opposition Jordan valley plan because of role Egypt has played.

                        <p>Iraq may oppose plan in attempt demonstrate that Iraq’s uncompromising anti-Israel stand not modified as result military orientation toward West. If this possibility appears to develop Embassy Baghdad may find means encourage Iraq maintain earlier disposition to stay out of problem and let states concerned decide. In this connection <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName>’s desire avoid any step re plan which might be provocative to Iraq (see reference telegram) is of interest.</p>

                        <p>On basis limited information available to me it would appear unwise for Embassy Baghdad, myself or member my staff engage in substantive discussion Jordan valley plan with Iraqi officials as it might stir up interest that unlikely be constructive. However if Embassy believes it necessary to have detailed discussion I might be able send Troxel Baghdad for discreet consultation Embassy personnel.</p>

                        <p>At 11:30 a.m. on September 20, Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> met with Soviet Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>, Soviet Ambassador Zaroubin, and Soviet Interpreter Troyanovski at the Secretary’s suite at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York to review a number of matters, among them being the question of possible Soviet armaments shipments to Arab nations. According to the memorandum of conversation, the following was said on this issue:</p>
                        <p> “The Secretary said there was one matter which he would like to raise. The United States Government had received recurrent reports, although it could not be sure of their accuracy, of possible large armament grants to Arab countries. He said that he should not conceal the fact that if these reports were true, this action would be a disturbing element at a time when the US is trying to keep a balance between the Israelis and the Arabs. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> replied that such questions might be discussed on the normal commercial plane, but such conversations should not cause misunderstanding. In any case, he said the matter is not being approached on political grounds but rather on a commercial basis. The Secretary said there might be political repercussions if there were to be a change in the present balance of power in that area—there would be great potential danger if either side thought it was strong enough to undertake successful aggressive action—then you might have a war in which it would be difficult for the US to be completely disinterested. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> said that the Soviet Union approaches questions in that area only on the basis of its relations to the countries there—there is no complication of the situation in the area—at least that is the assumption of the Soviet government.” (Department of State, Central Files, 611.61/ 9–2055)</p>

                        <p>Irrespective of what I may be allowed tell <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>, I find it impossible understand why I have not been informed of Department’s reasoning in turning down repeated and increasingly urgent recommendations that we make financial arrangement which would permit Egypt take advantage our offer (in response its request) sell arms. Follow-up comments referred <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> not yet received but to this Embassy it is crystal clear that by our unwillingness manipulate a few million dollars we are permitting situation deteriorate to point where chain reaction of nature that will constitute a major defeat for US policy in Middle East, as contrasted to that of Soviet bloc, is highly probable. Either we have been unable to adequately communicate this conviction or Department and other interested agencies are operating on an assessment or premises which are radically different from ours and which have not been communicated to us here.</p>
                        <p>While Department must decide over-all policy it seems to me that due weight should be given recommendations Embassy as to best tactics to obtain atmosphere under which these policies may succeed. If we are wincing under what may appear to be blackmail, I would remind Department again that this situation did not arise from <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s initiative but by Russian initiative capitalizing upon <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s need for continued support of his army in situation that has followed events since initial February 28 attack by Israel at Gaza. If on other hand our inability meet requirements of present situation is due to belief that quid pro quo can be increased by continued delay, we are making very great mistake.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Next Steps</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> suggested that the meeting should begin by discussing the next steps. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>’s statement had been received as well as we could possibly have expected in the countries concerned: no government was publicly committed against it. We knew that the Israelis were willing to talk to us about a settlement; and the Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs had stated his position in general terms, and whilst emphasising that we must next sound out the attitude of the Israeli Government, he had given us to understand that we were at liberty to put our more specific ideas to Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> and him whenever we wished. We had thus made a start, and we must proceed as quickly as possible. He would be suggesting that after assuring ourselves that Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> was fully behind what his Foreign Minister had said to us, we should next approach the Israelis. We should explain to them that the Egyptians were ready to discuss the possibility of a settlement but had put a high price—the whole of the Negev—on their readiness. We could then try to elicit some kind of counter-offer from the Israelis.</p>
                        <p>2. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> said that he took a rather less optimistic view of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName>’s talks to our Ambassadors in Cairo. Our first objective must be to find some Arab country, which we thought would have to be Egypt, to take the lead in moving towards a settlement. It looked as though Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> was simply trying to postpone the day when Egypt would have to make that move by transferring the onus of starting concrete negotiations to the Israelis. We must first get the Egyptian Government to say definitely that they were prepared to exchange ideas, directly or indirectly, with the Israelis with a view to reaching a settlement. The Egyptians had not yet gone as far as this.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_486" n="486" facs="0514"/>
                        <p>3. Meanwhile, the Israelis were trying to dislodge the United States Government from the position that a settlement must precede a guarantee. Their latest proposal was that the United States should announce that they would give the guarantee either at the end of a fixed period, or as soon as it became clear that the Arabs would not cooperate in the achievement of a settlement. They were also trying to find out what kind of settlement the United States Government had in mind. In order to keep them at arm’s length whilst we tried to bring the Egyptians to the point, he suggested that we should now formulate a set of questions through which we could seek the views of both sides on certain specific questions, such as the magnitude and method of distribution of compensation. This would engage the Israelis’ attention for some time; and meanwhile we might be able to get Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> to designate some person or body to exchange views with the Israelis through an intermediary. Only then should we be certain that the Egyptians were willing to negotiate without pre-conditions.</p>
                        <p>4. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> suggested that our tactics depended on whether we regarded the Negev difficulty as being in a different category from the other elements of a settlement. The Egyptian Foreign Minister had given us the impression that the other issues were capable of solution, but he had emphasised the Egyptian determination to secure the Negev. It was unlikely that we should be able to make any further progress with the Egyptians until we could show them some counter-proposal on the Negev. There was much to be said for tackling this problem first. Our past experience indicated that Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> would simply refuse to discuss other problems until he was convinced that he would get some satisfaction on the Negev; and there was little else that we could discuss with the Egyptians without bringing in other Arab states. Until we felt fairly certain that agreement on the Negev was possible, we should be unwise to show our hand on other matters. In the end everything would turn on a solution for the Negev; and if we failed on that, our other proposals, by then known to all the parties, would collapse and be discredited. By starting with the Negev we could keep these intact.</p>
                        <p>5. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> agreed that the Negev was the most difficult problem. If we tried to deal with it at the beginning, we should find it very hard to make any progress. The Israelis felt that they had little room to manoeuvre: there were few things on which they could make concessions, and they would not make so important a sacrifice until right at the end of negotiations. They might possibly accept our idea of triangles as a final concession to clinch agreement, but they would need to be sure that they would get a settlement before they abandoned their present position on the Negev. The <pb xml:id="pg_487" n="487" facs="0515"/>same consideration might weigh with the Egyptians also: if we could get negotiations started and create an atmosphere of progress on other issues, we might in the end be able to induce both the Egyptians and the Israelis to give up their dreams of possessing the whole of the Negev. But we could not expect to do so immediately. Before approaching the Israelis we must get <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> to accept the idea of negotiations unconditionally.</p>
                        <p>6. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> remarked that from the Egyptian point of view the idea of moving towards a settlement with Israel was the first concession. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> would be reluctant to make it unless he received something in return, that is to say an assurance that Israel would be ready to make some concession on the Negev during the negotiations. Only if we could show him that he would get something out of Israel could we expect to move him from that position.</p>
                        <p>7. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> said that it seemed that what Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> most wanted was arms supplies. But he could not pay; and it might be possible for the United States to give him a long-term credit if he was ready to commit himself formally to negotiations with Israel through an intermediary. By this means <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> would be able to safeguard his internal position, and we should have obtained from him the starting point for the Alpha negotiations.</p>
                        <p>8. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> said that he did not like the idea of offering arms to the Egyptians at the present time. Since Egypt was not cooperating with us over defence matters, the normal justification for the offer would be lacking; and it would look as though we were rewarding <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> for an agreement to betray the whole Arab position over Palestine. However, we must certainly try to move <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> from the position that the acquisition of the Negev was a <hi rend="italic">condition</hi> for negotiations at least to the point at which his claim would appear as <hi rend="italic">part of</hi> negotiations which he had already accepted in principle. Putting the matter simply and bluntly, it seemed that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName>’s idea was to induce <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> to make that move by the prospect of arms supplies; whilst his (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName>’s) idea amounted to a proposal that we should first get some concession out of the Israelis and use that as the lever to shift <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>.</p>
                        <p>9. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> said that the State Department had not arrived at the idea of an arms offer as a result of a search for an appropriate inducement. It was rather that they were being pressed to help <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> with arms in any case; and they did not wish to do so unless they got something more concrete from him on Alpha.</p>
                        <p>10. In discussion, it <hi rend="italic">was recognised</hi> that the difficulty was that neither the Egyptians nor the Israelis were prepared to be first in the field with concessions. The situation resembled an oriental bazaar bargain in which neither vendor nor purchaser would name the starting price. We should have to point out to both sides that they <pb xml:id="pg_488" n="488" facs="0516"/>had taken positions over the Negev that made any kind of negotiation for a settlement impossible. The only way out of this deadlock was to induce both sides to admit that the Negev was a subject for discussion: each side should receive and give an assurance on this point.</p>
                        <p>11. <hi rend="italic">It was agreed</hi> that we should seek <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s agreement to an agenda for negotiations which contained among the other elements of a settlement the Egyptian claim for a land link with Jordan across the Negev. We should ask him whether he was prepared to start discussions on condition that the Israelis accepted this agenda. If so, we would try to get the Israelis to accept it.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Inducements to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        </p>
                        <p>12. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> wondered what we should do if <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> refused to accept the idea of proceeding through an agreed agenda. With regard to the possibility of offering material inducements, he explained that the offer of arms, to which he had referred before, had not in the first place been connected with Alpha. It had been proposed quite independently as a means of strengthening <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s position. The State Department’s idea was not to use arms as a bribe in connection with Alpha, but simply to delay an offer which was being considered on other grounds until <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> was ready to make a move on Alpha.</p>
                        <p>13. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> agreed that the offer of arms to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> was premature. The mere acceptance of the agenda would not be sufficient to justify it: such an offer should only be made in return for real progress in the Alpha negotiations. In any case it was open to the following objections:</p>
                        <p>(a) It would mean that the West was aiding a country which was not cooperating in defence matters.</p>
                        <p>(b) The Egyptians were already doing well over arms: they had already obtained the release of 32 Centurions from the United Kingdom, and they had asked for a further 32 which we could not let them have.</p>
                        <p>(c) It was doubtful whether an offer of arms would make any difference to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s attitude at this stage.</p>
                        <p>14. <hi rend="italic">It was agreed</hi> that we should not offer <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> arms in the mere hope that he would thereafter cooperate on Alpha. We should require evidence of real progress.</p>
                        <p>15. Turning to political inducements, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> had pointed out that Egypt’s rôle on Alpha could not be divorced from the general policy of the United States Government in the Middle East. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName>’s view was that we should relax our efforts to seek new members for the Turco-Iraqi Pact and encourage Egypt to take the lead in the formation of an Arab pact which <pb xml:id="pg_489" n="489" facs="0517"/>would fit into the “defence in depth” of the Middle East. He thought that if the Egyptians saw that this was Western policy, they would be ready to cooperate on Alpha. The State Department intended to explain to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> that the Northern Tier concept, which they supported, must be promoted, though they were not making any effort to get additional Arab members for the Turco-Iraqi Pact now. They hoped that some rôle might be found for Egypt in the defence of the area, but they could not agree to abandon their support of the Turco-Iraqi Pact merely in order to allow Egypt to recover her leadership.</p>
                        <p>16. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> said that he was glad to hear that the State Department agreed that we should not say anything to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> which was inconsistent with the support of the United States and the United Kingdom for the Turco-Iraqi Pact.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. Mechanics of Negotiation</p>
                        <p>17. <hi rend="italic">It was recognized</hi> that when we presented the agenda to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> we might also have to give him some indication of our ideas on the methods of negotiation. It was likely that he would demand complete secrecy: he would not wish the other Arab states, particularly Iraq, to know that he was entering on negotiations with Israel. Another difficulty was that the Egyptian Foreign Minister had told us that he did not want joint Anglo-American approaches: we must put our ideas to him separately.</p>
                        <p>18. In discussion the following points <hi rend="italic">were agreed</hi>:</p>
                        <p>(a) Up to the stage at which the agenda was agreed we could maintain complete secrecy: we should work through our representatives in Cairo and Tel Aviv.</p>
                        <p>(b) Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> had insisted on dealing with either the United Kingdom or the United States Ambassador alone. The lead should be taken by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName>, who would of course keep Sir <persName corresp="#p_TSH1">H. Trevelyan</persName> fully informed.</p>
                        <p>(c) In Israel joint approaches would probably be best: the Israelis must know that we were in full agreement.</p>
                        <p>(d) In Jordan and Iraq H.M. Representatives would take the lead when the time came.</p>
                        <p>(e) Once the agenda had been agreed and negotiations on matters which were of concern to the other Arab states were ready to start, we should have to bring in Jordan at least. We could not discuss Jordan’s interests behind her back.</p>
                        <p>(f) We should discuss the best means of bringing other Arab states in with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>. We could counter his objections by explaining that this would spread the burden of negotiations. We hoped Egypt would take the lead, but we were not asking her to accept the responsibility of negotiating alone those parts of a settlement which touched other parties.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_490" n="490" facs="0518"/>
                        <p>19. <hi rend="italic">It was agreed</hi> that once the agenda had been accepted we should not long be able to carry on negotiations through our representatives in the Middle East. It would indeed be easier to avoid the appearance of breakdowns that way; but the best hope of reconciling the positions of the parties, as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>’s negotiations showed, was to have a person or group who could talk to both sides. We could not conduct the early stages of the negotiations with the plenipotentiaries of all the parties in London and Washington: where important matters of principle were concerned, the Arab representatives would neither enjoy the full confidence of their Governments nor have the authority or the courage to make any concessions. We must get at the leaders who would have to take the decisions. But once the main lines of a settlement had been agreed, negotiations on matters of detail could most conveniently be conducted with representatives of both sides in London or Washington.</p>
                        <p>20. <hi rend="italic">It was recognized</hi> that the employment of mediators would involve publicity, and by arousing excitement defeat its own ends, and perhaps expose us to the charge of usurping the functions of the United Nations. We should not take up a rigid position on that yet, but await developments and arrange mediation ad hoc at first. For example, after the acceptance of the agenda and the preliminary exchange of views, British and American representatives might make a tour of the Middle Eastern capitals for some other ostensible purpose and start the reconciliation process: if the Governments concerned wanted secrecy it could easily be maintained at any rate for one such visit. As regards the United Nations, we should do well to keep the Secretary General (who had supported Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>’s statement) informed of our progress.</p>
                        <p>21. <hi rend="italic">It was agreed</hi> therefore that the negotiations would fall into three main stages:</p>
                        <p>(a) Up to the acceptance of the agenda and the preliminary exchanges of views: to be conducted through H.M. and U.S. Representatives in the countries concerned.</p>
                        <p>(b) The attempt to reconcile the views of the parties and secure agreement on broad principles: special representatives of the Foreign Office and State Department would visit the Middle East and talk to both sides.</p>
                        <p>(c) Negotiation of details: the parties would designate representatives to meet negotiators from the Foreign Office and State Department, either in London or Washington or in some other suitable capital.</p>
                        <p>22. <hi rend="italic">It was agreed</hi> that if real progress could be made and a settlement seemed possible, we should recommend to our Secretaries of State that they should consider taking a personal share in the final negotiations in order to clinch the agreement. If they saw Dr.<persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName>
                            <pb xml:id="pg_491" n="491" facs="0519"/>and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> in New York during the present session of the Assembly, it would help if they showed a strong personal interest in Alpha and urged the two Ministers in the direction we want them to take. But the real decision in Egypt would lie with Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>, and in Israel probably with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">D. Interim Dealings With the Israelis</p>
                        <p>23. <hi rend="italic">It was recognized</hi> that we must soon expect further questions, and perhaps some specific proposals from the Israelis. As it might take some time to bring the Egyptians to the point, we should have to be prepared to make some non-committal response to Israeli initiatives.</p>
                        <p>24. <hi rend="italic">It was agreed</hi> that we should say that we had so far received no response from the Arabs: our offers to help in finding a solution were dependent on the request of both sides. The Israelis must be patient, for it was encouraging that for the first time the Arabs had not rejected the idea of a settlement out of hand. Meanwhile, we were quite ready to listen to their views on the refugees, which was the least contentious yet the most complicated part of a settlement.</p>

In event of chain reaction resulting from <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> acceptance of Russian proposal (Emb’s 509) it might prove desirable for us to join Pact promptly, bringing with us as many Arab States as possible.

                        <p>518. Late last night we were told by highly reliable source that Egypt’s arms deal with Russia was now definitely decided. Informant interrupted by entrance additional persons into conversation before full story could be obtained. Not certain as to exact quantities but mentioned 200 MIGs, 100 tanks, and “U” boats. All deliveries to be made within 3 months. Russian technicians would be admitted to Egypt to assist in assembling but it would be stipulated they would stay no longer than 3 months. No public announcement was to be made but rather series of editorials would start today justifying fact that Egypt should no longer wait on West but accept Russia offer.</p>
                        <p>Such editorials, one of them full page, did in fact start this morning. Story thus hangs together so well and conforms so closely <pb xml:id="pg_493" n="493" facs="0521"/>with reports from other sources there no doubt in my mind Executive decision made although there is reason to believe decision may not have actually been passed to Soviets.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> said that the Foreign Office had received a telegram from H.M. Ambassador in Cairo, who had seen <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> on September 20.<note n="2" xml:id="d291fn2">No copy of this telegram has been found in Department of State files.</note> It was unfortunately evident that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> was not behind what <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> had said to our Ambassadors. He had told Sir <persName corresp="#p_TSH1">H. Trevelyan</persName> that Egyptian public opinion and his own thinking was dominated by fear of Israeli expansion and a feeling of insecurity. The present was therefore no time for a Palestine settlement. When Sir <persName corresp="#p_TSH1">H. Trevelyan</persName> had pointed out that the way to remove the feeling of fear and insecurity was through a settlement, <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had changed his ground and said that he feared that the other Arab states would conduct a political attack on Egypt if she took the lead towards a settlement: he feared such attacks on account of Egyptian leadership on the <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> plan. Even if this went well, he thought that a settlement now was impossible and emphasised the great strategic importance of the Negev to Egypt. He did not favour an approach to Israel by us at this stage, but he would be prepared to listen to our more detailed ideas on the strict understanding that the conversations would remain entirely confidential and not come to the ears of other Arab states.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_494" n="494" facs="0522"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> considered that it would be unwise to allow <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s statements to stand for long without comment. He thought that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> should be instructed to point out to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> that his attitude amounted in effect to the first negative response we had had from any government to Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>’s statement; and that if this continued to be <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s position the United States Government, who had not expected this of Egypt, were seriously disturbed and might be forced to reconsider their whole policy in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> agreed that we could not let <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s remarks pass. But he wondered whether it was wise to tackle him immediately. Whilst it was desirable to maintain the impetus which Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>’s statement had given, it might be better to wait until we saw what happened to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>’s negotiations. The surest way of convincing <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> that his leadership would not be attacked would be to wait until we could show him that he had not suffered for his attitude on the Jordan Waters question. We might then more reasonably expect from him a new act of leadership. But we were perhaps expecting too much of him in present circumstances, and it might be better not to press him for the time being.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> wondered whether <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> was really under any special pressures at present. If so, we should understand his position. But Egyptian leadership on the matter of Jordan Waters was no new thing, and far from resenting it more than in the past, the general attitude of the other Arab states on Palestine affairs seemed nowadays to be more reasonable than usual. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s fears might simply be an excuse for further postponement, and what he had told Sir <persName corresp="#p_TSH1">H. Trevelyan</persName> might well be the expression of a deep and enduring reluctance to make any move towards a settlement. If he continued to say “not now”, we should sooner or later have to meet him head on; and the present was probably the time for this, since he was holding up our efforts at the most propitious moment. If we lost our present momentum it was doubtful whether we would be able to recover it. If the Arabs refused to move, the position of the United States Administration on the guarantee to Israel would be weakened.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> agreed, but thought that it was dangerous to threaten a reappraisal of our policies in the Middle East. If that was meant to imply that we would transfer our support to the Israelis, we could not carry it out. Our interests would not permit us to coerce or blackmail the Arabs into peace, and <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> knew this.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> agreed, so far as the Arab world as a whole was concerned. But it might be possible to withdraw support from Egypt alone.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName>, reverting to the question of timing, pointed out that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> hoped to meet the Arab Foreign Ministers in Cairo on October 1. If he got them to accept his plan, it would be a <pb xml:id="pg_495" n="495" facs="0523"/>most important achievement in itself and have a favourable effect on the prospects for Alpha. With that possibility in mind, we should not press <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> too much for the next ten days. Afterwards we could tackle him strongly on the acceptance of an agenda for the Alpha negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> agreed that we should await the conclusion of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>’s talks next week, especially since Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> was fairly hopeful of getting Arab agreement to the main lines of his proposals. But immediately after the meeting of Arab Foreign Ministers to discuss the <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> plan, there was to be a meeting of the Arab League Council which would probably discuss Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>’s statement whether the Egyptians wanted [to] or not. We ought to make some attempt to prevent <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s attitude from hardening; otherwise we might find that the Arab League would be affected by it and slip into opposition to Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>’s statement.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">It was agreed</hi> that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> should recommend that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> should be instructed to tell <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> soon that we were disappointed at his attitude as expressed to Sir <persName corresp="#p_TSH1">H. Trevelyan</persName>, and that he (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName>) would wish to talk to him further about it in a fortnight or so. Meanwhile the United States Government counted on <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> to ensure that the Arab League meeting, if it should discuss Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>’s statement, left the door open for further discussions.</p>

He was called to Israeli Foreign Ministry today and told that shortly after midnight last night Israeli unit attacked Egyptian detachment maintained in zone to guard <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> offices there, pursuant reciprocal agreement dating from 1949.<note n="2" xml:id="d292fn2">For information concerning this agreement, which came into force with the signature of the Egypt-Israel General Armistice Agreement on February 24, 1949, see <ref target="frus1949v06">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1949, vol. VI</ref>, pp. 768–769.</note> Israelis wounded two Egyptian soldiers and drove remainder out of D/Z. Israelis thereafter established a “defensive position” in the zone consisting some fifty to seventy men. Foreign Ministry gave as reason this action continued existence two Egyptian checkposts at points shown by survey to be within Israeli territory in D/Z. Additional reason was recent activity of Egyptians in pulling down and destroying border markings established on basis survey boundaries of zone undertaken by Israelis beginning last February or March. Foreign Ministry said Israeli “defensive position” would be kept in zone until the two Egyptian check posts were removed and a proper survey made.</p>
                        <p>According <persName>Burns</persName>, Gohar had some months ago agreed to remove the checkposts and cooperate in survey. However, this agreement fell into abeyance following Gaza incident of February 28 and Israelis proceeded with survey alone. Removal of markers could represent unauthorized action local Egyptian military and thus possibly be indicative lack <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> control its personnel in area. On other hand, Israelis maintain in the zone a Kibbutz which has character of a thinly disguised military post rather than genuine agricultural settlement.</p>

In consideration incident <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> chairman will also call on Egyptians to withdraw two checkposts and participate in survey.

                            <persName>Burns</persName> said that in view above developments he has cancelled proposed trip to Cairo scheduled for today.

                        <p>Shortly after its arrival <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName> came to see me at <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s request. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> wanted me to know that he appreciated my efforts of past to convince him it unwise move on Egypt’s part make arms deal with Russia. He knew my feelings this regard were sincere. For that reason he wished me to know that arms deal was now accomplished fact and would not be changed. It was in the nature of a commercial arrangement and he would take every precaution minimize its political implication. Things had reached point where he could not hold off revolution in Army if he did not accept. Others would replace him but only with support of Army which would have been gained by accepting Russia’s offer. This would have dramatized affair making implications, he felt, even worse from our point of view. There was one point however on which he thought we honestly disagreed, and that was Egypt’s desire to negotiate on or deal with, if this should become necessary, the Israeli problem <pb xml:id="pg_498" n="498" facs="0526"/>from a position of strength instead of weakness. He had read enough about our philosophy in the East–West situation to hope that this would be understandable to United States.</p>
                        <p>I made no substantive comment to <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName> on <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s message. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> has asked him to depart shortly for Washington in effort see Egyptian action not misunderstood.</p>
                        <p>My own view is that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> probably could not have survived turning down Russian offer in absence assurance assistance of military nature from United States. Had he nonetheless attempted to do so while at same time trying to move forward on Arab-Israeli settlement he would certainly have negotiated himself out of power. This appraisal does not in my opinion reflect weakness on part of <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> but situation in Egypt on this subject since February 28.</p>
                        <p>My latest information is that formal announcement of acceptance Russian offer will probably be avoided. We are refusing comment on press inquiries here and will forward in due course such thoughts as we have on suggested reaction on our part.</p>

                        <p>278. Called on Prime Minister at my request this morning and gave him orally substance <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 195.<note n="2" xml:id="d294fn2">
                                <ref target="#d273">Document 273</ref>.</note> Despite fact in so doing I underscored that Secretary’s statement not plan and <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has no blueprint for settlement problems <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> made following comments:</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">George Allen</persName>’s statement to <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> (memo conversation September 15)<note n="3" xml:id="d294fn3">No record of this conversation has been found in Department of State files.</note> to effect <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> not thinking in terms of unilateral concession of territory by Israel and there must be some give and take on both sides “somewhat but not completely reassured” <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> following latter’s apprehension over general reference to subject in Secretary’s statement.</p>
                        <p>2. He was not clear as to meaning attached to term “settlement” of problems as used in statement. Does it mean permanent settlement <pb xml:id="pg_499" n="499" facs="0527"/>in terms of peace? Does <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> feel Arabs amenable to peace settlement? Or are changes or amendments to armistice agreement contemplated? If latter these must be done according to armistice agreement machinery. (This is second time he has made this point.)</p>
                        <p>3. Referring to territorial concessions Egypt has demanded continuity with Jordan. What is US attitude on this point? Is Egypt’s approach accepted? If so what happens to Israel’s continuity? <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> will not sacrifice its continuity to give Arab States continuity.</p>
                        <p>At this point I again injected remark that although Prime Minister’s comment of interest <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has no plan it imposing on either party and statement made to indicate desirability of working toward settlement principal issues in connection with which Secretary set forth what we prepared to do. We hoped Israel and Arab States study problem and indicate contributions each willing to make. Then we and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would if desired by both parties aid in initiating exchange of views of both sides. His only reply was “Yes, but Arabs have already put forth their claims for continuity and I would like to know <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> attitude”. I made no further comment.</p>
                        <p>4. Re tripartite declaration there was no question as to borders it guaranteed. Now statement says those border lines cannot be guaranteed. This seems inconsistent—why any question of frontier changes from those guaranteed under declaration.</p>
                        <p>I said I must take issue with him on this point as it seemed clear to me that declaration pertained to armistice lines which by their very nature were recognized as temporary. On other hand Secretary was quite obviously visualizing lines which would be considered permanent in nature [and so] recognized by both parties before any guarantee involved. He accepted these remarks without further comment on subject.</p>
                        <p>Re minimum publicity, he agreed in principle but pointed out there no way to prevent general discussion of statement in Knesset.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> in view my insistence US not proposing settlement plan did not at this juncture expect definitive replies to his questions. But character of his comment may be helpful in marking his line of thinking and aid us in anticipating his expressed reaction in these particular fields if and when he indicates what contributions Israel is willing to make. Also these discussions should help us prepare specific questions to be presented to him at some later date and his reception of these questions. For these reasons I am reporting his remarks on each occasion.</p>

                        <p>279. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> awaited my call this morning with determined attitude and armed with notes to raise Jerusalem question (Embtels 165<note n="2" xml:id="d295fn2">

                        <p>Prefacing statement with comment to effect it rather likely <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> will soon head <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> and <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> would hold Foreign Ministry Portfolio, he made following remarks in firm and somewhat categorical manner and designed I thought, to express his very great concern over possible events which would so vitally affect his position and conduct of foreign relations with chiefs of mission of major powers: He hoped US Government “would not fall into error”;</p>
                        <p>(A) Of treating major issue and disturb our existing fine personal relations on basis of technical question; it would be unfortunate “if personal relations between American Ambassador and Foreign Minister were cut off because another room in Jerusalem was substituted for room in which they had in those capacities met in past”. This he said, would be impossible to explain to public. He insisted that regardless of technical inferences it was as Foreign Minister that he had discussed <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> matters with me.</p>
                        <p>(B) Of assuming that new Prime Minister would act as channel for communications instead of Foreign Minister. This would be impossible. The Prime Minister would receive Ambassadors on special business and even then appointment would be made by Foreign Minister who would be official contact for normal foreign affairs business.</p>
                        <p>After developing these points extensively and underscoring again dangers inherent to upcoming conditions, he volunteered following:</p>
                        <p>1. That he and I continue under existing formula with meeting me alternately at Foreign Office in Jerusalem and in Tel Aviv. (This is a new factor in picture and an agreement we thought very unlikely he would agree to if we presented it to him (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 191).)</p>
                        <p>2. There would be no publicity of any change in procedure. He was confident that first meetings would pass off unnoticed.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: My only comment was that I would send his remarks and positive suggestions to Department and inform him of any reply thereto.</p>
                        <p>Later <persName corresp="#p_HCC1">Herzog</persName> who seemed very much excited over possible trouble in this field, suggested that I send Prime Minister’s comments to Secretary in a personal message. I did not engage to do so. When I questioned him as to whether Prime Minister had delivered similar comments to my French and British colleagues, he replied in negative, but said he would so recommend to <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>. I shall inform those colleagues of my conversation as soon as practical.</p>

                        <p>1161. From <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>. Met with Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> this afternoon with <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FAB1">Foster</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> and Simpson of Foreign Office also present. I explained in detail progress that we have made, and said we felt we were near agreement with Arab technical committee, but real problem would be presented on political side by Arab Foreign Ministers’ meeting Cairo October first. Explained I expected meet with Foreign Ministers from Egypt, Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon only. If this group approved they would go to larger Arab meeting for their approval. In the interim there were certain things <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> might do that would be extremely helpful. I mentioned three: First, insure against Iraq’s opposition in Arab League meeting. Second, bring whatever pressure <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> thought advisable on Jordan so that Jordan would thoroughly understand that <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> supported this program wholeheartedly. Third, inform Lebanese officials of <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss>’s desire to have this project proceed so there could be no question in Cabinet’s mind of <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss>’s position.<note n="2" xml:id="d296fn2">In telegram 1311, September 30, the Embassy in London informed the Department that the British Embassies in Beirut, Damascus, Baghdad, and Amman had reported conversations in support of <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>’s proposals. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 120.1580/9–3055)</note> I specifically mentioned Emile Bustani to see if <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> could have any <pb xml:id="pg_502" n="502" facs="0530"/>influence in quieting him down, particularly in Arab university graduates meeting Jerusalem next week. I further expressed hope <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> would make it clear they not only wanted the project but wanted it adopted now by governments involved at Cairo.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Secretary was most complimentary about the progress that had been made and agreed to do all three things mentioned, although he doubted their influence with Bustani and said they might decide that it would be useless to try to influence him. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> was directed to take necessary steps implement these three requests immediately, emphasizing importance of Arab States accepting this project at time of Cairo Foreign Ministers’ meeting. I felt atmosphere was completely cordial and cooperative, on part both Foreign Minister and <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName>.</p>

For <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> from the Secretary. Today at luncheon with Lange, I spoke separately to Nutting and to <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> about the Egyptian situation. I said we were informed definitely that there would be a substantial sale of military equipment from the Soviet Union to Egypt.

I suggested our three governments consider whether we should not unitedly raise this problem with <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> when the three Foreign Ministers meet with him next week.</p>
                        <p>Nutting said he would communicate at once with <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> said he would do the same with <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> when he arrives tomorrow morning. <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> said that it was almost a certainty that <pb xml:id="pg_503" n="503" facs="0531"/>if the arms flowed into Egypt, some of them would flow from Egypt into Libya and to the insurgents in North Africa.</p>

I have discussed with <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> today and will discuss with him and <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> tomorrow some of implications of Egyptian arms deal with Soviets. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> will wish to discuss question with Secretary at New York Monday or Tuesday.<note n="5" xml:id="d299fn5">September 26 or 27.</note> I am leaving for Washington tomorrow evening if possible, and if not on Saturday, and will report on Foreign Office views.</p>
                        <p>In interim, following are my tentative analysis and recommendations:</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s view is, and apparently has been, that he would be unwilling to engage in exchange of views with Israel on settlement from what he considers to be a position of weakness and that he will negotiate only after substantial change in balance of power between Egypt and Israel (Cairo telegram 528 to Department).</p>
                        <p>2. It would be impossible for U.S.–U.K. to cooperate with him in such a sizeable arms build-up in effort eventually to secure his cooperation in efforts toward Israel settlement.</p>
                        <p>3. Arab-Israel conflict holds great danger of increase in intensity and settlement must remain a primary U.S.–U.K. goal in area. U.S.–U.K. cannot realistically support either Arab countries or Israel in complete disregard of other.</p>
                        <p>4. Against the background of recently increasing Soviet interest in the Middle East we must regard Egyptian arms deal as a very serious step toward the penetration of the Western position in the Arab World and we must consider all possible steps of preventing Egypt from consummating it. The arrival of Soviet arms with technicians in Cairo, whatever <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> may say, would lead to a grave threat to the ultimate security of the Suez Canal. Once the Soviets <pb xml:id="pg_505" n="505" facs="0533"/>obtained a foothold of this kind in Egypt, similar penetration of other Arab states would be hard to prevent.</p>
                        <p>5. The U.S. and the United Kingdom Ambassadors in Cairo should be instructed, speaking perhaps in the name of the President and the Prime Minister to make vigorous representations on the following lines:</p>
                        <p>The proposed arms deal is not just a “commercial transaction”. The evidence is overwhelming that the Soviet Union uses deals of this kind only for the purpose of extending its influence and to gain special status. It would not be possible for the United Kingdom and the U.S. to provide arms to Egypt if the Soviet Union were to acquire this position in Egypt. As we have previously informed <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>, we have anticipated being of assistance to Egypt in many ways. If Egypt is to enter into such arrangements with the Soviet Union we should be obliged to review our entire policy in regard to Egypt. Security considerations alone would make it difficult for us to envisage any sort of cooperation in military matters with a country which was receiving arms from the Soviet Union. Also this would bring Egypt into a position which we feel confident she would not wish for. Insofar as Egypt’s power relationship with Israel is concerned, we believe that any effort by Egypt to change the balance of power as a pre-condition of negotiating a Palestine settlement would result only in a great increase of armaments on both sides, without any improvement of Egypt’s relative position, and a consequent increase of dangerous tensions in the area. If <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> fears to negotiate with Israel from what he believes to be a position of relative weakness we can assure him that if he is willing to negotiate a settlement which we believe sound safeguard Egypt’s vital interests, we would be prepared to exert U.S. and United Kingdom influence on behalf of such a settlement. We would be prepared to discuss with him what the terms of such a settlement would be. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> has said to us on many occasions, and we thoroughly believe, that he desires to associate Egypt with the Free World. We believe that the considerations which have led him to contemplate a policy divergent from that are not substantial and we earnestly hope that he will discuss with us whether steps such as we have just suggested cannot be taken to accomplish at one and the same time his object of building an increasingly strong Egypt and measures designed to relax the tensions in the area.</p>

                        <p>At 11:30 at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly, Sir <persName corresp="#p_DSPJ1">Pierson Dixon</persName> said that he had had word from <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Harold Macmillan</persName> that he thought our two governments should immediately make, preferably jointly, strong protest to the Government of Egypt against its reported large purchase of Soviet arms. He said <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> felt that we should point out that this was not merely an incident, but would mark a basic change in relations. He thought we should do this at the earliest possible moment. He read me a copy of a memorandum on the subject, which he said he thought had been sent to the British Embassy in Washington and which was probably now before the State Department.<note n="2" xml:id="d300fn2">No copy of such a memorandum has been found in Department of State files.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>I said I was not certain of the desirability of this approach and would want to talk about it in Washington before making a decision. I asked what <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> had thought about my suggestion made through Nutting that the three Ministers should jointly present the matter to <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> when we meet with him next week in New York.<note n="3" xml:id="d300fn3">See <ref target="#d297">Document 297</ref>.</note>

                            <persName>Dixon</persName> seemed unaware of this suggestion, and indicated that <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>’s message did not deal with it. He said he would communicate further with <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>.</p>

                            <item>Egyptian-Soviet Arms Purchase Agreement</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>… received a report … to the effect that on September 21 Egypt signed an “open agreement” with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to run for five years, in which the Soviets committed to sell certain categories of arms and military equipment to Egypt. At the time of signing, Egypt is reported to have given the Soviets an initial order for the following items:</p>
                        <p>(1) 200 jet aircraft (100 to be delivered by December 1955, comprising 37 medium jet bombers and the remainder MIG–15’s).</p>
                        <p>(2) 6 jet training planes.</p>
                        <p>(3) 100 heavy tanks.</p>
                        <p>(4) 6 torpedo patrol boats.</p>
                        <p>(5) 2 submarines.</p>
                        <p>The cost of the above order is reported to be 30 million pounds sterling Egyptian ($86 million), payable in Egyptian exports; all of the equipment is to be of Soviet manufacture, and the report states that the first shipment has left, or is about to leave Odessa by ship for Alexandria. The first shipment is said to have been inspected and accepted at Odessa by Egyptian military personnel.</p>
                        <p>… Soviet technicians will come to Egypt to assist in assembling the aircraft, but will stay only three months, and that no other Soviet personnel are to come to Egypt in connection with the agreement. … the Soviets are trying to get <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> to use his influence with Syria and Saudi Arabia in favor of their purchasing Soviet arms.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: Other than for the heavy tanks, you will note that the list of equipment does not include artillery, which was reported as being offered by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> early in the summer. Nevertheless, receipt of the reported quantities of arms would, if the Egyptians could man and maintain them, give Egypt a numerical superiority in jet aircraft and heavy tanks over Israel (Egypt now has 52 British jet <pb xml:id="pg_508" n="508" facs="0536"/>fighters and about 350 jet pilots). Israel is not known to have any medium jet bombers and to have only some 20 jet fighters, mainly French; Israel has no heavy tanks, but has about 300 medium and light tanks.</p>
                        <p>The terms of payment are only sketchily reported. Presumably, Egypt would ship cotton as the principal item in payment. The reported amount would mean over 100,000 tons of cotton if it alone were used (cotton comprises over 80 per cent of Egypt’s exports). Such an amount would take about one-third of Egypt’s normal exportable cotton.</p>

Reference London’s <gloss target="#t_Niact1">niact</gloss> 35.<note n="2" xml:id="d302fn2">Same as <ref target="#d299">Document 299</ref>.</note> News this Embassy in reappraisal situation following Soviet-Egyptian arms agreement will be sent as quickly as possible. Pending this I urge we not plan in haste, a vacuum and without regard to realities in area. <gloss target="#t_ONE1">One</gloss> reality is that it is now too late for “vigorous representations” recommended in reference telegram paragraph 5. Arms deal is concluded and Egypt is convinced it can expect no early military aid from United States. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s immediate concern is to quickly build defensive capability and thereby preserve his regime. If our concern is to discourage him from doing this until he has made substantial progress on Israel settlement we can expect no concurrence from him as this in his conviction puts cart before horse. In effect it asks him to place reliance on our diplomatic support as a questionable deterrent to Israel while his considerable military weakness continues unremedied. It asks him to be responsive to our own immediate objective while neglecting his own. He knows his support will vanish if he does and further insistence by us will but harden his impression that we regard him as expendable for our purposes. There still seems to be a general lack of awareness that, in opinion this Embassy at least, <pb xml:id="pg_509" n="509" facs="0537"/>securing arms from some source had become an internal necessity for <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>. He has made a sweet mistake. It may be of future value to us however to recognize that we should not try to bargain under circumstances in which there is on other side virtually no freedom to so bargain.</p>
                        <p>Let us not permit project Alpha to become in itself a colossus to which every other possible move in area must be related, even though by so doing we may wreck all possible chances of seeing Alpha succeed, and as well seriously jeopardize what I suppose is still primary objective of saving Middle East from Soviet domination.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> reported in telegram 548 from Cairo, September 23: “<persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> sent me word yesterday not to be concerned that there might be a change in Egyptian attitude on Jordan Valley project due to recent developments.

                        </p>
                        <p>Despite weakness of key Near Eastern Governments, frequent vacillation their leaders and frustrating delays, there is real possibility these negotiations can be carried to successful conclusion within next few weeks. Positions parties on division water and major technical issues are now so nearly identical that differences no longer stand in way understanding if nations concerned will take political plunge. Best judgment I can make is that they are now more nearly prepared do so than ever before or likely be in foreseeable future.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_513" n="513" facs="0541"/>
                        <p>Quite aside from tremendous economic benefits plan offers all participants, its acceptance by both sides would have dramatic psychological impact on Israel-Arab relations and would probably provide genuine impetus toward political settlement US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> are seeking. In contrast to Soviet policy of deliberate mischief-making, US achievement of plans acceptance would forcefully demonstrate to world US constructive efforts relieve tensions, avoid bloodshed and create opportunities for better life.</p>
                        <p>It should be recalled that Egypt Government throughout two years negotiation has cooperated fully in attempting bring other states to favorable conclusion water project. While some indication slackening of this support in present atmosphere, may be possible secure tacit if not active support sufficient to conclude matter successfully in immediate future. Confident you will wish take these considerations into account in any decisions you may reach regarding present Egyptian situation.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>: I took advantage of a call by the Egyptian Ambassador on September 23 to express very strong concern regarding the reports of an Egyptian-Soviet arms agreement. From New York, I sent a telegram asking our Ambassador in Cairo to seek particulars from <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> and to repeat to him the strong language used in London.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_517" n="517" facs="0545"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>: <persName corresp="#p_PMGWBJ1">Persons</persName> in whom we have confidence confirmed from <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> today that an agreement of the character reported has been made. The size of the shipments was not indicated but the presumption is that the detailed information we received previously is correct. Our representatives made known our concern and set out the grave consequences for Egypt. We are faced by a difficult situation. We could give arms aid or a security guarantee to Israel but this would only involve us in a cycle. We could throw more weight behind the Turk-Iraq-Pakistan Pact and try to isolate Egypt. Up to now we have supported the Northern Tier but have not been eager to have Arab states bordering on Israel join; nor have we desired to build up an Iraqi challenge to Egypt’s position of leadership in the Arab world.</p>
                        <p>If the French agree, the three of us could speak to <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d310fn2">
                                <persName>Dulles</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> spoke with <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> on the subject of the Soviets’ selling arms to Egypt on September 27 at 9:30 p.m. For a summary of this conversation, see <ref target="#d317">Document 317</ref>.</note> I raised the matter with him on September 20.<note n="3" xml:id="d310fn3">See <ref target="#d286">Document 286</ref>.</note> I said I thought it was a grave step which would increase area tension and expressed the hope that the reports were untrue. He unconvincingly tried to pass it off by saying it was a commercial sale with no political implications. In the US the development will have serious effects because of widespread anti-Communist feelings accentuated by the powerful influence in the Jewish press. It will disturb the new atmosphere between Soviets and the Western Powers. I mentioned the matter to <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName>, who was concerned and feared that Soviet arms might filter through Egypt and Libya to North Africa. I doubt that the Soviets will stop the deal but they might moderate the amounts.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>: We are faced by a major issue. I have not been able to understand why the Soviets have not made this move previously. It constitutes an aggressive entrance into a new area.</p>
                        <p>We could reward the “good boys” and punish the bad. We could extend more help to the Turk-Iraq Pact. We are now considering issuing a statement indicating we would welcome Iranian entrance into the Pact. We would not extend additional guarantees, but the statement we have in mind might be helpful to the Iranian Government. We could also give Iraq more equipment and encourage Jordan and Lebanon to join the Pact.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>: We could become involved in an expensive process because the Soviets have available obsolescent equipment with which they can make attractive offers which we would be hard-put to meet. Saudi Arabia and Syria particularly might be tempted to accept.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_518" n="518" facs="0546"/>
                        <p>I believe the transaction will go far to shatter the spirit of Geneva. I mentioned it to Casey, MacDonald and Pearson and all felt it was bad business. It is a reckless proceeding by Moscow which will only intensify the strains in the area. I do not know what Israel will do.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName>: Israel is frightened of a situation in which the Arabs can rush in and bargain off their resources between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the West. Israel knows she has nothing comparable to offer.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>: We should approach <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> now. It is impossible to believe in the co-existence of two worlds, if the Soviets choose this moment to make such a mischievous move.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName>: <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> could reply that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would be glad to stop if the West would cease efforts to build up military defense arrangements. He could ask whether we are interested in a neutral Middle East.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>: Our efforts are directed at an Arab-Israel settlement. We should consider the Russian move in the context of its effects on the prospects for such a settlement. The whole world has recognized that the Alpha proposals are fair. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> offer will destroy them. We are not talking of the Northern Tier or our efforts to prevent Soviet aggression. This matter is completely apart from our differences regarding the value of collective security arrangements.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>: With <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> we should stick to the argument that the arms offer will adversely affect prospects for an Arab-Israel settlement.</p>
                        <p>At the same time we should not abandon efforts at getting <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> to abandon the arrangement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>: If <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> rejects the offer, he may well be overthrown and we could get someone worse.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>: We must try a combination of the carrot and the stick. We could help <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> as well as hurt him in the Sudan. We could permit him to purchase the minimum arms necessary to keep his position and the US could help him with the high dam at Aswan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>: We might be able to sweeten up our arms offer, but we are not in a position to do much with respect to grant military assistance without causing trouble with Israel.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>: We could turn to the stick. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> cannot have thought out all the consequences of his move. We could tell him frankly that we cannot tolerate it. It is a breach at least of the spirit of the Suez base agreement. The world will not allow the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to become the guardian of the Suez Canal. We could make life impossible for <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> and ultimately bring about his fall by various pressures.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_519" n="519" facs="0547"/>
                        <p>The development is certain to be attacked by the Right Wing Tories in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> on the grounds that we left Egypt and let the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in. The Tories will claim that this is the result of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s moderate policies.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>: Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> might draw up a paper covering the above points for our consideration.<note n="4" xml:id="d310fn4">No such document has been found in Department of State files.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>’s comments regarding the Suez base are very important. We did not all work so hard to get a Suez base agreement in order to turn the base over to the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>In the United States we will not be able to put a good face on the matter. It will be regarded as a major defeat.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>: We have not yet completed our withdrawal from the Suez base and a demand might arise in Parliament to stop withdrawal. If we had your support, we might call the whole thing off.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName>: If we could get <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> to move on Alpha we would want to telescope our tactics. We might discuss with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> in detail the settlement we have in mind and then present this to Israel. The above course immediately involves the question of whether the US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> are prepared to exert pressure on Israel.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>: We cannot make a deal with Egypt without prior consultation with Israel. We must continue to serve as a friend of both sides.</p>
                        <p>If Egypt lines up with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, I doubt that US public opinion would permit us to use coercive restraints in the event of an Israel attack. The only reason Egypt doesn’t attack Israel now is that she knows we will take restraining action.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName>: Can the Soviet-Egyptian agreement be used to persuade Israel that she had better make more substantial concessions than we previously had in mind?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>: I believe Israel would be more disposed now to make a settlement. She might give up a bigger slice of the Negev.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>: If we think Israel will accept what we consider a fair settlement, we could then offer this to Egypt.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName>: If <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> maintains he is unable to withdraw from the arrangement now, perhaps we could still work matters out if he would agree immediately to an Alpha settlement and would strictly limit the arms purchased from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to those definitively contracted for.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>: <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> would have to agree to exclude any Russian technicians.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>: I agree with the suggestion, but we must also work to soften up the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>In three and half hour meeting …, <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasr</persName> indicated he pleased cooperate … “on personal and unofficial basis” to find way out of difficulties which he now realizes will follow Soviet Arms Agreement. Drew line at making outright conciliatory gesture towards immediate future (“deaths Egyptian soldiers too fresh in memories our people”) but agreed to go along with … suggestion to issue public statement asserting peaceful intentions and stating desire discuss directly with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> concrete steps to reduce Arab-Israeli tensions. Foil procedure adopted: … write statement in terms which would get favorable reception U.S.: <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasr</persName> will then do whatever editing he feels is required to make statement palatable Arab world. Upon … agreement on final text, enquiry will be made of Department to ascertain that its issuance will have good chance of, at least “softening blow”.</p>
                        <p>Although <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasr</persName> talked at length of his country’s determination, if necessary, to “fight Israeli indefinitely on Guerilla basis with knives, etc.,” he did not appear at first able to recognize and face the magnitude of the damaging consequences certain to follow implementation Soviet arms deal. He later appeared to be quite moved by … prognostications (“speaking stricting [<hi rend="italic">strictly</hi>] unofficially and as old friend”) of what is in store for him, and wanted make it clear that although he “not a stooge” he yet willing follow our advice to extent such advice made sense to him. (This in spite of damaging effect of A.P. story which arrived during meeting. To be subject separate cable.)<note n="3" xml:id="d311fn3">Telegram 573 from Cairo, September 27, not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 774.56/9–2755)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Although we feel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasr</persName> prepared go considerable length in cooperation …, we still somewhat uneasy in that he appears be merely taking our word that his position is difficult and may not be disposed to act from real personal conviction. We convinced, however, that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasr</persName> absolutely sincere in his belief that acquirement of arms was an absolute necessity, not only for his survival but that of his country; that in spite of repeated efforts on his part, U.S. could not or would not give him the kind of deal he needed; that he can <pb xml:id="pg_521" n="521" facs="0549"/>withstand any Soviet attempts gain influence over him: He is equally confident he has capability carry to conclusion successful war with Israel “Guerilla basis” and is determined that “<persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> will not dictate foreign policy”. On other hand he has faith in Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and easily accepted suggestion that should he have opportunity of talking directly with Secretary something profitable both sides would be forthcoming.</p>
                        <p>Our conviction, which fully shared by <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Eric Johnston</persName> is that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasr</persName> remains our best, if not our only, hope here. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> says flatly that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasr</persName> is only man who can put his water scheme across. Therefore all feel most strongly that we must make every effort mitigate the evil effects of <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasr</persName>’s mistake which largely result of concentrating on one problem (the Army and its essentiality to his survival) to the complete exclusion of all others. Pls confirm urgently our feeling that statement of kind suggested would do at least <hi rend="italic">some</hi> good. So far it seems to us best we can salvage from bad situation. Would welcome any suggestions.</p>
                        <p>… Hope we can have Washington reaction in time to have full discussion with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasr</persName> before departure. End Message</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_Tedul1">Tedul</gloss> 3. Following text second message also dated September 26 … :</p>
                        <p>“<persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasr</persName> personally confirmed to me that he has concluded agreement whereby Soviets will provide him with Jet fighters, medium Jet bombers, tanks, artillery, PT boats and other heavy equipment. Did not mention submarines. He either did not wish to be or could not be precise about types or quantities. Did say that first shipment would arrive late October. Except for this statement, and very general ones made … by Ahmad Husayn to <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName>, all our reports have been from clandestine sources, which give more detail but which may not be reliable on every point. I credit them with <pb xml:id="pg_522" n="522" facs="0550"/>reporting accurately what they have been able to learn, but am by no means convinced that the sources of our sources could tell one Jet from another. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasr</persName> was puzzled by my interest in the medium Jet bombers (offered to sell us one if we interested) and unable to tell us the caliber of the artillery he is getting.</p>
                        <p>“Perhaps we should have emphasized in the first message that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasr</persName> made great point of his success in keeping arms negotiations secret to date. Explained that he had conscientiously been keeping U.S. Govt informed, i.e., first through <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName>, later … (when <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasr</persName> became angry at <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> for having discussed matter with British Ambassador) … through Ahmad Husayn. We were able to convince <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasr</persName>, although not without difficulty, that secret of this sort is impossible to keep and that he would do well to take steps to insure that its eventual release is accomplished in manner least harmful to him. It is possible that his realizing this was principal factor in moving him to make statement we suggested (See <gloss target="#t_Tedul1">Tedul</gloss> 2<note n="2" xml:id="d312fn2">
                                <hi rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note>) and otherwise cooperate with us.</p>
                        <p>“<gloss target="#t_AP1">AP</gloss> story giving accurate account of what we have reported on Soviet deal<note n="3" xml:id="d312fn3">See <ref target="#d310fn3">footnote 3</ref>, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note> is most disturbing and dangerous to our intelligence capabilities here.”</p>

                        <p>A. We assume you completely satisfied deal is as firm as <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasr</persName> indicates.</p>
                        <p>B. Will carefully consider statement proposed to be issued by <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasr</persName> but believe it most important that he realize that no statement can successfully mitigate effects of proposed deal. Hence you should not create impression on <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasr</persName> who might be acutely disappointed by actual reaction of public here. Furthermore we cannot insure that any such statement would relieve State Dept. of necessity of making some statement on its own which would be condemnatory of proposed arrangement.</p>
                        <p>C. We are in general agreement with conclusions your paragraph 4 that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasr</persName> remains our best hope and we believe State Dept. will within limits of overall policy cooperate to mitigate long term effects of arms deal if <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasr</persName> in turn cooperates as foreshadowed your cable.</p>
                        <p>D. Accordingly if <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> concurs suggest you carry on along general lines you have outlined keeping foregoing cautions in mind.</p>
                        <p>E. Only possible alternative we see is for <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasr</persName> to issue no statement, to continue to keep formalized deal secret in the hope that practical operations under agreement will be less spectacular and possibly disappointing to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasr</persName> and will give long term chance to help stabilize situation. I only suggest this because I am apprehensive of the effects here of any statement by <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasr</persName> no matter how carefully hedged with protestations of peaceful intent, etc. We note that you tend reject this solution in para 2 your 710.<note n="4" xml:id="d313fn4">Not printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>F. Appreciate unfortunate effects of situation described para 3 your 710 and would be glad have any suggestion as to any action here which would help to restore situation. Our friend should realize that rumors on this subject have been widely spread throughout press over past days.</p>
                        <p>G. So far State Dept. has had no reaction from Israelis of any sort whatsoever.”</p>

                        <p>I discussed with <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> last evening action which US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> should take as result of Egypt–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> arms purchase agreement.<note n="2" xml:id="d314fn2">See <ref target="#d310">Document 310</ref>.</note> We are agreed that, if carried through, it would inevitably have most serious adverse consequences with respect to: (a) increased tension in area; (b) Soviet penetration of and increased influence in area; and (c) US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> relations with Egypt. We therefore agreed: (1) to make, with <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName>, approach to <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> whom we are seeing this evening,<note n="3" xml:id="d314fn3">See <ref target="#d317">Document 317</ref>.</note> informing him that the whole “spirit of Geneva” would be seriously jeopardized, if not permanently damaged, by this move on part of Soviets, which can only inflame Arab-Israel relations, and which comes immediately after major move on part of US that has received world-wide political support to bring about a settlement of principal Arab-Israel issues; and (2) make simultaneous US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> approaches to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> (in which French may also join although we will not urge them to do so.)</p>
                        <p>I therefore wish you to see <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> at earliest possible opportunity and deliver to him the personal letter from me contained in the immediately following telegram<note n="4" xml:id="d314fn4">
                                <hi rend="italic">Infra</hi>.</note> and say that I have asked you also to give him following oral message from me.</p>
                        <p>“Regardless of what Moscow may say, or what <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> may quite sincerely like to believe, arms agreement of the nature he contemplates constitutes a major step by the Soviet Union to: create trouble in the area by fanning the flames of an arms race; gain as large a measure of penetration and influence there as possible; and, through both these means, work toward Soviet dominance. It will be an easy thing for the Soviet Union to so arrange matters that the equipment they provide will be useless without continuing and increasing Soviet technician support and supply of parts and ammunition. Once the total equipment of the Egyptian army has incorporated Russian material to the extent contemplated in the <pb xml:id="pg_525" n="525" facs="0553"/>Egyptian-Soviet arms agreement, Egypt will be dependent upon continued Soviet good will and cooperation, since failure to continue a supply of spare parts would render such a large proportion of Egyptian arms useless. It is by similarly innocuous-looking initial measures that the Soviet Union has brought about a vise-like control of one country after another. The Soviet Union also, of course, must recognize that an inflow of arms of this amount into Egypt will result in Israel’s seeking similar acquisitions and quite possibly forcing issues at this time leading to all-out warfare in the area before Egypt was able to benefit from an increase in its arms.</p>
                        <p>As <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> knows, the US exerted its influence to bring about a settlement of the Suez base problem, looking to Egyptian sovereignty over the base. It goes without saying that we made this effort in the expectation that Egypt would retain its independence and would not succumb to efforts by the Communist world to bring about a situation where the base would be controlled by Soviet equipment dependent upon Soviet provision of parts, to which increasingly onerous conditions could be attached.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> must have in mind also that the US has endeavored to show its earnest desire to help and support Egypt and his regime. We have been, and would continue to be, willing in cooperation with the British to exert influence upon the Sudan to secure an agreement on division of the Nile waters. We have been and would continue to be willing, in context of Egypt–Israel settlement, to grant assistance, in addition to any loan the World Bank might make, in the construction of the Aswan Dam. We have endeavored to handle our cotton surplus with a maximum regard for Egypt’s export needs.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the furnishing of arms, <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> will recall that, following the conclusion of the Suez base agreement, we offered to provide grant military assistance provided Egypt would sign the usual form of agreement required by US legislation. More recently, we approved <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s request to purchase US arms. Subsequently he has asked for special financial facilities, which we would be prepared to provide in the context of his cooperation in carrying out the recommendations in my August 26 speech.</p>
                        <p>We believe, on the basis of <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s frequent statements, that the Egyptian Government is convinced that Egypt’s best hope for future political and economic growth lies in close cooperation with the West. This we most earnestly desire. We appreciate that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> has, for the purposes of his personal leadership and the stability of the present regime, need of an early acquisition of military equipment. We are told that finance has not been a main obstacle with respect to the Egyptian Government’s purchase of arms from Britain; and, given <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s cooperation in my August 26 effort to prevent an early outbreak of hostilities or a disastrous arms race in the area, arrangements could be made to facilitate Egypt’s purchase of arms in the US. The only thing therefore that separates him from acquiring the arms which he needs from the West, with whom he has repeatedly stated Egypt’s destiny lies, is his cooperation in removing the obstacles mentioned in my August 26 speech. At that time I set forth the contribution which the US is prepared to make to that end. Indeed, on this <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> has stated that he would be willing to announce publicly that he is prepared to discuss with me steps leading to the implementation of my proposals. It may not be <pb xml:id="pg_526" n="526" facs="0554"/>possible to arrange immediately a meeting between <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> and myself, especially with the imminent possibility of publicity of Egypt’s intention to receive Soviet arms. It should be possible, however, for <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> to begin with us an immediate exchange of views on this problem, thus preventing an early outbreak of all-out war in the area, which could only be disastrous for Egypt or, alternatively, a greatly stepped-up arms race between Israel and Egypt/with the danger of greater disaster in the future. For all these reasons, I most earnestly urge upon <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> that he not proceed with his plans to receive arms from the Soviet Union.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. Your British colleague is receiving instructions to make similar representation to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>.</p>
                        <p>In event <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> is unwilling to cancel the Soviet arms deal, we shall have to review what the effect of his persistence in the deal will be. There will, beyond any question, be a major public reaction in Great Britain over Egypt’s permitting Soviet penetration into the area so quickly after British relinquishment of the base to Egypt. It would be equally certain that public and congressional opinion in the US would prevent US assistance on the Aswan Dam and other economic aid at a time when Egypt was jeopardizing its ability to remain a fully independent member of the free world. We are aware of the danger of taking action that would further alienate Egypt, but the public reaction to Egypt’s new policy is something which it would be beyond our power to control.</p>
                        <p>We do not believe that any statement by <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> about Egypt’s peaceful intent in making arms pact with Soviet will serve to mitigate in any substantial degree inevitable public reaction in US and elsewhere and he should not be encouraged to believe that it would.<note n="5" xml:id="d314fn5">

                            <gloss target="#t_Dulte1">Dulte</gloss> 5. From Secretary for <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName>. Following is proposed telegram to Cairo:</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Verbatim text</hi>. DEAR MR. PRIME MINISTER: I wish to bring to you most urgently my deep concern over reports of the conclusion of an agreement by the Egyptian Government for the purchase of arms from the Soviet Union. It is possible that you may not have realized fully the seriousness with which such a transaction will be viewed in the United States and the consequent difficulty of preventing it from marring the existing good relations between our two peoples.</p>
                        <p>Since the establishment of the present Government in Egypt, the United States has worked with it in the expectation that a solid basis would evolve for cooperation between Egypt and the nations of the West. We have placed full confidence in your repeated assurances regarding Egypt’s identification with the West. We extended assistance during the negotiations of the Anglo-Egyptian Agreement on the Sudan and the Suez Base Agreement in the belief that they would make possible close Egyptian cooperation with the West. Our economic assistance programs, Atomic Energy Program, approval of arms purchases, and my statement of August 26 on the Arab-Israel situation are all based on the same general thought. We have tried to handle our cotton surplus in ways which will not prejudice Egypt’s economy and have otherwise sought to support that economy. I am convinced that the economic and social progress you so deeply desire for the Egyptian people can come best through continued association with the West.</p>
                        <p>The proposed agreement with the Soviet Union inevitably undermines the basic premise upon which we have worked in the past and sets Egypt upon a course which may well separate her progressively from her natural and long-term friends. The agreement cannot be considered a simple commercial transaction. It has deep political meaning. The record of the Soviet Union in this respect is clear. Initial, supposedly friendly gestures, lead quickly to subversion, inextricable involvement in the Communist orbit, and loss of that independence of action which Egypt rightly values so highly.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of our past cooperation, I feel justified in asking you to ponder carefully the consequences of the course you are now embarking upon. It is my firm belief that it would only augment existing tensions in the area and work to the detriment of the Egyptian people. I am asking Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> to give you my further views and I am hopeful that, as in the past, we will together <pb xml:id="pg_528" n="528" facs="0556"/>find a way further to promote close association between our two countries.</p>

                        <p>Following a discussion on arrangements for the forthcoming Geneva Conference, and on <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> membership (both covered by separate memoranda),<note n="2" xml:id="d317fn2">Not printed; memoranda of conversations covering these subjects are <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi>
                                <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 551.</note> Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> asked the other three Foreign Ministers whether there were any other matters they would like to discuss.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said that he would like to raise another question on which his Government took a very serious view. He believed that everyone should be trying to find ways to ease world problems. And in this connection, he felt obliged to say very frankly that his Government was disturbed over recent events which were not calculated to calm difficulties in an important part of the World, but on the contrary, were calculated to increase such difficulties and tensions. He said he referred to the furnishing of Soviet arms to Egypt. <gloss target="#t_ONE1">One</gloss> of the problems which was worrying his Government a great deal was that of the growing tension between Israel and the surrounding Arab countries as evidenced by the recent incidents which were symptomatic of danger and tension. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and certain countries were doing all that was possible to keep developments in the Middle East within tolerable bounds and prevent serious disturbances. In this connection, efforts were being made as a part of that policy to meet legitimate requests from Israel and the Arab countries for arms; but, in meeting these requests, a reasonable balance was being maintained. If Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> would allow him to speak very frankly, he must say that <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> is very much disturbed to hear of arrangements whereby Egypt would receive very considerable arms from the Soviet Union. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> felt that any deliveries on the scale which had been reported would increase the arms race between Israel and the Arab countries and lead to demands from other countries for similar increases in armaments. This would, in turn, create a dangerous situation and greatly increase tensions in that part of the World. He said that he would appeal to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> to prevent such increased tension and danger since this would not be compatible with the expressed desire of the Soviet Union to ease tensions. On the contrary, it would lead to additional <pb xml:id="pg_531" n="531" facs="0559"/>strain. This was important because when the four Foreign Ministers meet in Geneva late in October, they should meet in an atmosphere conducive to progress and not one of stress. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Government felt strongly that the Soviet action in furnishing arms was not compatible with the general détente which they professed to desire. He therefore earnestly hoped that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> would keep this in mind since all the Foreign Ministers wished to meet in Geneva in an atmosphere in keeping with what the four Heads of Government had hoped for.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> said that perhaps he was not sufficiently prepared to exchange views on this subject but nonetheless he had a few observations to make. He had had a talk with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> recently about this matter.<note n="3" xml:id="d317fn3">See <ref target="#d286">Document 286</ref>.</note> He had left Moscow only recently, but up to the time of his departure, “not a single rifle or bullet had been sold to any country in that area”. He did know that certain requests had been made of the Soviet Government and said that the Soviet Government did not refuse to discuss such transactions on a commercial basis. As for the area mentioned by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>, the Soviet view coincided with that of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>. The Soviet Government would like relations among such countries not to become more acute. With respect to the question of arms sales, he was not clear as to how it was being posed to him. He said, “We have not been discussing these kinds of matters, but perhaps it would be useful to do so. Do you, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>, propose that we exchange information on such transactions?” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said that any step to preserve a balance would be useful and he would be grateful for anything Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> might be able to contribute. He wished only to reaffirm the serious apprehensions of his Government on any steps which would change the balance between the countries in this area and lead to a serious increase of tension.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> said he was grateful to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> for his frank observations and would inform his Government.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he would like to add a word. As Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> had mentioned, he had had a brief conversation with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> last Tuesday.<note n="4" xml:id="d317fn4">September 20.</note> Since then, our information had become more precise. He thought in all candor that he should express his Government’s views on this matter. This was not a theoretical and academic matter as to whether nations should sell arms or exchange information on arms sales. It was a very serious practical matter at this moment. There were in the US millions of peoples of high and low estate who hoped that out of Geneva would come a real improvement in relations between our countries. The Secretary said <pb xml:id="pg_532" n="532" facs="0560"/>he thought that he was right in forecasting that, if at this juncture there were large shipments of arms to Egypt, the result would be largely to dissipate all these hopes. It could be argued that this should not happen and that arms shipments were only something that had been done in the past. However, the fact is that whether it is right or wrong, it will produce such a shock.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that in a talk he had with the President late Friday afternoon<note n="5" xml:id="d317fn5">See <ref target="#d303">Document 303</ref>.</note> before the latter was stricken<note n="6" xml:id="d317fn6">President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> suffered a heart attack at about 1:30 a.m. on September 24.</note> the President had expressed his deep concern on this matter and said he was planning to write a letter on Saturday to Premier <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>. Because of illness, the letter was not written, but the Secretary thought that Premier <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>, through <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>, should know what was in the President’s mind.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> said that he had little to add.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> said he would like to associate himself with what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> and Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> had said. He said that France had particular reason to be concerned and believed that the Soviet action was contrary to the “spirit of Geneva”.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> said that if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> had concluded his remarks he would like to say that he believed that there were “no grounds for any disturbance or concern on this”. So far as he knew, arms deliveries being made by others to countries in the area were considerably larger than in this particular case. He said he had inquired whether the suggestion was to exchange mutual information on such transactions. In any event, he would inform his Government fully of the discussions that had taken place this evening.</p>

A. asked if the <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Sec.</gloss> thought he should include Israel and the <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Sec.</gloss> said he thinks so.

The <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Sec.</gloss> repeated he should get word to <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> to hold up the letter.

                        <p>101. <persName>Burns</persName> gave me following account September 28 his efforts obtain withdrawal military units from El Auja D/ZM.</p>
                        <p>Egypt replied <persName>Burns</persName> communication September 26 by stating <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> prepared carry out withdrawal as requested. Israel stipulated certain conditions as prerequisite requested action and <persName>Burns</persName> discussed them with Eytan of Israel Foreign Ministry September 28.<note n="2" xml:id="d320fn2">The Embassy in Tel Aviv on September 29 transmitted the text of the Israeli reply to General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName>’ request in telegram 303.

                        <p>1. That <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> give assurance her military forces will withdraw from D/Z and communications zone defined in article viii paragraph 3 of <gloss target="#t_GAA1">GAA</gloss>. Regarding this point <persName>Burns</persName> assured Eytan that Egyptians prepared comply (however, he added that the 3 Egyptian posts) <gloss target="#t_mytel1">mytel</gloss> 97<note n="3" xml:id="d320fn3">Not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 674.84A/9–2455)</note> could properly remain, so long as they did not encroach across international frontier, pursuant decision <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> Chairman in June 1955 that they were only check posts. Not “defensive positions” so long as each post manned by only about 10 soldiers.</p>
                        <p>2. That <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> give assurance its forces would not interfere with demarcation boundary. On this point <persName>Burns</persName> proposed that <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> Chairman conduct boundary survey using technicians on duty with <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> and that each party erect ½ of total boundary marking pylons. <persName>Burns</persName> explained that Gohar has agreed in principle this procedure.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_536" n="536" facs="0564"/>
                        <p>3. That situation <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> offices El Auja be “regularized” by respecting terms agreement reached between the parties in 1949. This has to do with guards, availability liaison officers maintenance separate premises for each party and <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss>. <persName>Burns</persName> said Israelis main offender this subject, since their Kibbutz members had interfered in operations, their liaison officer is frequently absent, and Israeli unit had attacked Egyptian guard members September 21. In any event, <persName>Burns</persName> told Eytan that <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> Chairman would present proposals for attainment objective desired, and they would be implemented by parties.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Burns</persName> saw Gohar at Gaza September 27 and evidently obtained his assent foregoing. <persName>Burns</persName> said that Gohar’s assurances not entirely to be relied on, but he had done his best convince Gohar action along above lines in best interest <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss>. <persName>Burns</persName> added that Gohar tended quibble over such matters as marking frontier, saying Israel should put up all markers. <persName>Burns</persName> pointed out importance larger issues at stake and urged Gohar desist from frustrating arrangements by undue emphasis such minor questions. Regarding meeting <persName>Burns</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>, Gohar undertook arrange this for near future, but indicated meeting will likely be contingent progress El Auja.</p>
                        <p>Eytan told <persName>Burns</persName> that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would “consider” his proposals regarding above 3 Israeli conditions. In discussing matter with me <persName>Burns</persName> referred one additional “condition” which Israelis had at first put forward and which included in Jerusalem Post story September 28. This is that Egypt reaffirm “her resolve abide by cease fire both in Gaza and Nitzana areas”. <persName>Burns</persName> understood this condition based on certain recent incidents allegedly involving activities Egyptian “suicide squad” said captured by Israelis. However, since <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> observers have not been allowed see persons captured, <persName>Burns</persName> replied to effect he could not approach Egyptians about this “condition”, which has apparently been dropped.</p>
                        <p>In order allow time for Israeli deliberations, <persName>Burns</persName> has advanced his deadline for commencement withdrawals to 1000 local time September 30. He expressed skepticism favorable action Israelis, owing his belief that “activist elements” may well prefer have present situation in D/Z continue.</p>

                        <p>632. From <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName>. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> and I had an hour and forty-five minute conference with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> this morning at his office. Highlights are following:</p>
                        <p>1. Despite excited public atmosphere <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> was relaxed and obviously making special effort to be friendly.</p>
                        <p>2. He assured us with emphasis that he was “even more concerned to prevent Communist activity through military technicians than Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> could possibly be, because Egypt is country directly involved”.</p>
                        <p>3. Conversation was slightly stiff at beginning. He did not express any opinion during first twenty minutes. I stated purpose of my visit was to try understand as clearly as I could (1) factual situation regarding arms deal and <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> policy and intentions in its regard and (2) to explain US point of view. I said this was not to be construed as indicating US Government had not been fully and correctly informed by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> but Secretary State wanted me to emphasize his own deep personal concern over situation. I would speak as frankly as I could so our two governments could at least act on basis of understanding even though we might not agree on certain aspects.</p>
                        <p>4. I then read verbatim text your letter,<note n="2" xml:id="d321fn2">See <ref target="#d315">Document 315</ref>. On September 30, <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> recommended that he only read <persName>Dulles</persName>’ letter to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> and not leave the text, on the grounds that “written document likely to be dangerously misused.” (Telegram 623 from Cairo, Department of State, Central Files, 774.56/9–3055) <persName>Dulles</persName>, in reply, told <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> to use his discretion on this matter. (Telegram 642 to Cairo, September 30, <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.)</note> reading slowly and enunciating carefully. He asked for repetition at one or two points and clearly understood full contents. At conclusion I pointed out that our analysis was naturally based on such information as we had and expressed interest in further facts which <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> might wish to let us have.</p>
                        <p>5. He then responded pleasantly but intently. He pointed out that fundamental basis for 1952 revolution was lack of military equipment, and reviewed three years of efforts by Egypt to obtain such equipment. He and his government had been most anxious from beginning to achieve economic progress but would simply not have remained in power if he had not also endeavored to equip <pb xml:id="pg_538" n="538" facs="0566"/>army. For three years his efforts were unsuccessful, but he had nevertheless been able to live with situation until Israel attacked at Gaza on February 28, 1955. From that moment onward military equipment had become absolute priority and all other considerations had to be put aside. It would do no good, he said, how many schools, hospitals and irrigation dams he might build if Egypt were to be overrun.</p>
                        <p>6. As regards efforts to obtain military equipment from US he alleged that prior to October 1952 he had sought arms only from US. At that time Under Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_FAB1">Foster</persName> had “promised” Egypt 60 million dollars worth of military equipment.<note n="3" xml:id="d321fn3">A memorandum of October 5 from <persName corresp="#p_DBF1">Ben F. Dixon</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> states that although he had not located any records of these talks, he had learned that during 2 days in Egypt in October 1952, <persName corresp="#p_FAB1">Foster</persName> talked to General Naguib and indicated that the United States “might give favorable consideration to Egypt’s request for military equipment providing a satisfactory base agreement were reached.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi>
                                <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> Files: Lot 59 D 518, Alpha—Memos, etc., beginning after <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss>’s Speech—Aug. 26–Oct. 29, 1955)</note> Nothing resulted, due to British objections. Early in 1955 two American officers, … from Pentagon had expressed full understanding of his needs. Again nothing happened. Then in June he had made urgent representations to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName>. US expressed concurrence in principle and he submitted list. After considerable delay we had indicated he could buy the arms for $27 million. He pointed out, with a wry smile, that that happened to be exactly Egypt’s total dollar resources. He had asked us whether he could buy in Egyptian pounds. We had given him no affirmative response.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> then recalled that he had been assured in part by American sources, prior to February 28 that Israel had no aggressive intentions. He had consequently reduced his forces on Gaza front materially. Then came Gaza incident and Israeli boasts that they would “teach Egypt a lesson”. He added “I have been through a nightmare since then which your Secretary State may not be able to realize”. He referred to doubling of <gloss target="#t_HerutTenuatHaherut1">Herut</gloss> representation in Israeli Parliament at last elections, expressed confidence that neither <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> nor present Israeli Parliament would last more than one year and that <gloss target="#t_HerutTenuatHaherut1">Herut</gloss> would again double its representation at next election. He remarked that <gloss target="#t_HerutTenuatHaherut1">Herut</gloss> policy is “Israeli domination from Nile to Euphrates”.</p>
                        <p>8. During his desperate efforts to obtain arms following February 28 incident he turned to France among others, and in April or May this year, paid 10 million Egyptian pounds on account for sizeable arms purchased. Not one gun has been delivered. Two weeks ago France placed complete embargo against this shipment. Today he asked French Ambassador to give him back his money.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_539" n="539" facs="0567"/>
                        <p>9. In summary he said that in all frankness he had the conviction that US Government was trying to keep Egypt weak and that this resulted from Jewish influence in US.</p>
                        <p>10. I expressed appreciation for his frank expose but said his statement had revealed to me clear misunderstanding between us. I recalled our offer of grant military aid agreement in 1954<note n="4" xml:id="d321fn4">For documentation on the question of military assistance by the United States to Egypt, see <ref target="frus1952-54v09">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1952–1954, vol. IX</ref>, pp. 1743 ff.</note> and our offer to let him obtain very sizeable amounts of arms in US very recently. I asked if that indicated we were determined to keep Egypt defenseless. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> explained at length the reason Egypt could not accept grant aid agreement, partly due to our requirement for <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> mission. He said he had finally been able to remove British from Egypt, had refused to permit Americans to replace them. Was it likely he would now let Communists do so? I pointed to statement in your communication recognizing his good intentions in this regard but said we had had much experience with Communists and knew how hard it would be to prevent gradual encroachment.</p>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> emphasized that agreement with Czechoslovakia<note n="5" xml:id="d321fn5">On September 29, <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> informed the Department “that actual agreement on arms was with Czechoslovakia.” (Telegram 600 from Cairo; Department of State, Central Files, 774.56/9–2955)</note> was without any conditions whatsoever. He had already transferred to Prague one million Egyptian pounds on account and Egyptian cotton and rice would be shipped “more or less parallel” with arms received. I asked him whether he could draw down large amount of arms on credit—“say, 20, 30, 40 million pounds”. After some hesitation he said “agreement is like ones we have with Germany, Italy and other countries on strictly commercial basis”. When I pressed him further on this point he said any unusual features were in Egypt’s favor. I asked whether Egypt might be led into position of being under special obligations to Soviet bloc. He insisted he would not permit such. Agreement did not specify any technicians and there would be none unless he requested them. He said his own technicians had assembled Vampire and Meteor fighter jets from handbooks and could also assemble MIGs. His only problem was to assemble fighter bombers. He would prefer that they be flown into Egypt and thereby avoid any Czechoslovakian technicians but since closest base was Albania out of range he might have to have one Czechoslovakian team for brief period to demonstrate assembly. He commented, lightly, that Greece or Cyprus were only refueling points available. Difficulty with Cyprus was that Israelis would be able to “count them” if they landed there.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> made following points: Agreement makes mockery of Soviet pretensions at Geneva about relaxing tensions and desiring disarmament. Although Israel had at times shared US hopes re <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>, it became apparent before arms deal that Egypt element of <pb xml:id="pg_541" n="541" facs="0569"/>instability. Egyptian willingness accept Soviet arms passed all limits. Now every affirmative appraisal of <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> collapses completely and irrevocably. Similar sales to Saudi Arabia and Syria must be expected. Following conclusions resulted from Egyptian action: (1) US should not attempt prevent deal by appeasement i.e. giving arms to Egypt; (2) West should sell Israel arms to correct threatened imbalance; (3) US should guarantee status quo now and invite any power in area to enter into treaty guaranteeing status quo. Treaty would not bar peaceful changes but would prevent changes by force. Essential take quick action deter aggression in light new situation. General reaction in Israel summed up as “let’s not sit here like rabbit waiting for kill.”</p>
                        <p>Secretary replied: Development one of gravest in recent years in sense that it means <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> opening new area of mischievous activity—Middle East and Africa. Problems posed for Israel and US not similar in all respects. US must consider matter in terms of worldwide confrontation with Communism. Matter of such gravity that we cannot make quick decisions. It unlikely transaction will be cancelled out entirely, although conceivable quantities involved will be reduced. Re <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>’s three conclusions: (1) We have no intentions competing with <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in supplying arms to Egypt. Although we did not wish make absolute commitment that we would never offer Egypt arms, we have no intention doing so now. (2) More definite information may indicate otherwise, but we must assume now transaction will transform military balance in area—not immediately but after 12 or 15 months. We have not reached conclusion that giving considerable military equipment to Israel would be best way to offset effects of Soviet-Egyptian arms deal. (3) US Security guarantee of status quo raises problems about likely effect on Arab world as whole. We do not want, and assume Israel does not want, situation where <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> backing all Arabs and US backing Israel.</p>
                        <p>Secretary inquired whether Israel had considered action by <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> replied this unlikely prove effective in view Soviet veto in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> and strength of Soviet and Arab blocs in General Assembly.</p>

                        <p>The British Foreign Secretary suggested the discussion commence with a review of developments in Cairo and inquired how we analyzed them. The Secretary said that we had no new information with respect to quantities of arms or dates of delivery under the Czech-Egyptian Agreement. The Secretary added that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> had had a report that the Soviet Union was also offering economic aid, help on the Aswan Dam and related matters.<note n="2" xml:id="d323fn2">See <ref target="#d321fn7">footnote 7, Document 321</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRA1">Hare</persName> analyzed the situation along the following lines: When this problem had first come to our attention we had hoped that, by prompt action, it might not be too late to block it completely, or at least to convince <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> to so reduce and modify the transaction that it would be less objectionable. It now seemed clear, following talks of the British Ambassador and Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>, that blocking the deal completely was out of the question and that even the possibility of substantial modification was doubtful. The question therefore arose whether a new equilibrium might be accomplished by inducing <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> to take some other step or steps which would not only be of substantive importance but would also serve as a gauge of <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s sincerity when he said he had no intention of reorienting Egypt politically. Steps toward some sort of settlement with Israel, including assistance in gaining acceptance of the <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> plan, could fall in this category of action. Simultaneously, attention should be directed to preventing other countries of the area from following Egypt’s unfortunate example. In other <pb xml:id="pg_543" n="543" facs="0571"/>words, we would endeavor to create a situation with which we could live although it might be far from to our liking.</p>
                        <p>If this policy failed, consideration could then be given to the application of progressive pressures but, in so doing, we should bear in mind the complications which could arise if <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> were forced out with no better candidate in sight; difficulty in taking any constructive regional steps if Egypt were forced into a hostile position; and the ominous prospect of promoting a real split in the Arab world with the West backing one group and the Communists the other.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he would like to express his own reaction. He believed we should not take any threatening or drastic step at this time. There should be no public indication of our displeasure. Unpleasant events which we might instigate should have the appearance of happening naturally. If we did not proceed in this way the entire Arab world might be aligned against us, which would make it more susceptible to Communist penetration. We should not allow developments to take this direction because Middle Eastern oil was important not only to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> but to the Western world. Egypt, the Secretary believed, wished to adopt a position similar to that of Tito’s in Yugoslavia. Egypt wished the best of both worlds and hoped to play one against the other. Egypt as a neutralist would be more tolerable than as a Communist satellite. For these reasons the Secretary was more inclined to temporize regarding Egypt at this stage in order to see how matters developed there. For example, how many arms are actually acquired—what use was made of them and similar matters. We would have to be watchful of the effects elsewhere in the Middle East; but here the key factor would be Soviet rather than Arab actions. If the Russians decided to go into economic and military aid in a big way, it might gravely disturb our relations with the Soviet Union. In this case we might have to put pressure on the Soviet Union to desist. It seemed best however to try to insulate the present incident. This was not a very attractive policy and he put it forward only for lack of a better alternative. If it came to bringing pressure on to Egypt, the Sudan seemed to offer a suitable opening.</p>
                        <p>The British Foreign Secretary replied that he had the impression from the report of the British Ambassador’s conversation with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>
                            <note n="3" xml:id="d323fn3">No record of this conversation has been found in Department of State files.</note> that the Egyptian Prime Minister had been rather shaken by the U.S.–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> reaction and was not in fact anxious to quarrel with us. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> considered that we must accept this diplomatic defeat and try to narrow or limit it. There would be no agreement between the Soviet Union and Egypt but only between Czechoslovakia
<pb xml:id="pg_544" n="544" facs="0572"/>and Egypt. No Soviet technicians would go to the Near East. The Egyptian Foreign Minister, now in New York, had hinted as much to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>. We should now talk to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> more in sorrow than in anger and tell him that he must endeavor to reduce his commitment with the Soviet bloc. At the same time, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said, <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> would have to give evidence of good will if we were to accept his action. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> could give such evidence by throwing his whole weight behind the <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> Plan or in progress toward a settlement with Israel. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> concluded that if <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> were unwilling to proceed along these lines, we would have to bring pressure to bear upon him.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> thought that the situation might be portrayed to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> in the following way: the Soviet Union appeared to be moving into the area with determination and on the basis of a well-thought-out plan. In addition to arms, they had referred to assistance for the High Aswan Dam in Egypt and had made approaches to Saudi Arabia and Syria. If <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> went along with the Soviet Union, he would be putting Egypt’s neck in the Soviet noose. The action of the Soviet Union in Egypt was not isolated but part of the Soviet pattern. Would <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> wish to facilitate Soviet penetration or to prevent it?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary mentioned that it would, of course, be necessary to find specific funds for the <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> Plan and also wondered what attraction there would be for Egypt in this general approach. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> replied that help with respect to the Aswan Dam and the other matters to which reference had already been made in the Secretary’s letter would be advantageous to Egypt.<note n="4" xml:id="d323fn4">See <ref target="#d315">Document 315</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The British Foreign Secretary speculated that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> might be glad to represent the Czech Agreement as something that was necessary for him to conclude but that he might actually play it down. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> could say he did not look on the conclusion of the Agreement as a political act but merely as one for the necessary purchase of arms. At the same time we could follow a policy of assistance to other parts of the Arab world—to Iraq and some of the others. Together these two lines of action might offset the effect of an apparent Soviet diplomatic victory.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had any information that <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nehru</persName> had played a part. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said no, to which Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said he had the feeling <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nehru</persName> was involved.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRA1">Hare</persName> thought Egypt’s action might set a dangerous example in the eyes of the Arab world and that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> should say something which indicated he was not moving toward the Soviets. Whatever he <pb xml:id="pg_545" n="545" facs="0573"/>might say privately, his public statements thus far had been to the contrary.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we have to take into account that this development in Egypt might take place elsewhere. It may flow from a change in Soviet policy. Up until the time of Geneva, Soviet policy was based on intolerance which was the keynote of Soviet doctrine. Soviet policy is now based on tolerance, which includes good relations with everyone and basically alters many other things. It would not be possible for the West to reserve to itself good relations with the Soviet Union and to say that Egypt might not develop good relations with the Soviet Union. Perhaps this Soviet move in the Near East is the first example of a policy with which we must deal. It may be that internal changes are taking place in the Soviet Union which we will find welcome. As long as we accept visits between ourselves, we cannot object if Egypt does. We cannot be very stern with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> for accepting the fruits of change in Soviet policy. It may be necessary for us to accept the desire of Near Eastern countries to deal with both the East and the West, otherwise a stern Western position may force them to deal only with the Soviet bloc. It was surprising the Soviet Union had not been able to deal with Afghanistan more effectively.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary continued that it was easy for the Soviet Union to supply arms to Egypt in return for cotton. The United States and the United Kingdom and other countries were spread thin world-wide. It was necessary for us to sustain the whole structure in the Far East, especially in Korea and Japan, which totaled annually about $1,000,000,000. If it were not for these commitments, we could take $100,000,000 and buy Egypt off. It was Soviet policy to work and subvert other countries one by one. In these circumstances we needed patience in handling the current situation. We should wait and see how the Czech-Egyptian Agreement developed. It might be that Soviet military assistance to Egypt would create heavy economic burdens there. Our experience has been that arms programs cannot be handled on a one-shot basis. Soviet military assistance to Egypt might not work out well and Egypt might regret it. We should therefore approach the matter with patience and without drastic action.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary also believed that the Russians might not wish to invest heavily in Egypt because this country could be pinched off in the event of hostilities. In general, if the Russians were going to start on a mutual security program, they might be in for considerable difficulty and it might turn out to be a liability rather than an asset. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> commented that Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>’ analysis and conclusions seemed consonant with his suggestions. The Secretary added that <pb xml:id="pg_546" n="546" facs="0574"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> might be pushed along on the <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> proposals and a settlement with Israel.</p>
                        <p>The British Foreign Secretary returned to the question of the approach to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> and emphasized that he should be urged to begin the process of negotiation with Israel. In order to limit the scope of the Czech-Egyptian agreement it should be pointed out that if Egypt buys arms, Israel will buy arms. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> asked what the Israeli reaction might be.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the Israeli Ambassador had come to see him<note n="5" xml:id="d323fn5">See <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note> and had spoken in the following way: the lines in the Near East were now clearly drawn. Egypt’s position was now clear. Israel wished a security pact in addition to military assistance. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> had not hinted at preventive war in his initial presentation to the Secretary. Later, however, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> had said in response to a question that Israel would not stand like a rabbit waiting for the kill. The Secretary noted however that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> had not said “either you give us arms or we will attack”. In this general connection the Secretary wondered about possible <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> stated that the British Foreign Office was not keen on United Nations action because the Russians would be able to pose as supporters of the Arabs. The Secretary inquired whether use might not be made of the Tripartite Declaration of 1950. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> observed that the declaration had been written on the assumption of three-power control. This control had now been broken down through the supply of Soviet arms in the Near East. In these circumstances it would be preferable to push ahead with settlement between Israel and the Arab states. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> further commented that it might be useful at least to reaffirm the last paragraph of the Tripartite Declaration with respect to action in the event of violations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> thought we might reaffirm the principles of the Tripartite Declaration in general wording. The Secretary noted that he did not wish to be committed at this time with respect to reaffirmation of the Tripartite Declaration. A number of constitutional problems would confront him on this score.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said that he was not inclined to take the question of arms shipments to the United Nations at the present time. The Secretary agreed observing that debate might result in charge and counter charge together with details of shipments and related matters. It would be undesirable to discuss in public. It would be wise to move slowly in this respect.</p>
                        <p>The British Foreign Secretary reiterated that our general approach to the question of Soviet arms in the Near East should be played down rather than up. He wondered how we could encourage <pb xml:id="pg_547" n="547" facs="0575"/>other Near Eastern states which did not take Soviet arms. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> believed that one instrument would be through the Baghdad Pact. We might encourage the accession of Iran. He, himself, for example, could attend the first meeting of the Council of the Baghdad Pact. The U.S. might send observers. Considerations could be given to the repositioning of Britain’s limited forces in the Middle East. Economic aid could be extended. The Secretary said we must look into this problem and agree on measures which might be taken.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary added that high priority should be given to considering whether economic aid could be switched from Egypt to Iraq. The fact that Iraq had oil revenues seemed to complicate this. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> said that the Iraqis were devoting their oil revenues to economic development and were very reluctant to devote them to arms. It would therefore be preferable if additional aid to Iraq could be devoted to military assistance. It would not be desirable to discourage Iraqi interest in economic development. The Secretary agreed and added that Iraq seemed to be the only country with oil revenues which was using them constructively. This progress should be encouraged. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> inquired whether a public announcement had been made regarding the supply of Centurion tanks to Iraq. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> replied that no publicity had been given to it although the Iraq Government had been informed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> agreed that we should concert with respect to details of measures which might be taken to support our friends in the Near East and thought they might be divided into two broad categories: (1) symbolic; (2) material. He wondered in this connection if it would be possible for the United States to join the Baghdad Pact.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied negatively that constitutional problems made it difficult and pointed out that adherence by the U.S. would necessarily be followed by a security pact with Israel. These two developments might make the situation in the Near East worse. It was not, however, beyond the realm of possibility that both steps could be taken but the Secretary was not sure that it would be wise under present conditions. The British Ambassador noted that the United States had informed the British in August that it could only consider joining the Baghdad Pact after progress had been made toward a settlement between Israel and the Arab states.<note n="6" xml:id="d323fn6">See <ref target="#d201fn2">footnote 2, Document 201</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, our approach to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> might be delayed briefly until he cooled off and it would not appear as a surrender by us.</p>
                        <p>The British Foreign Secretary noted that we now appeared to be in general agreement as to how we should proceed. An approach to <pb xml:id="pg_548" n="548" facs="0576"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> by the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> or the U.S. in Cairo and for the other measures which we might later take to support countries friendly to us in the area. The Secretary concurred and said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRA1">Hare</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> could work out the details. All of these various ideas could be written down and agreement could be reached on courses of action. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> said that if we approach <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> now it might indicate undue anxiety. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> concurred and it was agreed that further approaches to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> would be postponed for a few days. Meanwhile, if necessary, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> could return to Washington from London.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary informed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> that we might be in a position next week to raise the question of a possible letter from the President to <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>.<note n="7" xml:id="d323fn7">On October 11, <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> raised with <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> the question of arms shipments to Egypt. See <ref target="#d334">Document 334</ref>.</note> It would depend upon the President’s progress. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> replied that if it was not advisable to tackle the Russians in the United Nations we should make it clear to them that they should play fair in the “spirit of Geneva”. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> would want to say something to them along this line. It would be necessary in view of the public attitude in Great Britain. The Secretary indicated that he realized the Prime Minister’s position but wondered whether we wished directly to involve the Soviet Union in Middle Eastern affairs. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> noted that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> might in any event raise this general subject at Geneva under the heading of other business.</p>
                        <p>The British Ambassador pointed out that the approach to <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> already gave an opening for a response. A letter from the President and the Prime Minister would add nothing in this respect.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that if the United States, United Kingdom, and France allowed the matter to rest as at present he doubted the Soviet Union would propose further discussions. As Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> had said it was a troublesome problem. The premise underlying the Tripartite Declaration of tripartite control had been shaken. We could not effectively say to the Soviet Union that the Middle East was our exclusive interest. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> thought, however, that the Prime Minister could say we were trying to work with the Soviet Union but that it was not cooperating. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> noted that perhaps they had already limited the arms agreement with Egypt to Czechoslovakia and themselves planned to supply no arms. As a result of our earlier approach the Secretary concluded that at this stage he would not want to feel committed to get a comparable letter from President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said that an approach to the United Nations might be studied further but that he himself was not in favor. The <pb xml:id="pg_549" n="549" facs="0577"/>French had not been cooperating in the control of arms shipments to the Near East and that if the general subject of arms was discussed in the United Nations the Western powers rather than the Soviet bloc might end up in the dock. For the time being we would play down the Czech agreement but, at the same time, would study ways in which we could back up the other Arab states. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRA1">Hare</persName> suggested consideration should be given to French participation in joint action. This point was not pursued.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> thought that if we ruled out action in the United Nations, and if our policy was to go “soft” with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> and not to follow up with the Russians, we would give the impression that we had simply swallowed the Russian intervention in the Middle East. A letter dealing with the subject, not in terms of the area itself but on a world plane, relating it to the Great Powers’ interest in avoiding causes of friction, would put the Russians on notice that we had serious objections. The balance of advantage and disadvantage was very even. If we did send a letter we risked getting the Middle East put on the agenda at Geneva.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary recalled that when he had previously discussed Near Eastern arms with <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> he had pointed out that since Geneva people all over the world had high hopes. He had said he had now heard that the Soviet Union was planning on arms shipments to the Near East. He did not want to argue technicalities of the matter. He had suggested, however, that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> bear in mind that this action would have a serious effect on public opinion and that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> might well wish to take account of this fact. The Secretary believed that a restatement of our views along this line would be useful. The Prime Minister might wish to speak in this vein as well. The matter could be further considered in the light of later developments. The British Foreign Secretary believed that the Prime Minister’s communication to <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> should be in the nature of obiter dictum and not an offer. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> stressed the depth of public feeling in the United Kingdom with respect to Egypt and particularly in the light of current Soviet activities there. The average Englishman knew of Egypt personally or through relatives. They had followed the Suez negotiations with great interest. Egypt was regarded in the United Kingdom as the Pacific area was in the United States. The Secretary remarked that the communication to <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> might be cast along the lines of his previous oral remarks to <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> noted, as the meeting broke up, that we would have to reach agreement before the Geneva meeting on how to handle this Near Eastern question in the event either we or the Russians raised it there.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> stayed on after the general meeting on Egypt to talk privately with me alone. He pointed out the concern of Sir <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony Eden</persName> in this situation since <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> had been largely responsible for the Suez Base Agreement and consequently had very definite ideas of his own.</p>
                        <p>We discussed further the prospective message of <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> and the danger that it might lead to talks which would recognize the Soviet as a great power equally interested in the area. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> thought he could get the message framed to avoid this consequence.<note n="2" xml:id="d324fn2">Telegram 830 from Moscow, October 5, reported that the British Ambassador had delivered an October 4 message from <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> stating that the British Government viewed the sale of arms to Egypt as a political venture that posed a serious threat to the peace of the area. (Department of State, Central Files, 774.561/ 10–555) A copy of the message is filed with a covering letter of October 27 from <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> to Sherman Adams in Eisenhower Library, Whitman File, International File.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>I said to <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> in substance:</p>
                        <p>“The essential thing is that our two countries should stand together and there should be great caution on your Government’s part in starting a course of action which might lead to consequences which the United States could not share. It is all right for the Egyptians and the <gloss target="#t_Jugs1">Jugs</gloss> to try to get the best of both possible worlds but that is not a role that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> could play. Therefore, it seems to me you should try very hard to avoid being sucked into a course of action with the Soviets which we could not or would not share.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said he fully realized this danger and expected to avoid it.</p>

                        <p>654. From <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> and I had further hour and quarter discussion with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> today. I opened by recognizing that America and Egypt were each faced, with serious problem. Our problem was to avoid handling our relations in Middle East in manner which would play into Soviet hands—his was to handle Egyptian relations so as not to play into hands of his enemies. I recognized frankly that if United States reacted emotionally to Czechoslovak arms deal, we might cause Arabs to feel they could depend only on Soviet help. For this reason I had made every effort, in talks with him and with press, to present United States views with calmness and dignity. I was therefore much disturbed by his accusations, in public speech yesterday, that United States had intrigued to keep Egypt weak and strengthen Israel, and that United States, Britain and France were guilty of “big lie”.<note n="2" xml:id="d325fn2">The Embassy in Cairo sent the Department a summary of <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s speech on October 3. (Telegram 651; <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.)</note> I said his enemies were probably rubbing their hands with glee over this speech since reaction in United States would be strongly against him.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> said American press, mentioning particularly <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Newsweek</hi>, had continually carried articles stating that Israel could mobilize 250,000 men (or more than all Arab states together) and could easily defeat Arab states combined. He said he had distinct impression that Americans printed and read this information with pleasure and approval. His most bitter complaint, however, was fact that even though American public had knowledge that Israel is much stronger than Egypt, Americans were nevertheless highly critical of him now for seeking as best he could to redress balance through commercial transaction from only source he could find.</p>
                        <p>Referring to his statement that Czechoslovak arms deal was “turning point in Egyptian history,” I expressed sincere hope that turning was not in wrong direction. If he had justified his transaction solely on basis of commercial exchange of cotton for arms, American public might be less critical, but when he went further and justified transaction on basis of alleged “intrigue” and “big lie” of Western powers, including United States, I had to question whether he valued continued American good will.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_552" n="552" facs="0580"/>
                        <p>He declared emphatically that he did, but said future depended on United States. I pointed out that arms race in Middle East would be tragic for all concerned and pointed out that United States had done and would continue to do everything it could to prevent this. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> and I both pointed out that only way to avoid such race would be to find means of relaxing tensions in area. He said he was ready but that Negev constituted partition of Arab lands and initiative rested with Israel.</p>
                        <p>I said we considered your speech of August 26 as having created basis for progress in this direction. He said he regarded your proposals favorable to Israel since only benefit to Arabs might be some minor adjustment of frontiers.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> then asked about future of United States-Egyptian relations. It seemed clear to me that he was anxious to learn what actions we might take as consequence of Czechoslovak deal, I thought it best to let him remain uncertain in this regard so avoided point. He remarked that he would always be ready to discuss this subject with <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> and I feel that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> showed considerable concern today, possibly as consequence of his highly emotional speech yesterday. It is clear that he could not, even if he wished, cancel Czechoslovak deal since he would be overthrown.</p>
                        <p>While talks with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> have been inconclusive, I believe we have at least gotten over explosive period without playing into Soviet hands and without forcing Egypt into completely intransigent attitude regarding Israel. Emotionalism here has been so great that I am convinced ultimatum approach would not only have forced vast majority of Arabs into Soviet camp but might well have led to break-off of diplomatic relations and expulsion of United States interests from Egypt and possibly other areas.</p>

                        <p>The Deputy Director of Central Intelligence<note n="2" xml:id="d326fn2">Lieutenant General <persName corresp="#p_CLGCP1">C. P. Cabell</persName>, <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>.</note> informed the Council that the intelligence community believed that the arms deal between Egypt and the Soviet Union was firm. He also pointed out that Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasr</persName> was convinced that he could avoid the dangers attendant upon this link with the Soviet Bloc. The first arms shipments had already arrived in Egypt. General <persName corresp="#p_CLGCP1">Cabell</persName> warned that this development could substantially advance Soviet objectives in the Middle East. The economic tie-up between Egypt and the Soviet Bloc resulting from the arms deal, would provide a potent vehicle for advancing Communist political interests in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>Besides their maneuver in Egypt, the Soviets were duplicating their offers of arms to Syria and to Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, the Israeli Government was demanding action by the Western Powers to deter Arab aggression which they believe is sure to come. They <pb xml:id="pg_554" n="554" facs="0582"/>insist that they will not be caught in the position of “sitting ducks” and they wish both Western arms and Western guarantees.</p>

                        <p>The Vice President<note n="6" xml:id="d326fn6">
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard M. Nixon</persName>.</note> asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> whether the time had now come for a thorough re-examination of U.S. policy in the Middle East. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> agreed that the time for such reexamination had come as did Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> who pointed out that the British were pushing us very hard to build up the armed forces of the Middle Eastern states. Of course, added Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>, largely at our expense. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that undoubtedly we would have to respond to this appeal and help the Middle Eastern states to build up their armed forces.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> inquired whether the situation was not one which called for an interim policy paper both on Iran and on the Middle East in general. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName> reminded the Council that something like an interim policy paper was done with respect to <pb xml:id="pg_555" n="555" facs="0583"/>Austria last spring. He furthermore informed the Council of his conversation recently with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            <note n="7" xml:id="d326fn7">No record of this conversation has been found in Department of State files.</note> and the latter’s feeling that a revision of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5428 would presumably be in order. Finally, he indicated that the last time the National Security Council had considered the situation in the Middle East, it had decided to leave up to the Secretary of State the determination of the time when it would be appropriate to undertake a review and re-examination of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5428 (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action No. 1394–b).<note n="8" xml:id="d326fn8">See <ref target="#d326fn5">footnote 5</ref>, above.</note> Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> summed up by saying that it was his understanding that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> was now indicating that the time had come to review the U.S. policy paper on the Middle East either on an interim or on a broader basis.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> stated that events were moving so fast in this area that he was finding himself obliged to make decisions and that he would prefer to make these decisions with more guidance than it might be possible to get from the Planning Board and the National Security Council in the time permitted. Over and beyond these urgent considerations, there was every good reason to review our basic policy toward the Middle East at the present time. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> again commented on the specific courses of action which, according to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5428, the United States was supposed to take in the event of hostilities between Israel and the Arab States. As he looked over these courses of action, which ultimately included the possibility of physical intervention, he did not find them very attractive.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> again expressed the opinion that the situation seemed to call for an interim policy paper having top priority in the Planning Board’s schedule. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> added that the Joint Chiefs of Staff would also appreciate having a firmer basis on which to plan for the contingency of Israeli-Egyptian hostilities. Things could happen very fast in this area and the main point was that the United States should be ready to stop the fighting.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> wondered whether a blockade of North African ports might not be an effective course of action. In his opinion, after the Egyptians began to receive Soviet arms, the Egyptians would play a role toward French North Africa very much like that played by the Chinese Communists in supplying weapons to the Viet Minh in Indo-China. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out to Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> that the Soviets are alleged to have said that if the Western Powers tried to interfere with the shipment of arms to Egypt, those arms would be sent into Egypt by air.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the pleas from Iran and Pakistan for additional military assistance from the United States, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> counselled <pb xml:id="pg_556" n="556" facs="0584"/>that if, after examination, we find that there are controversies between the United States and these nations, or if we prove to be behind in promised deliveries of arms, we could certainly speed up these deliveries. Most of the arms which we have promised to the Pakistani and to Iran could be found somewhere and in a hurry if this proved to be necessary. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> warned Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> that the matter of getting additional arms to Iran and Pakistan might be more complicated than this. He pointed out that these deliveries of arms were slowed up by complicated U.S. administrative procedures as well as by internal politics and arguments within Pakistan itself. He was afraid that this “hassle” had never really been settled despite lengthy conversations. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> replied that, nevertheless, it would be downright foolishness to let such obstacles prevent the delivery of timely American aid to these nations. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> also advised with emphasis that we cut red tape and get the military supplies moving. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> assured Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> that he would do his best.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President warned the Council that this Middle Eastern crisis came at a very unfortunate time. If things go badly for the United States in this area, there will be many who say that our misfortunes result from the lack of leadership. Accordingly, we must think of what the President would want us to do in these circumstances. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> replied that he was at least sure of one thing that the President would want us to do; namely, to carry out all agreements we had made with the nations of the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>As for the three policy decisions which the Secretary of State was now facing with Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, the Vice President said that there were so many nuances and so many difficulties that it was best to rely on the judgment of the Secretary of State. The Vice President said he also assumed that the National Security Council Planning Board would promptly step up its review of existing U.S. policy in the Middle East and that the Department of Defense would promptly see what it could do to loosen up on additional U.S. assistance to the friendly nations in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> again stressed the fact that from the point of view of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Israeli-Arab problem had the highest priority. However, he also agreed again that the government would have to ask Congress for more money for increasing the scale of U.S. assistance to the Middle East. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> added that if Israel should attack Egypt, every effort should be made to secure United Nations intervention. Above all else, we must attempt to stop the outbreak of any such war.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName> said that he deduced from the discussion thus far that the National Security Council desired the Planning Board to study three matters; first, the general problem of U.S. <pb xml:id="pg_557" n="557" facs="0585"/>military assistance worldwide. This subject was already about to be presented to the Council unless it was decided to postpone consideration of it until after the President’s return. Secondly, the Council wished the Planning Board to study the broad aspects of existing U.S. policy toward the Middle East, much of which Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> thought remained valid. Thirdly, the Planning Board should study the particular matter of Arab-Israeli tensions. This portion of our general Near East policy, continued Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName>, was one which appeared particularly hard to implement.</p>
                        <p>As to the proposed broad review of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5428, Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> thought that the Planning Board would find this a very difficult job and one which would consume considerable time. As for the specific study of the Arab-Israeli situation in the contingency of hostilities, would it not be appropriate, asked Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName>, for the Council simply to agree and note its agreement that this particular portion of the policy set forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5428 was invalid?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that the Council was of course in no position to invalidate by its action any portion of Presidentially-approved policy. If the Planning Board found itself unable to prepare, in time, recommendations for U.S. courses of action in the contingency of war between Israel and Egypt, the National Security Council would have to make a finding in an emergency session.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said he wanted to stress to the Council the importance of proceeding promptly to consider the entire broad subject of U.S. military assistance programs worldwide. Some decisions in this field were essential in view of the development of the budget process for Fiscal Year 1957.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> assured the Council that the Planning Board would do its best to provide recommendations to deal with the Arab-Israeli contingency as well as to get underway a re-examination of the broader subject of U.S. policy in the Middle East as a whole. He then enquired of the Secretary of State whether the latter desired to have the Council concur in the Secretary’s proposed decisions with respect to Iran, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that he would be glad to have the concurrence of the National Security Council in his proposed handling of the decision noted in the Record of Actions of the Council.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of the discussion of this item, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> turned to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and said that if the latter believed that the Defense Department should step up the tempo of the military assistance programs in the Middle East, he, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, would find means to do so.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> called at his request. He said that the British Cabinet had discussed the Middle East problem following Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>’s return to London. As a result of the Cabinet discussion, the Foreign Office had sent a telegram to the British <pb xml:id="pg_559" n="559" facs="0587"/>Ambassador in Cairo saying that the line toward <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> that had been agreed upon between the Secretary and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> was approved by the Cabinet (see “Consensus of Meeting” attached) but that it was doubtful that much could be done at the present moment to influence <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>. The Ambassador was therefore instructed to leave <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> alone for a bit and let events work on him. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> said that perhaps <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> will find that the arms deal is not working out exactly as he had hoped. After a while he may be willing to cooperate in limiting the extent of his deal with the Soviet bloc, in a Palestine settlement and in the Jordan Valley plan. As regards Iran, London is prepared to tell the Shah before his October 8 speech to the Majlis that Great Britain would, after the speech, make a statement welcoming it. The statement would also contain language similar to that of the British declaration of 1950 declaring Britain’s vital concern in the independence of Persia.<note n="2" xml:id="d327fn2">Reference is to British Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin’s statement of May 19, 1950. For text, see the Royal Institute of International Affairs, <hi rend="italic">Documents on International Affairs, 1949–1950</hi> (London, Oxford University Press, 1950), 78–79.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he was still hopeful that as a result of the talks with <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> the Soviets might be willing to treat the Egyptian arms deal as a one-shot affair, limiting the amounts of arms and not opening new fronts in the Middle East. If Iran joins the Baghdad Pact, Moscow may regard it as a counter-move. The Soviets are extremely sensitive to such pacts. Iranian adherence therefore might nullify the efforts we are making to get the Soviets to quiet down. The Secretary said he would prefer to have the Iranian move not take place before we have a real indication as to Soviet intentions. The visit of the French leaders to Moscow is already off and the Soviets may be concerned about “the Geneva spirit” and therefore willing to limit their activities in the Middle East. The Secretary wondered whether it was a matter of “now or never” with respect to Iran’s adherence. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> said that it might be possible to put it off until after the Geneva meeting of the Foreign Ministers but he felt London must have taken these various considerations into account and had concluded that we had better take advantage of the present opportunity to get Iran into the pact. The Secretary said that if Iran decided to join the pact we would give it our blessing but he was not inclined to say anything to them beforehand to urge them to take the step now.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> said that his Government had received from the Prime Minister<note n="3" xml:id="d327fn3">Nuri es-Said.</note> and King of Iraq<note n="4" xml:id="d327fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_FII1">Faisal II</persName>.</note> a list of equipment that Iraq would like. He said his Government was going over the list and believed that it might be possible to provide some of the items quite <pb xml:id="pg_560" n="560" facs="0588"/>soon. The two British Centurion tanks previously discussed have already been shipped. The Foreign Office would like assurance from us that the offshore procurement procedure with respect to the ten Centurions also previously discussed, was well under way. Given such assurance the British could take ten such tanks off the assembly line and ship them right away. The Secretary assured the Ambassador that we would do everything we could to that end.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> said that the British Government had decided, subject only to the views of its Governor General in the Sudan,<note n="5" xml:id="d327fn5">Sir Alexander Knox Helm.</note> to make a statement that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> was prepared to recognize Sudanese independence as soon as the Sudan authorities might declare it. He said that the Governor General might want to get British troops out of the area first. The British position is that all of the political parties in the Sudan want independence, so why wait to take a plebiscite. The Foreign Office does not regard this as a matter of “tit for tat” toward <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> but just doing something that is desirable in itself. The Secretary said that although the Foreign Office might not regard it as “tit for tat,” <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> probably would. The Secretary said he would be happier if this development took place more slowly.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> remarked that Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> had told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> that the United States was going to see what it could do for “the good Arabs.” The Secretary said that we are looking into that and hoped to be able to do something for Iraq. He said the Saudi Arabian Ambassador had called on him yesterday and said that his Government wished to purchase some tanks. The Secretary said that he had informed the Ambassador in principle that they could buy them under the existing cash reimbursable agreement between the United States and Saudi Arabia. The Secretary said he thought it would not be wise to say no, as they might go elsewhere. The Secretary said he realized that the British were having their difficulties with the Saudis but hoped they would agree that the problem of Soviet penetration in the area made this reply necessary. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> agreed, saying, however, that he hoped any delivery of tanks to the Saudis while the Buraimi difficulty was still active might be both little and late.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> said the British Ambassador in Baghdad had reported that Nuri wants to “take a crack” at Syria. The Foreign Office does not take this too seriously. They believe Nuri expects the British and the United States to say no. The Secretary stated that we could not accede to giving Nuri a free hand in Syria. It would have a most harmful effect both with respect to Israel activism and with respect to Saudi Arabia.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> referred to the draft of “Consensus of Meeting with respect to Policy to be Followed as a Result of the Egypt-Soviet Arms Deal as Discussed by British Foreign Secretary and the United States Secretary of State, October 3, 1955,” which the Secretary and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> had previously read. The Secretary and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> agreed to it as a consensus of the meetings between the Secretary and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>.

                        <p rend="center">CONSENSUS OF MEETING WITH RESPECT TO POLICY TO BE FOLLOWED AS A RESULT OF THE EGYPT-SOVIET ARMS DEAL AS DISCUSSED BY THE BRITISH FOREIGN SECRETARY AND THE U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE</p>
                        <p rend="center">October 3, 1955</p>
                        <p>1. It appears from <persName corresp="#p_TSH1">Trevelyan</persName>’s and <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName>’s discussions with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> that there is no likelihood of our being able to dissuade <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> from proceeding with the Czech arms agreement. We should as quickly as possible attempt to ascertain whether there is any possibility of obtaining his undertaking that the Egyptian Government will attempt to so arrange matters under the deal that Soviet opportunities for penetration in Egypt and elsewhere in the Middle East will be reduced to a minimum; and also his agreement to cooperate in such things as the Jordan Valley project and working toward a settlement with Israel. If there are indications that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> will cooperate in such ways, our policy would be to take measures that would encourage him and show that Egypt would benefit by such a policy.</p>
                        <p>2. If <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> is unwilling to cooperate in the ways mentioned in paragraph one, our policy would be directed toward having things work out in such a way as to make it appear to Egypt that such a policy in fact does not work out well. We would not give any public indications of sanctions against Egypt, which might serve to rally the rest of the Arab world around <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>, but we would quietly take measures that would keep <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> from appearing to have followed a policy that worked well for Egypt. Measures in pursuance of this policy might include a declaration of independence by the Sudan, difficulties in connection with agreement on the division of the waters of the Upper Nile, difficulties in connection with the marketing of Egyptian cotton, a reduction (though not complete elimination) <pb xml:id="pg_562" n="562" facs="0590"/>in United States aid to Egypt, and an effort to alienate as many of the Arab countries from Egypt as possible.</p>
                        <p>3. We should immediately take steps to dissuade other Arab states from entering into an arms deal with the Soviet bloc.</p>
                        <p>4. We should take steps to convince the Arab states that are cooperating with us, notably Iraq, that such a policy of cooperation with the West is a wise one from their point of view. This might involve encouraging Iran to join the Baghdad Pact and indications of United States support for, and cooperation with, the signatories to that Pact.</p>
                        <p>5. We should take steps to dissuade Israel from embarking upon a policy of aggression, using its superior military strength before the ratio of power in the area changes. This would involve efforts to assure Israel that it was not without friends and helpless in the face of this new development in the Middle East. Consideration should be given to giving Israel a firm reaffirmation of the tripartite declaration. This is the minimum that would create a feeling of assurance on Israel’s part, while any new security undertaking by the Western powers for Israel would alienate Arab countries who are still cooperating with the West.</p>
                        <p>6. The only apparent way of avoiding (a) an early Israel outbreak, (b) an attack by the Arab world when it has increased its military strength, or (c) an arms race with the danger of an ultimate and more disastrous outbreak, is to bring about a settlement between Israel and the Arab states. The Egyptian-Soviet arms deal obviously makes this even more difficult than before but it is possible that the increased sense of independence and strength which <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> will have even from just the arms agreement and the commencement of arrival of equipment will enable him to move toward a settlement. Also the sense of disaster in the area from an all-out arms race may bring both sides to feel the need of a settlement.</p>
                        <p>7. It would not be wise to attempt to have the problem of control of arms shipments into the Middle East dealt with in the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>8. The United Kingdom and the United States should agree upon the position to be taken by them in the event the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> moves to have the question included in the agenda of the Foreign Ministers meeting at Geneva.</p>
                        <p>9. The United States and the United Kingdom should continue to consult closely, especially with respect to measures which can be taken to implement the above points.</p>

                        <p>106. <persName>Burns</persName> gave me following details October 5 current <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> matters.</p>
                        <p>On basis oral report just received from Chairman EI-MAC he described situation El Auja D/Z substantially as reported <gloss target="#t_Contel1">Contel</gloss> 102<note n="2" xml:id="d328fn2">Dated October 3, it reported that the withdrawal of Egyptian and Israeli forces from the El Auja demilitarized zone was completed the previous day. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 674.84A/ 10–355)</note> and 103.<note n="3" xml:id="d328fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_CWEJ1">Cole</persName> reported on October 4 in telegram 103 that the Egyptians had not removed all portions of one and possibly part of another check point position from the El Auja Demilitarized Zone. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 674.84A/10–455)</note> Second Egyptian check post now moved back from frontier, with exception possibly of some barbed wire. With regard 30 police personnel whom Israelis have established in D/Z <persName>Burns</persName> said Israelis argued that their need for police to prevent infiltration into area was equal to Egyptians need maintain the check posts near frontier for same stated reason. <persName>Burns</persName> has agreed presence these police on condition they are not equipped with arms heavier than rifles and submachine guns. However, unit reportedly has one or more Bren guns as well. <persName>Burns</persName> hopes soon start survey of international frontier by <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> personnel. Some delay is bound to arise over this matter since there are only two qualified surveyors with <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> and both are now ill. There were no especial developments respecting Israeli insistence on observance 1949 agreement concerning <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> office arrangements. As Egyptian guard personnel have not endeavored return matter evidently in abeyance.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Burns</persName> said Israelis had evacuated their military people from the D/Z without any especial resistance to his call for such action. He thought <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> might have sent military units into D/Z without prior consultation Foreign Ministry September which evidently not interested in maintaining situation thus created in absence Egyptian intransigence over position its check posts etc. Israelis allowing observers move freely within the D/Z. <persName>Burns</persName> unaware extent Egyptian compliance with article VIII paragraph 3 <gloss target="#t_GAA1">GAA</gloss> since Egyptians have restricted movement observers within area opposite D/Z.</p>
                        <p>Regarding Gaza strip problems <persName>Burns</persName> has made several requests for interview with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>. In absence reply situation remains substantially as reported <gloss target="#t_Contel1">Contel</gloss> 89.<note n="4" xml:id="d328fn4">
                                <ref target="#d281">Document 281</ref>.</note> He has therefore cancelled tentative plan proceed Cairo October 6. He understands Egyptians have <pb xml:id="pg_564" n="564" facs="0592"/>moved their posts some 500 meters back from D/L. They have provided no clarification their professed willingness erect fences along certain parts of D/L, since they have not indicated where they would agree build such fences. Israelis on other hand have expressed approval of concept of continuous fence vicinity D/L, but maintain their earlier position that erection fence should render creation 500 meter neutral zone each side superfluous.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Burns</persName> assumed <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> too preoccupied with other more urgent matters to grant interview. He said Gohar is likewise involved in wide variety of duties assigned him. As result Gohar is paying insufficient attention border matters. <persName>Burns</persName> said he will continue for limited time his endeavors clarify attitudes each party toward Security Council resolution of September 8. If, as he now expects, he can make no progress he will report status of matter to Security Council.</p>
                        <p>He added that while Gaza area has been relatively quiet his forecast developments there remains substantially as outlined last paragraph <gloss target="#t_Contel1">Contel</gloss> 89. In this connection he referred incident at Gilat October 4 (<gloss target="#t_Contel1">Contel</gloss> 105<note n="5" xml:id="d328fn5">The Consulate General in Jerusalem reported on October 5 in telegram 105 that on the evening of October 4 one Israeli guard was killed and two others were wounded at Gilat, 15 kilometers northwest of Beersheba, by marauders who apparently came from the Gaza Strip. (Department of State, Central Files, 674.84A/10–555)</note>). He agreed that present moment does not appear propitious for further attempts powers support his efforts implement September 8 resolution.</p>

                        <p>328. From <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d330fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> returned to Damascus from Cairo on October 6.</note> On eve my meeting with Arab Foreign Ministers in Cairo, following is my estimate situation in light of most recent developments:</p>
                        <p>1. Usual Arab reluctance face up to definite decision becoming increasingly apparent as time draws near. Following arguments are set forth in conversations group and I have had with Arabs here, <pb xml:id="pg_566" n="566" facs="0594"/>Beirut, and Amman,<note n="3" xml:id="d330fn3">Prior to his arrival in Damascus on the evening of October 4, <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> was in Amman. No record of his activities in Amman has been found in Department of State files.</note> in apparent attempt justify in advance inability make political decision accept or reject Jordan Valley plan.</p>
                        <p>(a) Time inappropriate for favorable decision: Secretary’s speech, Gaza raid of February 28, Iraq joining Northern Tier, and Egyptian arms deal combine to convince Arabs that US motive in area is Arab-Israel peace, Israel cannot be trusted, Arabs are not as united as they should be, and US opposes steps of Arabs taken in their own interest.</p>
                        <p>(b) Development Yarmuk River alone what Arabs really want. This rather cynically put to me yesterday by Syrians and Lebanese<note n="4" xml:id="d330fn4">Presumably <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> was referring to his conversations in Damascus and Beirut on October 5.</note> who assert it better for Jordan to lose 175 to 200 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">MCM</gloss> water from Jordan River and Tiberias storage than to have any apparent contact or agreement with Israel on division and use of waters. To US, economics their proposals should be secondary to favor gained with Arabs by accepting their plan.</p>
                        <p>2. Jordan wants to accept <gloss target="#t_JVP1">JVP</gloss> but presently lacks courage stand up for its own best interests. Syria sees itself getting all hydroelectric power from Yarmuk plan without alleged embarrassing political implications <gloss target="#t_JVP1">JVP</gloss>. Lebanon interested only in Hasbani development and apparently confident can get US aid for purpose. Neither Syria nor Lebanon really concerned how Jordan fares. All view acceptance or rejection of <gloss target="#t_JVP1">JVP</gloss> as contingent on political not economic or technical factors.</p>
                        <p>3. Egypt is key to favorable action on <gloss target="#t_JVP1">JVP</gloss>. As already reported <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> has indicated his support project. This reaffirmed yesterday by <persName corresp="#p_RGM1">Mahmoud Riad</persName> who obviously under instructions, assured us Egypt’s support and his personal desire be of assistance.<note n="5" xml:id="d330fn5">No record of this conversation has been found in Department of State files.</note> This quite in contrast to his previous statement time month ago Egypt had no further role in <gloss target="#t_JVP1">JVP</gloss>. If <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> could now be persuaded take more positive lead than he has indicated willingness to do with Jordanians, Lebanese and Syrians, I believe <gloss target="#t_JVP1">JVP</gloss> will be accepted. If, however, <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> adheres to mere support of program, I fear Lebanese will be ringleaders in Arab League meetings to reject <gloss target="#t_JVP1">JVP</gloss>; advance and insist upon counterproposals; or insist on postponing decision.</p>
                        <p>4. Most probable Arab tactic at Foreign Minister’s meeting will be they confront us with Yarmuk plan as counterproposal. I propose take general line that I came not to discuss old Yarmuk plan but to get their answer on <gloss target="#t_JVP1">JVP</gloss> as now modified meet Arab views. Yarmuk plan was rejected by US long ago as entirely uneconomical and <pb xml:id="pg_567" n="567" facs="0595"/>inequitable. US cannot accept responsibility for plan which could cost more than <gloss target="#t_JVP1">JVP</gloss>, and irrigate far less land in Jordan. <gloss target="#t_JVP1">JVP</gloss> is only plan which has proven sound from points of economics, engineering, and equity.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: Unfavorable developments in Lebanon and Syria (upon information of whose governments I have now been obliged to wait nearly a month) appear seriously jeopardize chances acceptance <gloss target="#t_JVP1">JVP</gloss> unless, as result Mallory’s talk with Jordan <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> today<note n="6" xml:id="d330fn6">See <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note> and possible Egyptian support in Cairo, Jordan prepared stand up and be counted for plan. If Jordan will do so, with Egyptian backing, it will be very difficult for Syria and eventually Lebanon oppose. Therefore, despite odds, I remain somewhat hopeful of favorable verdict.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> met each incoming Foreign Minister at airport and obtained impression Arab states were not in mood accept Jordan valley plan. Lebanon had new Arab proposal which Syria apparently accepted, with following main features: diversion Hasbani and Banyas rivers by tunnels to Lebanon coast for irrigation, power and spill of balance in Mediterranean. On Yarmuk, dam would be constructed at Maqarin Diversion. Dam would be built above demilitarized zone with tunnel through mountain to East Ghor. Total cost about
<pb xml:id="pg_568" n="568" facs="0596"/>$200,000,000, but sponsors would contend US should agree since costs no more than Jordan valley plan.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> stated he spent hour with Dr. Selim discussing new proposal, and Selim reported it completely uneconomical and infeasible. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> therefore decided Egypt would oppose.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> felt best course action was to divide consideration of Jordan valley plan into economic and political components. If this could be handled successfully in Foreign Ministers meeting he felt they would approve. Members technical committee were already in agreement plan best and most practical. Once technical advantages driven home Ministers would then consider political advantages and disadvantages. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> said wished handle Egypt’s role in his own way, but he convinced still possible secure plan’s acceptance despite great difficulties. His tactics would be let others argue political aspects without expressing his views. When they come to him privately to ascertain his position, he would urge them to accept.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> further stated that because Lebanon was leader of opposition he had requested Prime Minister Kharami come to Cairo. Syria was neutral and Jordan wanted project but all 3 governments were weak and fearful of being overturned.</p>
                        <p>During course conversation <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> referred several times to Voice of America broadcast previous evening which stated <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had not given US prior notification of Russian arms offer. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> objected strenuously to broadcast, declared it untrue and appeared upset.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 601.0084/10–755) Negotiations were still in progress for a new government headed by <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>.</note> British Embassy here has approached Dept suggesting rejection <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> offer (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 1676 to London<note n="3" xml:id="d332fn3">
                                <ref target="#d307">Document 307</ref>.</note>) but acceptance variant whereby Ambassadors would visit Jerusalem when specifically instructed to do so while <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> would come to Tel Aviv when he wished transact business with Ambassadors personally.</p>
                        <p>Dept continues feel best way out of dilemma is acceptance <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> offer for following reasons:</p>
                        <p>1. If Western powers accept Israel offer, believe our chances holding Israelis to their own promise better than attempting impose variant on them which they will almost certainly resist.</p>
                        <p>2. As for Arab reaction, believe subtleties involved in differences between acceptance <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> offer and pursuance course outlined in British variant would be lost on Arabs. Arabs in any event will object to any arrangement whereby Ambassadors physically appear in Jerusalem, vide their reaction to presentation credentials there.</p>
                        <p>3. Dept notes French support acceptance <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> offer (Paris’ 1456<note n="4" xml:id="d332fn4">See <ref target="#d307fn4">footnote 4, Document 307</ref>.</note>).</p>
                        <p>4. British point out that if US changes policy other interested govts such as Belgians, Italians, Swiss, Yugoslavs, Australians and Canadians would have to be informed. Our view is that <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-US-French Ambassadors Tel Aviv could inform friendly colleagues and seek support, once we three agreed on acceptance proposals. Evidence available appears indicate smaller missions in Israel would welcome more flexible arrangement.<note n="5" xml:id="d332fn5">The Embassy in London informed the Department it had conveyed the contents of this message to the British Foreign Office, which was looking into the matter and would provide a reply as soon as possible.

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said that Israel was following developments with great interest and recalled Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName>’s earlier statement that we would exchange views. He was anxious to learn anything Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> could say about his trip to Cairo.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> replied that as a result of his trip to Cairo he had formed certain opinions, among them were: the Czech-Egyptian transaction would go through; it would not be of token proportions; the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> having committed itself would make every effort to deliver the goods. He did not know the size of the transaction, he had not asked <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had not volunteered the information. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> was not in a position to comment on newspaper speculation as to the items for which Egypt had contracted. We had to face the fact that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had become a “man on horseback” with the Arabs. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had been deeply impressed by accounts in the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> and elsewhere of massive Israel superiority in men and matériel over the Arab states. This feeling of inferiority in the face of Israel was shared by most Arabs. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> could not turn back from the deal even if he wished to.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> said he was disturbed by the recent tendency of the Egyptian press to speak of past U.S. aid to Egypt in derisive terms and to refer to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as “objective”. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had first tried to justify this transaction to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> on the basis that it was merely a commercial operation—an exchange of cotton which Egypt could not sell elsewhere for arms which Egypt could not obtain elsewhere—but while Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> was still in Egypt, <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had alleged that the West was intriguing to keep Egypt inferior. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> noted that everything Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> had said made Israel’s anxiety more profound. He wished to describe how the situation looked to Israel and then <pb xml:id="pg_571" n="571" facs="0599"/>explore the possibilities of what the U.S. could do to help in this crisis.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> understood that the Secretary had agreed with his analysis regarding the gravity of the situation. A near Eastern government had opened its door to Russia after Russia had been kept from the area for over 200 years. The area had been kept free from Communist influence ever since the Soviet revolution. This action on the part of Russia so soon after the Geneva conference increased Israel’s skepticism of Russia’s professed intensions. He was sure that similar thoughts were present in our minds.</p>
                        <p>From the local view point there was a regime in Egypt which was willing to superimpose an international conflict on a local conflict and bring the horrors of an arms race to the area. Israel had scrapped any feelings she may have had that in <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> lay a hope of working toward a Near Eastern settlement. The U.S. should do the same. Israel had “utterly and irrevocably” lost the belief that progress could be made with the <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> regime. In her relations with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> they found nothing but a trail of broken promises.</p>
                        <p>Before the conclusion of the Anglo-Egyptian Suez Base agreement Israel had pointed out that she did not oppose Egypt’s obtaining her national aspirations. However, Israel thought that before British evacuation took place Egypt should firmly commit herself to working toward “our” objectives of peace and stability in the area. The U.S. and others had said that first Egypt should be given the benefit of British evacuation, after which the Egyptians should be prepared to work toward a settlement. An Egyptian assurance of a desire quickly to press forward on a settlement with Israel had been relayed to the Israelis.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> here interposed that one thing which had surprised him during his visit to Egypt had been that every foreign observer with whom he had talked agreed that Egypt’s attitude toward Israel had changed sharply since the Gaza raid of February 28, 1955.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> resumed and pointed out that the process had begun well before that time. There had been no movement toward a settlement after evacuation. When Egypt occupied the two islands in the Straits of Tiran in 1950 she had submitted a memorandum that there would be no interference with the right of innocent passage.<note n="2" xml:id="d333fn2">For information on the Egyptian occupation of these islands in the Straits of Tiran, see telegrams 102 and 122, January 30 and February 5, 1950, <ref target="frus1950v05">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1950, vol. V</ref>, pp. 711 and 722.</note> Every year since then has seen her siege of the Straits tighten. There were Egyptian assurances that the blockade of Israel would be relaxed. There has been no evidence of such relaxation. During this period of no progress <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had been “smothered, indeed pampered” <pb xml:id="pg_572" n="572" facs="0600"/>with aid by the West. He had been given economic aid without conditions attached to it. He had been offered military aid. The reasons he had rejected it looked sinister. He evidently had been unwilling to sign a commitment against aggression.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> here interposed that he felt that this was not the reason, since <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had already signed such an undertaking in his 408(e) agreement with the U.S. The difficulty there had been the U.S. requirement that it send a military mission. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had feared that he could not permit such a mission to operate in Egypt in view of the opposition such a mission could create in Moslem Brotherhood and similar circles.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said he would like to finish the catalogue. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had promised that there would be no death sentences for the “Zionist spies” who were tried in Egypt last December. Several of these people were then hanged. This had played a major part in the Israel raid on Gaza of February 28. In mid-August General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> and others had conveyed to the Israelis the message that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> would prevent infiltration into Israel from Gaza. He then sent commandos into Israel territory. Although this behavior had been utterly unprovoked Egypt had boasted of her accomplishments. Even before the deal with the Soviets Israel had reason to be skeptical of <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Any illusions which Israel held had now been shattered by this deal with the Soviets. If <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> were going to bring the Communist conspiracy to Israel’s doorstep, if behind him there should arise a hinterland of Soviet support, this was a menace to Israel’s survival. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would have no compunction in being a party to Israel’s extermination. Israel could not bear such a development.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said that he would have thought that the U.S. would have a similar reaction. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> could no longer be believed. The assurances that even after he obtained superiority over Israel he would not attack her could not be accepted. The facts needed a harsh examination. This was not the kind of Near East that Israel could live in. Israel was disturbed by press reports, which seemed semi-official in character, and which gave the impression that the U.S. viewed the situation less drastically. He hoped the U.S. could agree that Egypt was not inferior but superior to Israel in war matériel. While Israel would win in a fight with Egypt it would not be because of an Israel advantage in war equipment. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> stated that if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> were referring to the story from Cairo quoting a “high diplomatic source” he wished to make it clear that although his name had been mentioned later in the article, he had not been that source. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> rejoined that he was disturbed at the tendency to play this matter down. He had been relieved that earlier in the conversation Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> had taken a very serious view of the developments.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_573" n="573" facs="0601"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> continued that a situation existed where one Arab state had made a deal with the Soviets, others might also do so. Economic aid had also been offered. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and her allies had approached Israel saying that she too could avail herself of Soviet aid. There had been approaches from the Poles. A member of the Soviet delegation to the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> had invited Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> for dinner tomorrow night. The Soviet bloc representatives were frank in saying that they wish to extend Soviet influence in the Near East. They felt that so long as there was no such influence the area remained a vacuum which inevitably America and her allies would fill. They wished to build up Soviet influence so as to carry out the “peaceful objectives” of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in that area. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> asked why Israel did not publicize this offer. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> replied that a Soviet representative in Washington had invited the leading Israel journalist to lunch today to tell him the same story. In this conversation the Soviets also stressed their dissatisfaction with the present vacuum in the Near East.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> said that many Arab nationalists thought that the most pressing problem of the Near East was the removal of imperialism from the area. We had replied by pointing out Soviet intentions to penetrate the region. The Arab nationalists then rejoined by saying that Israel is an extension of the West and therefore an instrument of imperialism.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said that the remedies as Israel saw them included the hope that the West would not compete with the Soviets in furnishing arms to the Arab states. Israel appreciated U.S. assurances to this effect and hoped they would be maintained. This was not enough, however, to preserve the present balance. At this point Israel must invoke the long declared policy of the three Western powers of maintaining a balance in the area. Israel hoped that the West would assure her that she would not be overtaken in the quest for arms. Israel did not wish to divert a high proportion of her slender resources to arms but circumstances required this. There was a framework for Israel arms purchases in this country in the 408(e) agreement between us.<note n="3" xml:id="d333fn3">Israel and the United States concluded a Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement on July 23, 1952. For texts of the notes exchanged, see 3 UST (pt. 4) 4985.</note> Israel would shortly be making a request to purchase arms in this country which she hoped the U.S. would sympathetically consider. The Secretary of State had said at least four times recently that the basic solution to this problem lay not in an arms race but in a collective security guarantee. His argument that such a guarantee should be linked to a settlement was now outmoded. The time for such security measures was now. Israel <pb xml:id="pg_574" n="574" facs="0602"/>would undertake not to attack her neighbors in exchange for guarantees that she would not be attacked.</p>
                        <p>What were the alternatives for Israel? To stand back and watch a hostile power increase in strength? Israel public opinion would not permit such a development.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> referred to a hint earlier in the conversation that Israel felt a change of regime in Egypt was in order. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> replied that he had made no such hint but would be interested in hearing what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> had to say on the subject. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> said that while he did not wish to minimize the implications of this development it was possible that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>, or for that matter any of the Arab leaders, would not wish to shake the hand of the Communist powers to the extent that it would endanger their own position in their own countries. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> replied that the Egyptian deal and similar arrangements in other Arab states could mean that the Arab world was closely linked to the Soviet orbit. The momentum toward complete Communist penetration would be hard to stop. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> replied that perhaps what Moscow desired in the Near East was a bloc of neutral states. It was not a foregone conclusion that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> desired major hostilities in the area. Moscow could be the loser in such an eventuality. A final tie-in of Soviet objectives with those of the Arabs could be fatal.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rafael pointed out that the signal for hostilities would not have to be given by Moscow. Once strengthened by the Soviets, the Arabs could act independently without their help. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in offering arms to Israel had laid down two conditions: (1) that Israel forego any security arrangement with the West and (2) that the deal be worked out in the framework of a commercial transaction.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> said, semi-seriously, that perhaps the Soviet offer to Israel should be developed further, to find out what the Soviets had in mind. Colonel Salmon evidently expected Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> to urge the Israelis to publish the Soviet offer. He stated that publishing the offer would help the Arabs by taking them off the hook and permitting them to say that Israel also had been offered the same facilities which the Arabs were accepting. Speaking to the same point, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said that he opposed publication because there were a few people in Israel who would urge his government to accept such an arrangement. Israel could not be a party to any arrangement which might increase Soviet ability to bring her influence to bear either in Israel or elsewhere. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> said what he had in mind was that he was curious as to what a probing of the Soviet offer to Israel would reveal. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> replied that what the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> wanted was an assurance that Israel would not permit an extension of U.S. influence in the area. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> commented that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had maintained that there had been no such condition attached to his deal. <pb xml:id="pg_575" n="575" facs="0603"/>Mr. Rafael said that the Soviets had told the Israelis that their deal with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had been not only commercial but they had also obtained from him assurances that he would not link Egypt in any way with the West. When the Israelis pointed out to the Soviets that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> was already linked to the West by the Anglo-Egyptian agreement, the Soviets had stated that they had received further assurances from <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> that he considered this arrangement to be a dead letter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said that as regards the Gaza raid of February 28 the Israelis’ theory was that it had not been this development but the conclusion of the Turk-Iraq pact which had changed <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s attitude toward Israel and the West. He asked if the U.S. were any nearer a position whereby a reply to Israel’s proposals for dealing with this situation could be expected. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> replied negatively. He had been able to report on this matter only hurriedly to the Secretary. We had not as yet come to a fixed policy on the subject. It was hard to make an estimate on the situation when there was so little real information available.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rafael returned to Israel’s experience with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> and emphasized that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had been forthcoming with promises but not with performances. Israel was convinced that since the Gaza ceasefire had come into effect <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had moved the base of terrorist operations to Syria and Lebanon. These operations were being conducted partly by people who had been locally recruited and partly by trained Egyptian agents who had been sent through Israel to the other Arab states.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Salmon stated that he was leaving for Israel that night. He wondered if he could convey any contemplation on the part of the U.S. Government of available courses of action. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> said that there was one thing in the air, which was a possibility of an agreement on the Jordan water scheme. He had been discouraged by Lebanese opposition to such a scheme which had recently emerged. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> recalled that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had been consistently hostile to the <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> Plan. He said that at the time of the Jisr Banat Ya’aqub discussion in the Security Council, Vishinsky had told him that the Soviets had used their veto only because they thought that Israel’s action on the upper Jordan River had been an implementation of an American plan. The Soviets were obsessed over the point of American influence in the area.</p>
                        <p>In departing Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said that he would be in touch with the Department relative to the arrival of the Israel Prime Minister in this <pb xml:id="pg_576" n="576" facs="0604"/>country.<note n="4" xml:id="d333fn4">According to a memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_HJWJ1">Hanes</persName> on October 19, the Israeli Embassy advised the Department that <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> had to defer his visit to the United States and cancel an October 21 appointment with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> because his designated successor as Prime Minister, <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>, was ill.

A memorandum of the conversation by <persName>Dulles</persName> reads in part as follows:</p>
                        <p>“We then spoke of the Soviet arms deal for Egypt. I said that this was creating widespread repercussions, which could not yet be fully appraised, and it might at a later date require considered attention by the two of us. I thought, however, that it would be useful now to indicate to <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> that the matter had the President’s attention and concern. I said that <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> had written a quite long and strong letter to <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>, but I felt that it was better from the President’s standpoint only to touch on the matter lightly.</p>
                        <p>“I then showed the President a suggested form of letter, which he read and indicated met fully with his approval, and he then signed it.” (Eisenhower Library, Dulles Papers, Meetings with the President)</p>

                        <p>“I am concerned about the new prospective arms shipments to Egypt. I fear that they will not promote the goals which, I hope we have in common—that is a relaxation of tensions between us and a peacefully constructive solution of the Arab-Israel problem.</p>

                        <p rend="center">The Problem</p>
                        <p>To estimate, in the light of the recent Egyptian arms deal with the Soviet Bloc: (a) the likelihood of Israeli or Egyptian-instigated hostilities assuming no change in present US policy; (b) the effect of certain possible US courses of action on the situation; and (c) the outlook for Soviet exploitation of this and possible similar deals with other Arab states.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_578" n="578" facs="0606"/>
                        <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                        <p>1. The Soviet-Egyptian arms deal has substantially increased the risk that Israel will launch a “preventive war.” Such Israeli action is not likely within the next few weeks. The Israelis will probably wish to determine more precisely the magnitude of the threat posed by Soviet Bloc willingness to arm the Arabs, to exploit the favorable trend of Western public opinion, and, most importantly, to determine how far Israel can realistically depend on Western and particularly US support in maintaining its territorial integrity. In the absence of convincing evidence of Western determination to preserve the territorial status quo, there is very real danger that Israel will undertake “preventive war,” possibly in the next few months, and it would almost certainly be more willing to take risks which could touch off a new round of hostilities. An Israeli “preventive war” may start in the form of border raids where responsibilities and intentions may initially be obscure. (Paras. 11–13)</p>
                        <p>2. If it became unmistakably clear to both sides that the US was prepared to use any means necessary, including military force, to halt aggression, it is almost certain that no “second round” would develop. However, if the US declined to guarantee the territorial status quo in a new and more direct pledge than that contained in the Tripartite Declaration, it would be extremely difficult to deter Israeli preventive action, since neither the Israelis nor the Arabs would be likely to believe that the US would in fact intervene effectively against Israel. (Para. 16)</p>
                        <p>3. Assuming that it is actually implemented, the arms deal is likely to strengthen a tendency toward Egyptian militancy, and increase the danger that local clashes will develop into large-scale fighting. However, pending absorption of the new equipment Egypt will probably feel constrained to avoid serious difficulties with Israel. Over the longer run, the growth of Egyptian military strength will almost certainly stimulate some Egyptian interest in a “second round” against Israel. (Paras. 8, 14–15)</p>
                        <p>4. Should a “second round” occur in the near future, in which the US simply let events take their course, an Israeli victory would be almost certain. Under these circumstances Israeli ability to seize and hold considerable portions of all its neighbors’ territories would be limited largely by its lack of reserve supplies and the probability of <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> intervention if Jordan were invaded. The effects of a “hands off” policy on the part of the US would have an extremely adverse effect on its position in the Arab world and would retard US efforts to build indigenous Middle East defense. (Paras. 18–19)</p>
                        <p>5. A convincing indication of US determination to intervene effectively in the event of aggression would reassure both sides. <pb xml:id="pg_579" n="579" facs="0607"/>Nevertheless, the Arabs would regard it primarily as a guarantee of Israel’s present position. Arab resentment would in time increase, particularly if growing Arab military capabilities placed the Arabs in the position of the ones being restrained. (Para. 17)</p>
                        <p>6. Soviet arms aid to Egypt will complicate if not block the achievement of two major US objectives in the Middle East: an Arab-Israeli settlement and the creation of effective regional defense arrangements against Communism. It is likely to stimulate neutralist tendencies in Egypt and other Arab states, and to enhance the capabilities of local Communists for subversion and political penetration. Although we believe that the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> is determined to avoid close political alignment with the Soviets, increasing military and economic dependence on the Bloc might eventually deprive it of some of its freedom to choose its orientation. (Paras. 20–23)</p>
                        <p rend="center">Discussion</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. The Arms Deal and Its Military Implications</p>
                        <p>7. On 21 September 1955 the Soviet Bloc agreed to furnish in exchange for Egyptian cotton a supply of arms at bargain rates …. Bloc technicians would be made available over a 90-day period to instruct the Egyptians in maintenance and operation.</p>
                        <p>8. Assuming that the Bloc actually supplies these items, in terms of military hardware alone the deal would: (a) give Egypt marked qualitative and quantitative superiority in combat aircraft over Israel, which is already inferior in numbers of aircraft to the Arab states as a group; (b) significantly reduce Israel’s present numerical superiority in tanks; and (c) furnish Egypt with means of harassing Israel’s shipping. Some of the equipment will probably be placed in operation within a few months after delivery. However, it is estimated that even under optimum conditions, involving large bloc training missions ever an extended period, at least a year would probably be required after delivery before most of the equipment could be effectively used in unit operations.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II The Effect on Israeli Courses of Action</p>
                        <p>9. The arms deal constitutes a severe psychological blow to Israel. At a minimum it will in time make the Egyptians more able and willing to stand up to or retaliate against Israeli military raids, thereby lessening the likelihood that Israel’s activist raiding tactics will force the Arabs to make peace. At a maximum it brings materially closer the spectre of a growth of Arab military strength which would leave Israel incapable of defending itself effectively. Although the Israelis probably recognize that the military effects of <pb xml:id="pg_580" n="580" facs="0608"/>the arms deal will not be immediately felt, they probably believe that they have only limited time to adjust to the situation.</p>
                        <p>10. These considerations are almost certainly stimulating increasing pressures within Israel for a bolder and more aggressive effort to resolve the basic problem of security once and for all. The Israeli government has responded with strong pressures on the US for compensating arms aid and for a specific security guarantee, and it will almost certainly make additional efforts, within the relatively narrow limits of its potential resources, to procure arms elsewhere if they are not available from the US. Meanwhile, Israel is almost certainly canvassing the possibilities of military solutions. Prime Minister-designate <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> had previously announced that Israel will take forcible measures if necessary to end the Egyptian blockade of the sea route to Elath on the Gulf of Aqaba.<note n="3" xml:id="d335fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> stated this during a campaign speech on July 8, 1955. (Telegram 18 from Tel Aviv, July 11; Department of State, Central Files, 784A.00/7–1155)<p>On September 10, Egypt announced new and more stringent regulations to govern shipping in the Gulf of Aqaba. According to the new rules, all ships intending to sail through the Gulf had to obtain Egypt’s permission at least 72 hours in advance since they would be passing through Egyptian territorial waters. Egypt refused to grant the right of passage to Israeli ships since a state of war existed between Egypt and Israel.</p>
                            </note> The Israeli General Staff, which recommended expulsion of the Egyptians from the Gaza strip a few months ago, is probably pressing for at least limited territorial advances for the purposes of eliminating trouble spots and otherwise improving Israel’s position at tactically vulnerable places along the border. Moreover, consideration is probably being given to the merits of a “preventive war” while Israel still holds a decisive military edge.</p>
                        <p>11. The Soviet-Egyptian arms deal has substantially increased the risk that Israel will launch a “preventive war.” It is unlikely, however, that Israel will initiate such action in the next few weeks. Before committing themselves to an outright war policy, the Israelis will probably wish to determine more precisely the magnitude of the threat posed by Soviet Bloc willingness to arm the Arabs, to exploit the favorable trend of Western public opinion, and, more importantly, to determine how far Israel can realistically depend on Western and particularly US support in maintaining its territorial integrity.</p>
                        <p>12. Particularly if the prospects of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and Western counteraction in curbing incidents are uncertain, we believe that Israel, in its present mood, will almost certainly be more disposed than before the arms deal to take chances in execution of its activist policies. Such a move might touch off a new round of large-scale hostilities, whether by design or otherwise. Israel’s proposed move to force the Gulf of Aqaba might prove such a stepping stone to war, as might <pb xml:id="pg_581" n="581" facs="0609"/>also an Israeli move to intercept arms shipments to Egypt or resumption of the work to divert the Jordan waters in the demilitarized zone at Jisr Banat Yacub on the Syrian border. Should Israel find itself engaged in major clashes with one of the Arab states it would probably be increasingly disposed to take advantage of the situation to seize the troubled area or otherwise improve its tactical position. Should the intervention of other Arab states appear to be in the offing it would probably attempt to seize the initiative and in so doing make a general conflict inevitable.</p>
                        <p>13. Moreover, in the absence of convincing evidence of Western determination to preserve the territorial status quo, there is very real danger that Israel will undertake a “preventive war,” possibly within the next few months. The Egyptian arms deal, particularly if followed up by a similar deal with Syria, threatens Israel with an arms race which it cannot afford to sustain with its own resources and which ultimately threatens to leave it incapable of defending itself effectively. Unless Israel obtains countervailing arms aid or a new and more direct US pledge of prompt and effective military intervention to preserve the territorial status quo than is now provided in the Tripartite Declaration, it is likely to conclude that war offers the only way out. Under such circumstances, Israel is also likely to play down the possibility of effective Western intervention against a “preventive war” by Israel, which the latter would portray as a defensive reaction to Arab aggression inspired and armed by the Soviet Union and which was accompanied by offers to negotiate a firm peace. An Israel “preventive war” may start in the form of border raids where responsibilities and intentions may initially be obscure.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. Effect on Egyptian Courses of Action</p>
                        <p>14. We believe that Egypt’s acceptance of Bloc arms has been motivated far less by thoughts of a “second round” than by: (a) the necessity to shore up armed forces morale; (b) an acute sense of vulnerability to Israeli military harassment and possible invasion; and (c) its desire to follow through on its announced policy of independence from both great power blocs. However, the arms deal, assuming that it is actually implemented, is likely to strengthen a tendency toward greater militancy vis-à-vis Israel already manifest in the Egyptian government’s recent sponsorship of commando operations in the Gaza area. This will increase the danger that local clashes will develop into large-scale fighting. For the immediate future, the Egyptian regime will probably feel constrained to avoid serious difficulties with Israel, pending the arrival of the new equipment and the training of combat-effective units. However, even <pb xml:id="pg_582" n="582" facs="0610"/>during this interim period the difficulty of holding Egyptian local commanders and troops in check will probably create increased hazards of a flareup.</p>
                        <p>15. Over the longer run, the growth of Egyptian military strength will almost certainly stimulate some Egyptian interest in a “second round” against Israel. Although the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> regime has manifested concern over the fact that Israeli possession of the Negev cuts Egypt off from land communication with the other Arab states, it has no territorial ambitions of its own in Israel, will probably retain a healthy respect for Israeli combat effectiveness, and—despite its attempts to free itself from dependence on the West—will probably remain fearful of Western sanctions. Assuming that Egypt believes itself greatly strengthened by Soviet arms and support, it might be tempted to make war on Israel as a means of solidifying its leadership in the Arab world. While the deterrents mentioned are likely to prevent such action, at least in the near future, Egypt will almost certainly do its best to impress the Israelis with its will and ability to defend its interests and may therefore end up with fully as aggressive and activist a policy as that now being pursued by Israel.</p>

                        <p>16. If it became unmistakably clear to both sides that the US was prepared to use any means necessary, including military force, to halt aggression, it is almost certain that no “second round” would develop. However, if the US declined to guarantee the territorial status quo in a new and more direct pledge than that contained in the Tripartite Declaration of 1950, it would be extremely difficult to deter Israeli preventive action since neither the Israelis nor the Arabs would be likely to believe that the US would in fact intervene effectively against Israel.</p>
                        <p>17. A convincing indication of US determination to intervene effectively in the event of aggression would reassure both sides. Nonetheless, the Arabs would regard it primarily as a guarantee of Israel’s present position. Over the long run, the concept of the US as a policeman, even if backed by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, would be a source of increasing Arab resentment, particularly if increasing Arab military capabilities placed the Arabs in the position of the ones being restrained.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">V. Probable Consequences of a US “Hands Off” Policy in Response to an Israeli</p>
                        <p>Attack</p>
                        <p>18. If aggressive Israeli action should lead in the near future to a “second round,” in which the US stood aside and let developments take their course, all the Arab League states would almost certainly <pb xml:id="pg_583" n="583" facs="0611"/>become involved, and an Israeli victory would almost certainly be the outcome. Against Arab opposition alone, we estimate that Israel could now seize all of Arab-controlled Palestine, portions of Egyptian, Syrian, and Lebanese territory contiguous to Israel, and some Jordanian territory east of the Jordan River. Israel would probably have to reckon with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> intervention. However, the most important limitations to Israel’s ability to consolidate these gains would be its own lack of reserve supplies and the probability that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, because of its special treaty obligations, would feel compelled to intervene, at least with air and naval forces, if Jordan were invaded. Egypt’s capabilities would be substantially improved if it could actually employ Soviet Bloc military personnel in using its new weapons against Israel. However, it appears unlikely that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, under present circumstances, would be willing to accept the risks of hostilities with the West which such a move would involve. A defeat of the Arabs would probably be followed by a period of disorder in one or more of the Arab states, a condition which the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would almost certainly attempt to exploit.</p>
                        <p>19. A “hands off” policy on the part of the US would have an extremely adverse effect on its position in the Arab world, and would retard US efforts to build indigenous Middle East defense.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">VI. Probable Soviet Objectives and Prospects for Success</p>
                        <p>20. The arms deal with Egypt represents the most dramatic move in a Soviet campaign in the Middle East which has been under way for some time. A major objective of this campaign is almost certainly to stiffen Arab resistance to Western policies in the area, particularly the efforts of the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to develop anti-Communist defense arrangements and to retain their bases. Since the signing of the Baghdad Pact,<note n="4" xml:id="d335fn4">Turkey, Iraq, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, and Pakistan are now members of this pact. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> Egypt has led Arab opposition to Western defense efforts, and Syria and Saudi Arabia, the other recipients of Soviet arms offers, have been Egypt’s chief supporters. Moreover, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> almost certainly appreciates that US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> difficulties in creating a defense system will be seriously increased: (a) by any heightening of Arab-Israeli tensions; (b) by the Western Powers losing the advantage of being the only significant source of arms for the Arab states; and (c) by invidious comparisons in Arab minds between the spectacular amount and easy terms of Soviet aid promised to Egypt, and the relative handful of matériel which Iraq has been receiving as a member in good standing of the “northern tier” group of nations.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_584" n="584" facs="0612"/>
                        <p>21. In addition to its usefulness in undermining Western defense efforts in the area, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> probably regards the arms deal as a means of strengthening neutralist tendencies in Egypt and other Arab states, if only by weakening their dependence on the West and increasing Soviet bargaining power. Egypt’s decision to accept arms from the Bloc in exchange for cotton, together with recent agreements for substantially increased barter trade in nonmilitary items, would probably increase Egyptian reliance on the Orbit for continuing training needs and maintenance supplies and possibly as a market for Egypt’s primary export item. Finally, the Soviets probably will see increased opportunities for subversion and political penetration, not only through increased Soviet influence, but also through the introduction of Soviet technical and commercial personnel in the Arab states.</p>
                        <p>22. We believe that the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> is determined to avoid any kind of close alignment with the Soviet Bloc. It is most unlikely that Egypt would pay a price for Soviet arms in the form of any kind of political commitments when it has been unwilling to pay such a price for Western arms. The same apprehensive, suspicious nationalism that caused Egypt to reject alignment with the West in a Middle East defense organization will probably work with equal force against any efforts of the Soviets to obtain a special position in Egypt. Should Egypt become increasingly dependent on the Bloc economically and militarily, and at the same time more isolated from the West, it might eventually lose some of its freedom to choose its orientation.</p>
                        <p>23. On the other hand, Soviet chances for fostering Egyptian neutralism are more promising and immediate. Strong neutralist tendencies already exist within the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> and among its supporters. Egyptian receipt of Soviet arms aid is likely to strengthen this inclination, particularly since Soviet aid will raise Egyptian hopes of the advantages to be derived from playing off the Soviets and the West against each other. Initially at least, indigenous Communist standing will be improved by Egyptian acceptance of Soviet Bloc aid.</p>
                        <p>24. At present, the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> regime probably overestimates its ability to handle both the short and longer-range risks of accepting the Soviet arms offer. The sheer technical problems of assembling and maintaining the relatively modem matériel involved, quite aside from training Egyptian personnel to use it effectively, will place the regime under strong compulsions to admit greater numbers of Bloc technicians and training personnel for longer periods than it probably now thinks will be necessary. Having acquired the arms, <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasr</persName> will be reluctant to close Egypt’s doors to the personnel needed to make them useful. Particularly if the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> itself and the Bloc representatives sent to Egypt are careful at the outset to avoid the <pb xml:id="pg_585" n="585" facs="0613"/>appearance of having political or subversive designs, this reluctance will become even greater. And if Israel should continue to provoke and frighten the regime by activist policies on the border, the pressures to seek Bloc technical and military help would be great. This, in turn, would lead to increased Soviet bargaining power and opportunities for penetration, with consequent advantages to long-term Soviet political goals. Similarly, growing economic dependence on the Bloc as a market for Egyptian cotton might give the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> increased power to influence Egypt either by threats or inducements. In accord with its current policy of relaxation of tensions, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will probably be very circumspect in its relations with Egypt in order to encourage nations around the periphery of the Communist Bloc to adopt a neutralist course as an inexpensive and, indeed, profitable means of assuring their independence and security.</p>
                        <p>25. Egyptian acceptance of Bloc arms and assertion of an “independent foreign policy” has made a profound impression in other Arab states and increases the chances that Syria would accept a Soviet arms offer. In view of the basic instability of the Syrian political situation, the greater potential of the well-organized Syrian Communist Party (whose leader is a member of Parliament), and the strength of leftist elements in the army, the possibilities of an increasingly leftist course in Syria are considered greater.</p>
                        <p>26. Saudi Arabia’s resistance to Bloc penetration is probably much greater than Syria’s and the chances of its accepting large-scale Bloc arms aid may be considered less. However, its increasing conflict with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and the strong feelings of the ruling family regarding the threat from Hashemite Iraq and from Israel would incline the Saudi government to help finance Arab arms deals from whichever source as long as Arab capabilities against Israel are thereby strengthened and/or Iraq’s plan for hegemony among the Arab states checked.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">VII. By-Products</p>
                        <p>27. Apart from the improved prospects for local Communists and the encouragement to neutralism in the Middle East arising from the Soviet-Egyptian arms deal, it is possible that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has in view the development of further contentions and difficulties in the Middle East. The appearance of a leftist trend in Syria, for example, would probably bring heavy pressures on the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> from Turkey and Iraq to permit intervention in Syria before the situation became irretrievable. This might confront the West with the choice of either permitting a serious increase in inter-Arab tensions or imperilling the Baghdad Pact structure. Furthermore, the greatly increased danger of arms races and armed conflicts in the area <pb xml:id="pg_586" n="586" facs="0614"/>resulting from the deal is likely both to set one part of the Arab world against the other and the Arab world as a whole against Israel. The fact that these basic cleavages in effect run at cross-purposes to each other is likely merely to add to the confusion and to the prospects of general deterioration that would probably offer much greater long run advantages to international Communism than would the pursuit by the Arab states of neutralist policies. It is possible that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will attempt both to exploit the “spirit of Geneva” and to disrupt the Western position in the Middle East by offering cancellation of the Egyptian arms deal in return for US withdrawal from the Dhahran base and the abandonment of British military arrangements with Jordan and Iraq. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> might also propose a stabilization of the Arab-Israeli situation by a quadripartite (US, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, France, <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>) guarantee.</p>

                        <p>On October 13, at the 261st Meeting of the National Security Council, with Vice President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> presiding, Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> requested the opportunity to comment on the situation in Iran, the possible repercussions of Iran’s adherence to the Baghdad Pact, and the Soviet Union’s reaction to Iran’s announcement that it would become a member of the Baghdad Pact subject to the agreement of the Iranian Parliament.</p>
                        <p>In addition to discussing the events that had transpired in Iran, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> reported that the Soviet Union had duplicated its offer of arms to Egypt by offering them as well to Saudi Arabia and Syria, both of whom had also asked the United States for additional weapons.</p>
                        <p>A brief discussion relating to the Arab-Israeli problem followed. The relevant portion of a memorandum of discussion, October 14, reads as follows:</p>
                        <p>“Turning to the Arab-Israeli problem, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he understood that a paper with recommended courses of action on this subject was in course of preparation in the National Security Council Planning Board but that progress on the paper had been poor. Turning to Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>, the Secretary said that he hoped we could get as much help on this problem from his people in the Joint Chiefs of Staff as possible. Had it not proved rather difficult to get such assistance from the Joint Chiefs of Staff people in the initial stages of the preparation of this report?</p>
                        <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName> broke in to state that while progress on the preparation of the report by the Planning Board had been difficult at the outset, it was now proving much easier and he anticipated that a paper would be ready for Council consideration at next week’s meeting.</p>
                        <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> continued that the heart of what we needed to study now with respect to the danger of war between Israel and the Arab States was what the United States could do in case it was unable to convince the world that one or another of the two antagonists was guilty of a clean-cut aggression. We also needed to know how vulnerable Egypt and Israel would be to a blockade and finally whether we could make use of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-committed U.S. forces without leaving <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> with the feeling that it was being wrecked.</p>
                        <p>“Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> assured Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> that the Joint Chiefs of Staff themselves had discussed the Arab-Israel problem. They had reached the conclusion that it would be relatively easy to establish and to maintain a maritime blockade. It would probably be also possible to establish an aerial blockade although there were no precedents to go on here. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> also expressed the view that we would not be obliged, in the contingency of war between Israel and the Arab States, to go as far as instituting an aerial blockade.” (Eisenhower Library, Whitman File, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Records)</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> stopped in Rome on October 14 before proceeding to the United States.</note> Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>’s talks with Israel Prime Minister and Finance Minister and their staffs went very well.<note n="3" xml:id="d338fn3">No other record of these meetings has been found in Department of State files.</note> On technical side the two ministers indicated, although reluctantly and after some discussion, that the compromise proposal of dividing the salt water 50–50 between Arab States and Israel would be acceptable to them although, in view of the uncertain status project on the Arab side, they do not plan formally to submit it to the new Cabinet at this time. It thus appears that informally both Israel and the Arab States have reached a common basis on a water settlement formula and that the sole but formidable remaining obstacle is to obtain Arab concurrence at the political level.</p>
                        <p>In the earlier discussion yesterday, both <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> and Eshkol took position that, having reached agreement with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>, and two years having elapsed since negotiations commenced, Israel should regard itself as free to proceed with its work at Bnat Yaacov. After <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> had discussed political implications of this and the assurances which had been given him by <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> and other political leaders on Arab side that Arab states could be brought within two or three months to point of agreeing to plan, the Israel Ministers finally agreed to defer resumption of work for temporary period. Finance Minister Eshkol talked in terms of similar two or three months period, but in subsequent conversation with <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> was assured that work at Bnat Yaacov would not be resumed until March 1 and that if an agreement with Arabs was a real prospect at that time, resumption of work might be deferred for short additional period. Both <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> and Eshkol expressed skepticism regarding sincerity of Arab desires for water settlement and emphasized the firm intention of <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to proceed with Israel’s water program should Arabs fail to give political concurrence to technical understanding within period indicated. Eshkol expressed hope that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would give moral and material assistance to Israel in proceeding with its unilateral water development should Arabs fail to accept the plan within time <pb xml:id="pg_590" n="590" facs="0618"/>limitation. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> replied he would submit Finance Minister’s request to Secretary and other US Government officials upon his return to Washington.</p>

                        <p>359. Rome for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>. In course conversation yesterday evening on water plan, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> took opportunity to inquire of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> latter’s view as to how problem Soviet arms to Egypt should be met.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> must go; that he was unreliable and troublemaker as indicated by his activities in the Sudan, in North Africa and in the Middle East; and that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had returned from Bandung with a swelled head and inflated idea of his position and importance. He concluded that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> must be destroyed.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> said there were the following four possible means of coping with Soviet arms aid program:</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_591" n="591" facs="0619"/>
                        <p>1. The US could deal directly with Soviet Union to force her to abandon her program. When <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> pointed out that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> confrontation Soviets other cases, such as Berlin airlift, Korea and Western Europe had required presence US forces and inquired how that pattern could be followed in this area, <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> replied this was problem <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would have to work out.</p>
                        <p>2. As second alternative, the Prime Minister said, although he did not necessarily agree, many people in Israel advocated a preventive war against Egypt. These people believed that Soviet arms should be destroyed, either en route or upon arrival, before they could be put into use by Egypt. (Embassy despatch 259 October 8).<note n="2" xml:id="d339fn2">The Embassy in Tel Aviv reported in despatch 259 that Cyrus Sulzberger of the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>, in an off-the-record interview with <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>, had asked <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> what Israel’s response would be if the Egyptians did receive large-scale arms deliveries, including MIG fighter aircraft, from the Soviet Union. <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>’s reply was that “we would have to smash them.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 774.56/10–855)</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> replied that he believed such a course action would involve entire area in war and that it would not be solution to Israel’s problems.</p>
                        <p>3. US could give Israel arms equivalent to those received by Egypt. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> inquired whether, in view population and other limitations, Israel would not soon reach the saturation point in ability utilize additional equipment.</p>
                        <p>4. Fourth alternative was for US to conclude security guarantee treaty with Israel. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> pointed out Soviets might respond with similar guarantee to Egypt, thus laying basis general conflagration.</p>
                        <p>When <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> inquired of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> as to latter’s ideas solution Soviet arms problem, <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> replied he held personal views this subject but, in view fact matter was outside his terms of reference, he did not feel justified in setting them forth to the Prime Minister.</p>

                        <p rend="center">Problem</p>
                        <p>1. To review the continuing validity of the courses of action set forth in paragraphs 10, 11, 12 and 13 of “Supplementary Statement of Policy on the Arab-Israeli Problem” contained in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5428, approved by the President on July 23, 1954, as a means of deterring major armed conflict between Israel and the Arab states in the light of the present and prospective situation in the Near East.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Analysis</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Changes in the Near Eastern Situation Since Mid-1954</p>
                        <p>2. The analysis of the Near Eastern situation on which the objectives and courses of action of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5428, including paragraphs 10, 11, 12 and 13 of the “Supplementary Statement”, were based foresaw increasing tension between Israel and the Arab states, possibly leading to major armed conflict, and increasing Soviet activity in the Near East directed toward courting and supporting the Arab states. The analysis did not, however, anticipate that the Soviet bloc would make large quantities of heavy military equipment available to the Arab states. The Soviet bloc has now agreed to supply sizable quantities of arms to Egypt and may make similar deals with other Arab states; and has informally indicated that it would be receptive if Israel should seek to purchase Soviet bloc arms. The Western powers no longer exclusively control the means of maintaining an arms balance between the Arabs and Israelis. The new Soviet initiative has serious implications for (a) the Israeli-Arab conflict and (b) the Soviet influence in the area. This paper deals only with the first aspect. The broader review of U.S. policy toward the Near East is now under way.</p>
                        <p>3. The Soviet-Egyptian arms deal has substantially increased the risk that Israel will launch a “preventive war.” Such Israeli action is not likely within the next few weeks. The Israelis will probably wish to determine more precisely the magnitude of the threat posed by Soviet bloc willingness to arm the Arabs, to exploit the favorable trend of Western public opinion, and, most importantly, to determine how far Israel can realistically depend on Western and particularly <pb xml:id="pg_594" n="594" facs="0622"/>U.S. support in maintaining its territorial integrity. In the absence of convincing evidence of Western determination to preserve the territorial status quo against change by force, there is very real danger that Israel will undertake “preventive war,” possibly in the next few months, and it would almost certainly be more willing to take risks which could touch off a new round of hostilities. An Israeli “preventive war” may start in the form of border raids where responsibilities and intentions may initially be obscure. (Paragraph A of Conclusions of <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> 30–3–55).</p>
                        <p>4. Assuming that it is actually implemented the arms deal is likely to strengthen a tendency toward Egyptian militancy, and increase the danger that local clashes will develop into large-scale fighting. However, pending absorption of the new equipment Egypt will probably feel constrained to avoid serious difficulties with Israel. Over the longer run, the growth of Egyptian military strength will almost certainly stimulate some Egyptian interest in a “second round” against Israel. (Paragraph B of Conclusions of <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> 30–3–55).</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Effect of Changed Situation on U.S. Objectives</p>
                        <p>5. The analysis in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5428 led to the conclusion that major armed conflict between Israel and the Arab states would be inimical to U.S. national security interests. This conclusion is reflected in the stated objective of deterring armed attack by Israel or the Arab states. (Paragraph 9–a of the “Supplementary Statement”). It has been argued that the Egyptian acceptance of Soviet bloc arms has so fundamentally changed the Near Eastern situation that it would now be in the U.S. interest if Israel won a “second round” of Arab-Israeli hostilities. This proposition must, however, be assessed in the light of the following considerations.</p>
                        <p>6. Should a “second round” occur in the near future, in which the U.S. simply let events take their course, an initial Israeli victory would be almost certain. Under these circumstances Israeli ability to seize and hold considerable portions of all its neighbors’ territories would be limited largely by its lack of reserve supplies and the probability of <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> intervention if Jordan were invaded. The effects of a “hands off” policy on the part of the U.S. would have an extremely adverse effect on its position in the Arab world and would retard U.S. efforts to build indigenous Middle East defense. (Paragraph C of Conclusions of <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> 30–3–55).</p>
                        <p>7. If the U.S. adopted a “hands off” policy in the event of an Israeli attack on its neighbors, it may be confidently predicted that Egypt and Syria would appeal to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for political and material support which the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has indicated it would provide. Jordan and Lebanon would presumably first look to the other Western powers <pb xml:id="pg_595" n="595" facs="0623"/>but if dissatisfied with their response might well turn to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Saudi Arabia and Iraq would be unlikely targets of Israeli invasion, but the former’s bitterly anti-Israel regime would make common cause with the invaded Arab states and would react strongly against the Western powers. Iraq might well succumb to anti-Western emotions and Arab pressures and withdraw from the Baghdad Pact. In the chaotic aftermath of an Israeli success, political conditions in Arab states would be ripe for Communist exploitation. A likely result would be to solidify the Arab world under Soviet political guidance and with further Soviet support.</p>
                        <p>8. It may be concluded, therefore, that although as a consequence of the introduction of Soviet bloc arms the risk of major armed conflict in the Near East is now more acute and more immediate, this change in the present and prospective situation in the area as compared with that prevailing and foreseen in mid-1954 is of degree rather than of kind. It is still and even more in the U.S. interest to deter major armed conflict between Israel and the Arab states.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Elements of an Effective Deterrent</p>
                        <p>9. The effectiveness of the deterrent to major armed conflict between Israel and the Arab states will depend on: the extent to which these states are persuaded that effective punitive measures will be applied; the prospect of firm <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action; the number of states that would apply deterrent measures; the economic, financial and military measures which the cooperating states are prepared to take; and whether both sides, but especially Israel, believe that their security can be achieved by measures other than a “preventive war.” U.S. determination to cooperate in preventing major armed conflict is the sine qua non of an effective deterrent. Given, in reasonable degree, the prospect of the deterrent factors mentioned, it is probable that neither Israel nor the Arab states would attempt armed measures to seize and hold territory outside their borders. If, nevertheless, either side should embark upon a preventive war, it would be in United States interest for action to be taken to compel the withdrawal of the aggressor’s forces. The continued holding of Arab territory by Israel (which is the more immediate danger) without Western action to compel withdrawal would alienate the entire Arab world from the West. The immediately succeeding paragraphs consider whether the courses of action outlined in paragraph 10 of the “Supplementary Statement” of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5428 could be put into effect quickly and would impel a Near Eastern state that had seized territory beyond its side of the Armistice Line of January 1, 1950, to withdraw its forces and relinquish such territory.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_596" n="596" facs="0624"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discontinuance of U.S. Government Aid</p>
                        <p>10. The Executive Branch of the U.S. Government could, of course, promptly stop the flow of U.S. aid to and withdraw its technical assistance personnel from Israel or any Arab state. This step would have a psychological effect. It would be more hurtful to Israel than to the Arab states, but it would not have sufficient impact on any of the area states to cause them to abandon seized territory.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Embargo on Trade With the U.S.</p>
                        <p>11. Statutory authority exists under the Export Control Act of 1949<note n="5" xml:id="d340fn5">For text of the Export Control Act of 1949, which became Public Law 11 on February 26, 1949, see 63 Stat. (pt. 1) 7.</note> and the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917<note n="6" xml:id="d340fn6">For text of the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, which became Public Law 91 on October 6, 1917, see 40 Stat. (pt. 1) 411.</note> promptly to embargo U.S. trade, including calls by U.S. ships and aircraft, with the Near Eastern states. As trade with the U.S. is not of major significance to the economies of any of these countries, except that Israel would have to find alternative sources for foodstuffs, this measure would not be particularly effective.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Blocking of Transfers of Funds From the U.S.</p>
                        <p>12. Authority exists under the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 promptly to block transfers of funds from the U.S. to the Near Eastern states. This measure would have extremely serious effects for Israel and would in time almost certainly force Israel to surrender seized territory. Unless other Western powers adopted similar measures, however, the Israelis might hold out for a considerable period during which the Communists would be exploiting the inevitable turmoil in the Arab world. Blocking would have little effect on the Arab states bordering Israel but would provide strong leverage on Iraq and Saudi Arabia.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Adoption of Foregoing Measures by Other Countries</p>
                        <p>13. Excepting Jordan, no Near Eastern state is receiving significant aid from western governments other than the U.S. The trade of the area with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and France is, however, of great importance and if an embargo by these countries and perhaps other Western powers could be brought about the economies of Israel and the contiguous Arab states would be seriously disrupted and critical shortages of such items as petroleum products would develop; it should be noted in this connection that Israel’s stockpile position is <pb xml:id="pg_597" n="597" facs="0625"/>better than that of its Arab neighbors. It is, of course, possible that the Soviet bloc and perhaps some other countries would continue to trade with the Arab states, and otherwise to render ineffective the control measures mentioned above; and it is also possible that such states would take the same action with respect to Israel. If this did not happen, an embargo by the Western powers would in time reduce Israel or any of the contiguous Arab states to surrender.</p>
                        <p>14. As most of the Arab states clear their international accounts through and have sizable funds on deposit in London, blocking action by the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would have marked adverse effects on their economies and would in time force them to capitulate. The effect of U.S. blocking of Israel would be reinforced if the Federal Republic of Germany ceased its reparations payments and the Union of South Africa blocked transfers of funds from its highly organized Jewish community.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Blockade</p>
                        <p>15. It would be desirable to establish a blockade as soon as possible after the outbreak of major armed conflict between Israel and one or more Arab states. Since a blockade would involve the use of military force, its legal basis would have to be found either in an appropriate <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution or in Congressional authorization. It should be possible to secure a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution in a matter of days and if advance consultation had enlisted Legislative Branch support for Executive Branch plans, to obtain Congressional authorization without undue delay. Even if a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution were obtained as a legal basis for the blockade, it would still be desirable to obtain Congressional authorization before applying the blockade.</p>
                        <p>16. A maritime blockade of Israel, surrounded by hostile states and with limited sea coasts, would be relatively simple and almost completely effective. Additionally, an aerial blockade, while unproved, would undoubtedly augment the maritime blockade. A full blockade would reinforce the effects of any trade embargo and blocking of transfers of funds and would almost certainly force Israel to surrender seized territory in a matter of months. Blockade of any one Arab state would present more difficult problems, because supplies could filter through from adjacent friendly countries, and the Soviet bloc might attempt to force the blockade. It is nevertheless probable that the blockade would be reasonably effective in minimizing the inflow of supplies, and it should in time bring about the capitulation of the Arab state affected.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_598" n="598" facs="0626"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Military Intervention</p>
                        <p>17. a. The most powerful and possibly the only effective deterrent to major armed conflict between Israel and the Arab states would be their conviction that aggression would be countered by the armed forces of the U.S. or other free world powers. The U.S. and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> have in the Mediterranean area and in Europe forces which could be brought to bear possibly within hours and certainly within a few days. If this power were applied promptly against troop concentrations, it might well check a major armed conflict before it was fairly launched. Air and naval intervention might be sufficient to accomplish the mission, but we cannot rule out the possibility of intervention on the ground. Failure to take all measures, required to check Israeli aggression, including armed intervention if necessary, would disastrously weaken the U.S. position among the Arabs.</p>
                        <p>b. On the other hand, armed intervention would have certain undesirable effects. It would put the U.S. in a disadvantageous position aggravating the maldeployment from which we now suffer and force the U.S. to expend manpower and ammunition against forces other than communist forces. If it became known that the United States was prepared to commit troops in this area, the Soviet bloc might well attempt to create a situation in the Near East or elsewhere which would force our hand to our disadvantage. If U.S. troops were committed against Israel, we could alienate Israel as well as cause adverse domestic reaction; on the other hand, in committing troops against any of the Arab states, there is grave danger of alienating all the Arab and Moslem nations.</p>
                        <p>c. In any event military intervention would have to be based either on <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action or on the request of the victim of aggression.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Action Prior to Hostilities</p>
                        <p>18. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> has a continuing responsibility for the situation in the Near East as Israel was established by <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action and the existing armistices and armistice lines between Israel and the contiguous Arab states were established under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> auspices. It is, therefore, necessary to consider whether early and additional <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action would serve to deter major armed conflict in the present situation of heightening tension. This action might consist of a Security Council or General Assembly resolution calling upon the parties to the Palestine Armistice Agreements to take all steps necessary to bring about order and tranquility, to continue the existing cease-fire in full force and to conform to their obligations under the armistice agreements and the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter not to resort to force. The resolution could also express the determination of the Council or the Assembly to take any requisite action in the event of a deterioration of the <pb xml:id="pg_599" n="599" facs="0627"/>situation and could set up subordinate instrumentalities and procedures for observing and reporting developments.</p>
                        <p>19. <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action of this type would focus world opinion on the present dangers in the Near East and might strengthen the more moderate and responsible elements in Israel and the Arab states. The instrumentalities and procedures established might also make it easier to determine responsibility for an outbreak should it occur. As against these advantages, an attempt to utilize the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in the present context and in the shadow of the Soviet bloc-Egyptian arms deal might well have the effect of drawing the Arab states and the Soviet bloc closer together, of leading Arab and Israeli representatives to take public positions even more extreme than in the past and of further inflaming the situation in the area. The resolution described would very probably be adopted, but it would add little to existing resolutions and would have slight deterrent effect. A more vigorous resolution looking toward the imposition of sanctions if major armed conflict should occur would have difficult passage in either the Security Council or the General Assembly. On balance and unless there are further developments which would alter the preceding adverse assessments, it does not appear that an attempt to obtain <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action at the present time would be constructive.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Action in the Event of Hostilities</p>
                        <p>20. If major armed conflict does break out, it should, of course, be possible to obtain a Security Council or General Assembly resolution calling upon (a) the parties to cease fire and to withdraw their forces behind the armistice lines and (b) all other member states to assist in re-establishing the status quo and to withhold support from the party or parties refusing to comply with the resolution. Such a resolution would provide a basis for the collective application of the sanctions of embargo on trade and blocking of transfers of funds previously discussed. It would also provide a basis for blockade or military intervention by the U.S. and other powers.</p>
                        <p>21. If it acted in the absence of a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution, the U.S. would expose itself to the charge of interference in the affairs of other nations, to an adverse reaction in world opinion, and to greatly increased enmity from the nation acted against. These adverse effects would be greatly intensified if hostilities followed a confused series of events tending to obscure the identity of the aggressor. Finally, failure to invoke the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would tend to impair its future effectiveness. On the other hand, under a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> might decide to tender armed forces for use in the area. While this would remove the onus of interference from the U.S., it would increase Soviet influence with either the Arab states or Israel and would give <pb xml:id="pg_600" n="600" facs="0628"/>the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> a stronger voice in Near East affairs. On balance, the risks of seeking a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution appear far more acceptable than the disadvantages of proceeding without one.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Collaboration With the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Other Western Powers</p>
                        <p>22. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> has been working closely with us in matters relating to the Arab-Israeli dispute, retains considerable influence in the Near East, and has armed forces in the area. We should as a matter of great urgency plan fully with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> for appropriate <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action, the application of economic sanctions, the establishment of blockade and such other military measures as are decided upon in the event of major armed conflict.</p>
                        <p>23. France is a party to the U.S.–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>–France Tripartite Declaration of May 26, 1950 and undoubtedly shares the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> desire to deter Arab-Israeli conflict. However, France has tended to pursue its own independent course in the Levant, is exceedingly unpopular among the Arabs because of its North African policies and could make no significant military contribution to quelling major armed conflict between Israelis and Arabs. Accordingly, we should not discuss blockade or military intervention with the French, but we could be reasonably forthright in consulting with them on the broad outlines of our plans for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action and economic sanctions. Some of this might well leak from the French to the Israelis, a development that would not necessarily be disadvantageous.</p>
                        <p>24. Paragraph 11 of the “Supplementary Statement” refers to collaboration with Turkey as well as the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and France. We should keep the Turks generally informed of our plans and urge them to use such influence as they possess among the Arabs and Israelis in the direction of peace.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Possibility of Unilateral US. Action</p>
                        <p>25. If despite all deterrent efforts major armed conflict should occur, there are situations in which we might wish to respond unilaterally. In a clear case of aggression we might choose to react immediately and in anticipation of subsequent and early <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action. Similarly if the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> for some presently unforeseeable reason should fail to act, we might decide to move alone. Even in these unlikely situations, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would almost certainly be willing to apply sanctions with us. Hence, although we should on principle not tie our hands against acting alone, the chances that we should find it necessary or desirable to exercise this freedom of action are slight.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_601" n="601" facs="0629"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Problem of Identifying the Aggressor</p>
                        <p>26. There is a strong probability that major armed conflict between Israel and one or more of the Arab states would develop in circumstances that would make it difficult to establish, particularly in the minds of the general public, the identity of the aggressor. This situation would make it more difficult to act unilaterally. However, once a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution had been adopted calling upon the parties to the struggle to withdraw behind the armistice lines, the identity of the party in defiance of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would quickly be established by non-compliance with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> directive. It would thereafter be possible to apply sanctions to the offending party. Should both parties stand in defiance of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> order, sanctions could be applied impartially to both, a situation which might have certain advantages from the U.S. point of view.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Informing Israel and the Arab States</p>
                        <p>27. We should seek an early opportunity to impress upon the governments of Israel and the Arab states, in accordance with Paragraph 12 of the “Supplementary Statement”, our determination: (a) to deter major armed conflict between them and to prevent any territorial change by force, and (b) to impose vigorous sanctions and to take such other action as may be necessary for this purpose. As regards Israel, it will be necessary to persuade the government that the U.S. determination is continuing and will provide a shield for Israel against aggression if and when the armed strength of the Arab states is significantly increased. As regards the Arab states, their governments must be persuaded that the U.S. can and will restrain Israeli expansionism. At the same time, the U.S. should emphasize its continued interest in constructive solutions of Near East problems.</p>
                        <p>28. These approaches to the Near Eastern governments can best be made within the framework of the Tripartite Declaration of May 26, 1950. It is neither necessary nor desirable that this Declaration be publicly reaffirmed, and even specific private reaffirmation can probably be avoided. It is only necessary to imply that the U.S. Government is still guided by the principles enumerated in that Declaration, would act accordingly in the event of major armed conflict, and if necessary would judge for itself where responsibility for the conflict lay. These private approaches should be supported by public statements of high U.S. officials on appropriate occasions stressing our concern over the Near Eastern situation, our conviction that any resort to force would have seriously adverse effects on all concerned and our continuing efforts to preserve the peace and to contribute to a solution of the area problems. The effects of our démarches would <pb xml:id="pg_602" n="602" facs="0630"/>be reinforced if the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> made parallel approaches at about the same time. French approaches to the Arab states would probably not be helpful, but France might exert some influence on the Israelis.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Enlisting Congressional Support</p>
                        <p>29. Unless Congressional opinion has been prepared in advance, substantial Congressional support may not be forthcoming for a program of deterring hostilities with the result that both Israelis and Arabs would question U.S. determination. The increased risk of major armed conflict between Israel and its Arab adversaries now makes it a matter of utmost urgency to undertake the consultations with Congressional leaders contemplated by Paragraph 13 of the “Supplementary Statement”. Any program of sanctions would require Congressional support, while blockade or military intervention would require Congressional authorization.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Conclusion</p>
                        <p>30. The foregoing analysis indicates that the basic approach outlined in the “Supplementary Statement” of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5428 is that best calculated to deter major armed conflict between Israel and one or more of the Arab states and, should such conflict occur, to bring about a restoration of the territorial status quo. However, recent developments in the area suggest the following proposed revisions in the Supplementary Statement of Policy in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5428.</p>

                        <p>The Egyptian Ambassador, in calling on the Secretary this noon, said that he had a message from Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>, the Egyptian Prime Minister, which covered the following points:</p>
                        <p>1. Egypt had been subject to many threats and provocations from Israel during recent years and Egypt itself had been in a weak position militarily. Egypt had endeavored without success to obtain arms; consequently when the Soviet Union had offered arms, Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had been unable to persuade his colleagues in the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> not to accept them. Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had, in effect, been powerless to prevent the conclusion of the Czech-Egyptian Arms Agreement.</p>
                        <p>2. Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> wished the Ambassador to say however that Egypt had no aggressive intentions against Israel whatsoever; Egypt wished merely to strengthen its armed forces.</p>
                        <p>3. The Czech-Egyptian Arms Agreement was a commercial transaction without any political provisions. It was a single transaction and did not require subsequent transactions.</p>
                        <p>4. Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> wanted to maintain the long-standing relations between Egypt and the United States and hoped that he would be able to strengthen them in the future.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary responded by expressing appreciation for Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s message conveyed by the Ambassador. The Secretary said that in all frankness he must state that he found it very disturbing the way developments were taking place. He pointed out that the Administration had tried very hard to conduct relations between Egypt and the United States in a fair and objective manner and pointed out a number of cooperative moves which the United States had made; among these he cited the following: The United States had worked to assist Egypt and Great Britain to reach a settlement regarding the Suez Base. These efforts had been made in spite of contrary views among Israelis and American Jews that a settlement of the Suez Base would increase difficulties between Egypt and Israel. The United States had extended substantial amounts of technical <pb xml:id="pg_605" n="605" facs="0633"/>assistance and economic development aid to Egypt. The United States had taken steps with others to prevent Israel from diverting the Jordan River at Banat Yaq’ub. Grant military aid had been offered to Egypt within the provisions of American legislation on this subject which many other great nations had found acceptable but which Egypt had chosen to refuse. A reimbursable military assistance agreement had been concluded with Egypt under which in June we had offered to sell Egypt a substantial quantity of arms. The United States had made sincere efforts to handle its cotton sales in such a way as to reduce difficulties for Egyptian cotton exporters. We had always been ready to extend help with respect to the High Aswan Dam.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary continued that the present shift by Egypt in its policy could not be described as a simple arms purchase. The conclusion of the Czech-Egyptian Arms Agreement had been accompanied by press and radio attacks on the United States from high places in Egypt. In view of this shift and these attacks and in the light of the various constructive moves which the United States, for its part, had made, the question arose whether Egypt wanted a continuance of good relations with the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Egyptian Ambassador replied that Egypt appreciated the help and the assistance which the United States had given it and repeated, in concluding the Czech-Egyptian Arms Agreement, Egypt was merely acting to defend itself and that the Agreement was a single commercial transaction without political overtones.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that he did not in any way question Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s sincerity. He realized that Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> was looking at it from an Egyptian point of view but he wanted to note at the same time that he, himself, had been studying the theory and practice of the Soviet Union all his life and he was convinced that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was plotting and planning to gain control of the Middle East. The Soviet Union was not interested in what would happen to Egypt or any other single state in the Middle East as long as the Soviet Union itself was able to exert its influence. The Soviet Union would be satisfied to see the Arabs commit suicide if it was in line with Soviet policy. The Secretary added that if the Egyptians thought that they would be able to outsmart the Soviet Union, he was very dubious about their success in this respect. He believed the Egyptians would find themselves playing the Russian game to their disadvantage. The Soviet Union wished to dominate the Middle East. The United States, on the other hand, did not wish to dominate the Middle East and, in fact, had consistently endeavored to help it as the various moves which we had made indicated. The Secretary again stated that, as he had said repeatedly and as he had informed <pb xml:id="pg_606" n="606" facs="0634"/>his colleagues from time to time, we regarded Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> as the outstanding leader in the Arab world.</p>
                        <p>The Egyptian Ambassador said that Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> and his colleagues were well aware of the dangers of international Communism in the Middle East. It was the Egyptian belief that they would be able to keep the situation under control and that they would be able to reduce the number of Soviet technicians to a minimum who would be needed under the Czech-Egyptian Agreement. The Czech-Egyptian Agreement was, as he had said before, a straight commercial transaction without political provisions.</p>
                        <p>The Egyptian Ambassador said he had a number of additional points which he wished to raise:</p>
                        <p>1. Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> was extremely anxious to take a constructive line in the Middle East and, to this end, had endeavored during recent meetings of the Arab League to push actively present plans for the Jordan River developed by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. Furthermore, Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> would cooperate to stabilize Syria. The Egyptian Ambassador added that he hoped good relations between Egypt and the United States would continue and that the United States would be able to move forward on one or more of the following items: 1) he hoped the United States would be able to help with regard to the High Aswan Dam. He said that two months ago the Russians had offered help and recently they had specifically promised material and technicians over a number of years at a cost of only 2% in interest.<note n="2" xml:id="d341fn2">See <ref target="#d321fn6">footnote 6, Document 321</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2). A continuation of technical assistance and economic aid.</p>
                        <p>3). Agreement to supply Egypt with 360,000 tons of grain under P.L. 480.</p>
                        <p>4). A second visit by the Secretary to the Near East or, alternatively, a visit by Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> to the United States.</p>
                        <p>5). Continuation of efforts by the United States to prevent Israel from engaging in preventive war against Egypt.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that the United States wished to continue its long and friendly relations with Egypt as indicated by the many constructive steps which the United States had already taken. He felt it necessary to point out, however, that the conclusion of the Czech-Egyptian Arms Agreement enormously complicated his task. It complicated his task with the other Arab states; with Israel; and with many groups in the United States, including American Jewry, which strongly supported Israel. The United States had from time to time made efforts to calm the situation between Israel and the Arab states and had specifically cautioned Israel against aggressive moves. He had spoken in terms of broad principles in his statement of August <pb xml:id="pg_607" n="607" facs="0635"/>26. The Arabs had regarded his statement as being favorable to Israel. The Secretary did not understand why this should be the case because <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName>, the Egyptian Foreign Minister, when discussing the possibility of a statement of this general substance, had thought it a good idea. The Secretary and his colleagues in this Administration had persevered in an objective and even-handed policy, but that it seemed to have come to naught. Many Jewish leaders in the United States now claimed that this Administration’s policy had failed. Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had his own problems but, the Secretary said, he had equally heavy ones. Now it was difficult to convince many Americans that an objective policy was right and it was equally difficult to convince other Americans that Israel should be pressed not to take action or should be prevented from taking action. What, the Secretary concluded, should he say to such critics?</p>
                        <p>The Egyptian Ambassador repeated his previous statement that Egypt had no aggressive intentions of any type against Israel. The Secretary replied that he was convinced that this statement could be made at the present moment but in the future, following the receipt of arms, different attitudes might prevail. In any event, it would be difficult to say who began the attack. In the final analysis, Egypt and the United States should not be working at cross purposes but should be working together.</p>
                        <p>The Egyptian Ambassador asked if the Secretary had any suggestions for the future. The Secretary replied that he could tell Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> that he did not question his sincerity in any way, but that he should realize that what Egypt had done made it extremely more difficult for the United States. The United States did not regard Egypt’s action in a vindictive spirit or with any animosity. The Secretary stated that he could not give any answer with respect to the various steps which the Ambassador had proposed other than to say that we were studying them. The U.S. still wished to be on the friendliest of relations with Egypt in the future as it had been in the past.<note n="3" xml:id="d341fn3">On October 20, the Department transmitted a summary of this conversation in Circular 263 to Amman, Baghdad, Beirut, Cairo, Jidda, Tel Aviv, London, Paris, Damascus, Ankara, and Tripoli.

                        <p> Although immediate motivation <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s acceptance Soviet arms was domestic pressure to strengthen Egypt in face “imminent Israeli threat”, fundamental factor behind Arab receptivity to Soviet offers is, as we stressed in penultimate paragraph Embassy telegram 694,<note n="3" xml:id="d342fn3">It reads in part as follows:<p>“In determining US policies in light this Soviet penetration, we think it of utmost importance we bear in mind fact that basic reason why US suffered this setback is because <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss>—and preponderant majority area leaders—had become convinced that US, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and French arms policy would have indefinitely relegated Arabs to inferior and therefore untenable military position vis-à-vis Israelis.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 101.21–NIS/10–955)</p>
                            </note> fundamental lack of confidence on part of <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> and preponderant majority area leaders in U.S. and other Western intentions toward Arabs regarding relations between Arabs and Israel. Arabs for many years have resented “pro-Israeli” Western stand but until Soviets were in position intervene on Arab side have been unable to express themselves concretely. Soviets have now given Arabs confidence that they can maintain a firm anti-Israeli stand for an indefinite period of time at same time preventing publicly their pentup frustrations against West. We believe it vital in assessing subsequent U.S. moves to counter Soviet offensive in Middle East that these facts be recognized. We assume U.S. does not intend to abandon Middle East to Soviets by default but feel that there is real risk in our doing so in absence fundamental reassessment our approach to Arab-Israeli problem. Alternative to such reassessment will in our opinion lead to growing identification of West with Israel which identification would be used with increasing effectiveness against U.S. efforts in area and against Iraqi membership in northern tier.</p>
                        <p>Thus importance of removing or at least substantially reducing Arab-Israeli problem assumes paramount importance since unless this is done we see no hope of establishing any substantial point of political interest in common, with which to “hold” or more correctly “win back” Arab States to attitude they held toward West in 1946. <pb xml:id="pg_609" n="609" facs="0637"/>It seems to us self-evident that Israel’s interest in this connection should be identical with that of U.S. Loss of strategic positions in Middle East would be extremely serious to West but isolation in face Soviet-armed and supported Arab States would constitute great danger to Israel and might well mean ultimate extinction.</p>
                        <p>Prior to February 28, Israeli attack on Gaza there had been reason believe <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> would welcome modus vivendi with Israel in order permit him devote primary attention to internal political and economic problems. However following signature Turk-Iraqi pact (which <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> visualized as preliminary to political offensive aimed at isolating Egypt from other Arab States and leaving her alone facing Israel) and as result Gaza attack (which convinced <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> Israeli action against Egypt of sufficient size to threaten stability his regime was possible at any time) <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s desire cooperate with West on Arab-Israeli settlement perceptively diminished. On contrary <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> adopted counter plan which involved building up Egypt militarily as quickly as possible and politically by opposition to additional Arab adherences to Turk-Iraqi pact. At same time <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> made clear it had not completely discarded possibility of settlement with Israel but on Egypt’s terms i.e. “defensible” land link through Negev with Jordan.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s arrangements with Soviet Bloc particularly if similar deals are made by Soviets with Syria and Saudis are unlikely to modify <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> attitude. On contrary there is much risk that if Arabs feel they can obtain effective military aid from Soviets that they will adopt uncompromising position based on 1947 resolutions as minimum. While there is no reason yet to reverse our earlier conclusion that Arabs in absence settlement would continue to harbor vague ideas about an eventual war of extermination against Israel, there is question that they believe that eventually increasing Arab military strength, continuation of blockade and, they hope, falling off of economic aid both public and private from the U.S. would bring about a situation where Israel would no longer present a serious threat to any part of Arab world in which case it could be ignored and eventually absorbed. Given this attitude it is obviously likely to be much more difficult for a peaceful settlement to be reached than was case when Israel out-gunned Arabs, but we believe it must be tried in interests of U.S. and of Israel itself. We exclude as detrimental our own and Israel’s interests, alternative of Israeli launched preventative war for reasons given para 3 of Embassy telegram 694.<note n="4" xml:id="d342fn4">It reads in part as follows:<p>“If such an attempt were successful we feel it would produce chaos in Middle East and in effect hand area to Russians on silver platter.” If Israeli attack were unsuccessful e.g. as result Russian intervention or long drawn out conflict which would necessarily involve Iraq, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia as well as Egypt Israelis position would be even worse. In latter case we would foresee pressures brought to bear in favor US intervention in support Israeli action which would be vigorously resisted by British and possibly other western European states who depend on Arab sources for oil supplies and who are wary of direct conflicts between US and Soviets. Resulting conflict would strain US relations with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies if carried too far.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.)</p>
                            </note>
                            <pb xml:id="pg_610" n="610" facs="0638"/>We assume Israel has no interest in other alternative to a formal settlement which we have outlined above.</p>
                        <p>Question therefore arises as to how to go about reaching settlement. In our opinion Secretary’s speech of August 26 still provides proper foundation this effort since it appears sufficiently responsive Arab requirements to permit Arab governments to reach settlement with Israel provided Israelis prepared to make substantial territorial concessions at least in Negev and possibly—if necessary—in regions Western Galilee and Tiberia.</p>
                        <p>We are of course aware from messages we have seen from Tel Aviv that settlement on these terms offers no attraction to Israel and indeed may well appear completely unacceptable to Israelis. However we think it necessary for Israel, United States and other Western States recognize fully new situation which created by Soviet offensive in this area. While in past we have apparently operated on hope Arabs in state of weakness could be persuaded accept settlement which would generally satisfy Israelis and their supporters in United States, change in Arab capabilities necessitates revision of this point of view. We should recognize that our objective now in seeking liquidate Arab-Israeli problem is not so much to find middle ground but to eliminate as quickly as possible situation which has so poisoned our relations with a vast area of primary strategic importance to West, that we are now in danger of losing it completely. It seems to us improbable that American public would be willing to hand over Western interests in area as a whole to Soviets in order to maintain small foot hold in an Israel threatened with armed attack from day to day, nor to satisfy demands of pressure group in American electorate.</p>
                        <p>Therefore we recommend Department consider approach designed to convince Israel that United States Government sees itself obliged either work now for basis of permanent Israel-Arab settlement or alternatively must reluctantly give Israel but secondary consideration pending achievement of wider free world objectives in <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> on which Israel’s very existence must in any case totally depend. To make United States efforts in favor settlement possible Israel must offer territorial concessions. Otherwise there is no hope of Arab consideration and United States, since February 28 attack and resultant Soviet arms deal, had no leverage to achieve Arab acceptance. In fact, Czechoslovakia arms deal—which may soon be adopted <pb xml:id="pg_611" n="611" facs="0639"/>also by Syria and perhaps by other Arab States—makes time short for this effort which United States Government would make pursuant Secretary’s offer August 26. Should Israel instead of signifying its acceptance this view point adopt policy of “preventive action” United States Government will move to restore situation, militarily if necessary, under principles of tripartite declaration (as it would if Arabs attacked), but in so doing it could not abate new and more determined hatred against Israel that would result from such Israeli action which would render permanent settlement out of question in our time.</p>
                        <p>We inclined believe that if Israel is willing to make move in direction settlement of Negev question, <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> at least would be receptive, although <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> and Arabs might adhere at least at outset to standard Arab position on Palestine settlement, that is settlement based mainly on fulfillment 1947 and subsequent United Nations resolutions re borders, refugees, Jerusalem etc. Since <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> wants land connection with Jordan by Israeli cession of most of Negev to Jordan, <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> would veto seek [<hi rend="italic">seeking</hi>] substantial modification 1947 partition scheme and might reasonably encourage Arab States to move away from these partition lines in favor of “compensatory” cession in Negev by Israel. Such settlement might we believe be politically possible for <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> by enabling him to represent it to Egyptian army and other Arab States as victory for Egyptian and Arab diplomacy. We cannot of course be sure that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> will seek conciliation even if Israelis were prepared to meet his territorial desires. We are however encouraged by his reported approach to Nuri Said this subject (Baghdad’s 76<note n="5" xml:id="d342fn5">Not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 774.56/10–755)</note>) and in any case believe we cannot afford to overlook what to us seems only way to meet basic issue facing us in this area.</p>
                        <p>If move is to be made to regularize Arab-Israeli relations and thereby remove greatest obstacle to good Arab-Western (and also Israeli-Western) relations, it must be taken as soon as possible, before Arabs become too strong to be willing to “recognize” Israel and before Israelis—in spite of our warnings—become desperate. Regrettable as it may seem, both we and Israelis must realize that Arabs no longer feel obligated make concessions, and that as time goes by they will be increasingly less willing to consider any form of settlement but will rely on superior numbers, increased armaments, and blockade to bring about Israel’s disappearance. At same time we cannot permit Israeli desperation involve us directly or indirectly in war against Arabs; there is no question whatever that Israeli attack would be interpreted throughout area as United States reply to Soviet arms deal. Our political, economic, and military interests in <pb xml:id="pg_612" n="612" facs="0640"/>Arab world are such that we cannot afford at this time to be pushed into role in which we support Israelis in hostilities against Soviet-backed Arab world.</p>
                        <p>Alternative we have proposed represents, we think, sound policy—in our interest and in that of Israel itself—which in spite of its difficulties offers best and perhaps only hope preventing continued deterioration in Middle East from which only Soviets can gain.</p>

                        <p>I said I wished to discuss certain aspects of the Near East situation which had political implications. We were in the present jam because the past Administration had always dealt with the area from a political standpoint and had tried to meet the wishes of the Zionists in this country and that had created a basic antagonism with the Arabs. That was what the Russians were now capitalizing on.</p>
                        <p>I said I thought it of the utmost importance for the welfare of the United States that we should get away from a political basis and try to develop a national non-partisan policy. Otherwise we would be apt to lose the whole area and possibly Africa, and this would be a major disaster for Western Europe as well as the United States. There was great danger that this matter would get into politics, particularly during the coming campaign, and that the Israelis would make some moves at that time which for political reasons it might seem to the advantage of some to back, but with disastrous consequences.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_613" n="613" facs="0641"/>
                        <p>I asked whether the group agreed that we should try to deal with this on a bipartisan basis and if so, how. I suggested we might try to get some Democrat to work on this topic in a consultative capacity, much as I had worked on the Japanese Peace Treaty.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President said he thought it was of the utmost importance to deal with the matter on a non-partisan basis, recognizing that it might alienate much of the Jewish vote. He felt we should try to get a bipartisan basis, but it was doubtful whether in fact this would work out. Other persons present expressed the view that whatever agreement on a major policy might be arrived at at the top level, this would not keep the matter out of politics at the district and precinct level.</p>
                        <p>The thought was that if I could get a Democrat in whom I had confidence and who had ability to hold the Democrats in line, this would be a good thing, but that it would be dangerous to take someone whom the Democrats themselves proposed as that would destroy the authority of the President and myself. They doubted whether there was anyone who could play in this situation a role comparable to that I had been able to play because of my qualifications and close relations with Vandenberg and Dewey.</p>
                        <p>I suggested that it might be possible to get someone acceptable to Senator <persName corresp="#p_GWF1">George</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Stevenson</persName>, and Harriman, but the general feeling was that this would be rather difficult and might expose us to having to work with somebody who did not feel a primary loyalty to the President and myself and did not accept the discipline necessary for the proper conduct of foreign affairs.</p>
                        <p>The suggestion was made that Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> might be used in this situation, but it was recognized that he could scarcely put himself under the order of the President and myself as executor of policy in the day to day conduct of foreign relations.</p>

                        <p>1. The Joint Chiefs of Staff submit herewith their views regarding a draft report on the above subject<note n="2" xml:id="d344fn2">See the enclosure to <ref target="#d340">Document 340</ref>.</note> by the National Security Council Planning Board for consideration by the Council at its meeting on Thursday, 20 October 1955.<note n="3" xml:id="d344fn3">See <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>.</note> In view of the limited time available for examination of this paper, the comments of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have been directed to the military aspects of the “Draft Revised Paragraphs for the Supplementary Statement of Policy in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5428” set forth on pages 20 and 21 of the report.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Subparagraph 10 d.</hi> The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that all possible measures short of military force should be taken to cause the aggressor state to desist and to withdraw within its own boundaries before resorting to a blockade in order to bring this about. However, they feel that the policy should be clear with respect to whether a blockade would or would not be imposed in the event that it appeared unlikely that economic action would end hostilities promptly. The Joint Chiefs of Staff would therefore favor neither of the bracketed phrases in this subparagraph and would recommend substitution of the following:</p>
                        <p>“d. If it appears that the foregoing actions are not likely to end the hostilities promptly, establish a blockade with Congressional authority.”</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Subparagraph 10 e.</hi> In the event of major armed conflict between Israel and the Arab States, forces engaged could number between four and five hundred thousand. To intervene successfully in an action of this magnitude would, under existing force levels, require large-scale withdrawal of forces from other commitments. While the Joint Chiefs of Staff do not rule out the possibility that a situation might develop which would impel military intervention by <pb xml:id="pg_615" n="615" facs="0643"/>the United States, they are of the opinion that a decision to take such action or to refrain from doing so should be made in the light of the conditions prevailing at that time. They would therefore favor the deletion of this subparagraph.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Other Action.</hi> The Joint Chiefs of Staff assume that the actions indicated under subparagraphs 10 f and g under this subtitle would either precede or be concurrent with the actions outlined in the preceding subparagraphs. For clarity they suggest that these other actions be included in a new paragraph 11 (subsequent paragraphs to be renumbered accordingly) to read as follows:</p>
                        <p>“11. The following actions should be taken either before or concurrent with measures outlined in paragraph 10:</p>
                        <p>“a. Urge other countries, as appropriate, to take action similar to that of the United States;</p>
                        <p>“b. Make every effort to secure United Nations sanction and support for all such actions.”</p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Paragraph 11.</hi> The Joint Chiefs of Staff are of the opinion that the combined planning for the military measures contemplated in paragraph 10 should take place only after it has been established that the United Kingdom, and possibly France and Turkey, are in general agreement with these measures and have indicated a willingness to participate in combined economic and military action pursuant thereto. Consequently, they recommend that old paragraph 11 be amended, and a new paragraph be inserted (subsequent paragraphs to be renumbered accordingly), as follows:</p>
                        <p>“12. In collaboration with the United Kingdom, and to the extent desirable and feasible with France and Turkey, develop plans to support the measures in subparagraphs 10 a, b, and c above.”</p>
                        <p>“13. Develop plans, as appropriate, to support military measures in paragraph 10 above; and, at such time later as it may be indicated that combined military action will be taken, collaborate in such planning with the United Kingdom and to the extent desirable with other nations.”</p>

                        <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Paragraph 12.</hi> The Joint Chiefs of Staff recognize that the timing and manner of disclosure of information, as envisaged in this paragraph, is primarily a matter of political tactics. However, to disclose the circumstances under which certain units of the Fleet would be diverted to a specific task might be unwise. Such a disclosure might also result in stockpiling in order to render a blockade less effective. For these reasons, the Joint Chiefs of Staff would prefer that any reference to military action be of a very general nature.</p>
                        <p>7. The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that, subject to the foregoing comments, you concur in the “Draft Revised Paragraphs.”</p>

                        <p>At the beginning of the afternoon session of the National Security Council, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he would like to comment briefly on the two hour meeting he had had between eleven and one o’clock with the legislative leaders of both parties.<note n="7" xml:id="d345fn7">A summary of this meeting that <persName>Dulles</persName> conducted with six Senators and eight Representatives is in Department of State, Secretary’s Memoranda of Conversation: Lot 64 D 199.</note> He said that he had briefed the Congressional leaders on the prospects and possibilities for the Geneva meeting of the Foreign Ministers.<note n="8" xml:id="d345fn8">For further documentation on the meetings of the Foreign Ministers of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union at Geneva, October 27–November 16, 1955, see volume V.</note> The briefing had gone off very well as even General <persName corresp="#p_PMGWBJ1">Persons</persName> had agreed and “<persName corresp="#p_PMGWBJ1">Jerry</persName>” <persName corresp="#p_PMGWBJ1">Persons</persName> was knowledgeable in these matters. Senators Clements and <persName corresp="#p_GWF1">George</persName> had both made nice statements of support, had raised no particular questions of substance and seemed to go along with the courses of action outlined by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>. Two courses of action with respect to the agenda item on contacts between East and West, it was agreed, might require Congressional action in the <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">shape</gloss> of amendments to the McCarran Act<note n="9" xml:id="d345fn9">Reference is to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which became Public Law 414 on June 27, 1952. For text, see 66 Stat. 163.</note> and the Agricultural Act.<note n="10" xml:id="d345fn10">Reference is to the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954.</note> The leaders had said that if I thought well of these proposed courses of action, it was all right to suggest them at the Geneva meeting, but of course that they could not speak for the Congress as a whole.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName> reminded the Council that the Director of Central Intelligence had postponed his briefing on the Near East until this afternoon in order that it might be taken up in connection with the Planning Board report on the subject which was to be <pb xml:id="pg_618" n="618" facs="0646"/>considered by the Council this afternoon. He then called on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> for his intelligence report.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> said that he had at hand a detailed play-byplay account of the origin and development of the arms deal between the Soviet Union and Egypt.<note n="11" xml:id="d345fn11">Not found.</note> He warned that this report was made on the basis of the highest classification of intelligence materials. He also pointed out that the intelligence community viewed what had happened in connection with the arms deal with the highest degree of gravity. Such Soviet maneuvers could easily have a devastating effect on the position of the Free World in the Near East.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> then proceeded to read his account of the development of the arms deal from its origins in March 1955. He followed this by a brief comment on approaches made by the Soviet Bloc to other Arab States than Egypt.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>’ report, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName> commenced to brief the Council on the background of the draft report, submitted by the Planning Board, as a revision of the “Supplementary Statement of Policy” set forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5428. (A copy of the brief along the lines of which Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> reported to the Council is included in the minutes of the meeting.)<note n="11" target="d345fn11">Not found.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> first read the objectives and courses of action in the existing statement of policy with respect to the tensions between Israel and the Arab States. He thereafter summarized the content of the draft report submitted by the Planning Board revising the earlier statement. The analysis, he pointed out, in the new draft had been formulated in the light of the recent Soviet maneuvers in the Near East. He concluded by reading the revised courses of action in Paragraphs 10 through 13 and explained the reasons underlying the splits in these paragraphs.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President addressed to Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> a question as to the effectiveness of a blockade in deterring or ending a war between Israel and the Arab States. Would such a blockade suffice or would the United States have to contemplate further action?</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> replied that in the case of Israel a blockade would probably prove very effective in a very short period of time. Israel simply did not have sufficient resources to fight for any considerable length of time. In the case of Egypt, the effect of a blockade would not be felt so quickly.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that he believed one of our difficulties might be that of insuring the support of the major countries for a blockade which we might establish. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> replied that, of <pb xml:id="pg_619" n="619" facs="0647"/>course, a blockade would have to be effective in order to be recognized. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> added that if the blockade were challenged, it would mean war.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> then stated that he wished to inform the members of the Council that he disagreed completely with the views of his representative on the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning Board<note n="12" xml:id="d345fn12">Andrew N. Overby.</note> with respect to the revised courses of action presented in the Planning Board revision.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> explained that he wished to inform the Council of the views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on the Planning Board report.<note n="13" xml:id="d345fn13">See <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note> He pointed out that there had not been sufficient time to circulate these views prior to the meeting and that he would therefore read them now. He stated that the Joint Chiefs of Staff took no issue with the non-military courses of action either in this paper or in the existing U.S. policy in the event of war between Israel and the Arab States. Nevertheless, the Joint Chiefs of Staff were concerned with the timing of the application of these non-military courses of action. With respect to Paragraph 10–d which dealt with the establishment of a blockade in the event of aggression by Israel or by one of the Arab States, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> stressed the view of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that all possible preventive measures should be taken before there was any resort to such a blockade but nevertheless the blockade action should be clearly set forth in the policy statement. The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended wording which indicated in sub-Paragraph 10–d that if it appears that the non-military courses of action are not likely to end the hostilities promptly, a blockade should be established with Congressional authority. The Joint Chiefs of Staff did not believe that the paragraph should read merely that the United States would consider the establishment of a blockade. As to sub-Paragraph 10–e which called for military intervention to end hostilities in the event that economic sanctions and blockade did not end the hostilities, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> pointed out that U.S. military intervention in the Near East would inevitably involve a very large withdrawal of U.S. military forces from other areas in the world to which they had been committed. Accordingly, the Joint Chiefs of Staff were opposed to any reference in this policy to the possibility of military intervention by the United States in a war between Israel and the Arab States. While it might be necessary to contemplate such intervention, the decision to do so or not to do so should be made in the light of the situation existing at the time. Meanwhile, the Joint Chiefs of Staff would <pb xml:id="pg_620" n="620" facs="0648"/>proceed to make military plans to enable the United States to meet such a contingency if it arose. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> indicated that the Joint Chiefs of Staff believed that the courses of action set forth in sub-Paragraphs 10–f and 10–g should either precede or be concurrent with the courses of action in sub-Paragraphs 10–a through 10–e.</p>
                        <p>As for Paragraph 11 which called for U.S. collaboration with the United Kingdom and other friendly countries in the development of military plans in support of the measures in Paragraph 10, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> explained that the Joint Chiefs of Staff believed that such collaboration by the United States should occur only after it has been clearly ascertained that these other countries will join with the United States in carrying out the courses of action in Paragraph 10. The Joint Chiefs also desired a clarification of the time phase during which our military people would discuss plans for joint military action with other nations. It was obvious that when we do get down to discussing military plans with other nations, knowledge of these plans would leak and become known widely.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Paragraph 12 which called on the United States to make known to Israel and to the individual Arab States the policy in Paragraph 10 at a time and in a way deemed most likely to deter resort to major hostilities by any of them, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> pointed out that such disclosure entailed certain serious disadvantages. In thus making known our policy, particularly with respect to military action, the disclosures should be made only in very general terms lest detailed knowledge of it reveal in advance our military movements and naval maneuvers. (A copy of the written views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from which Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> commented, are included in the minutes of the meeting.)</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> informed the Council that the policy problem to which the Council was now addressing itself was a heritage from the previous Democratic Administration which had dealt with the Arab-Israeli problem on a purely political basis. The views of the Departments of State and Defense had generally been overruled by the <persName corresp="#p_WGTD1">White</persName> House on purely domestic political grounds. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> cited an instance of this which occurred at Paris in 1948. The recommendations of General Marshall who was then Secretary of State had been overruled in such humiliating fashion that if General Marshall had not been a real patriot, he would have felt himself compelled to resign.</p>
                        <p>As a result of this method of handling the Arab-Israeli problem, we are now confronted with a situation which has never been accepted by the Arab States. Unless it can be settled, this situation will continue to be a source of very grave danger to the United States and to the Western World. Basically, close ties exist between the Arab World and the West. <gloss target="#t_ONE1">One</gloss> such obvious tie was religious. <pb xml:id="pg_621" n="621" facs="0649"/>The religious beliefs of the Arabs were incompatible with Communism. Beyond this there were strong economic ties represented by the oil resources of the various Arab States, particularly Saudi Arabia. Thus, while we have these two fundamental ties operating to keep the Arab and the Western Worlds together, the Israeli issue operates to keep them apart and is, moreover, a highly inflammable issue. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> predicted that this danger would never end until a real and a final settlement could be made along the lines of his own statement on the subject of August 26, 1955.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then pointed out that of course the present draft report did not deal with the broad sweep of U.S. policy for the Middle East as a whole. Such a report will be forthcoming from the Planning Board at a later time. The present report dealt strictly with the problem of Israel and its neighbors, especially Egypt, a problem now made critical by the recent Soviet arms moves. The basic U.S. purpose in dealing with this problem must be to prevent the situation from getting worse, and to explore every possible way toward an acceptable solution along the lines of the August 26 statement. The Soviet arms deal with Egypt, continued Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, does not exclude the possibility of achieving such a settlement even though the receipt of arms from the Soviet Bloc might well cause the Arabs to insist on a more favorable settlement from their point of view than they had been demanding heretofore. Moreover, the increased military resources of the Arab States might conceivably induce the Israelis now to make concessions in the direction of a settlement which they have not hitherto been willing to consider.</p>
                        <p>In the opinion of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> the principal obstacle to any genuine settlement of the quarrel between Israel and Egypt was the disposition of the Negev Triangle. Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasr</persName> professes that he is prepared to move to secure that portion of the Negev Triangle which would be necessary to provide a direct border and corridor between Egypt and its Arab neighbors. Difficult as this claim would make the settlement, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he did not exclude the possibility of achieving a permanent settlement in this area—a settlement which the national interests of the United States requires. Obviously, however, if the Soviets continue to throw fuel on the fire, achievement of such a settlement will become increasingly difficult. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> added that he did not think that it would be Soviet policy to keep adding fuel to the flames in the Near East. The Soviets were well aware of the influence of Judaism and Zionism throughout the world. If they had not been aware of this influence, they would have moved even sooner to stir up trouble for Israel.</p>
                        <p>The immediate problem which the United States faces is what to do in the face of certain practical problems and certain practical <pb xml:id="pg_622" n="622" facs="0650"/>questions which will require answer almost in a matter of hours. The Israelis have made known to us that they desire armaments sufficient to match those which the Egyptians will obtain from the Soviet Bloc and/or a security guarantee from the United States of the present armistice lines. Lacking one or both of these desiderata, they have implied that they might start a preventive war while still in a position to win it. An answer must be given by the United States to the Israelis within the next two or three days. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> was going to meet with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> in Paris shortly.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, for their part, the Egyptians are telling us that their arms deal with the Soviet Bloc does not portend an anti-Western policy nor a refusal to settle their dispute with Israel. The Egyptians say that all they want is to place themselves in a stronger defensive position and that they had purchased their arms where they could buy these arms most advantageously. The arms deal, therefore, had no political significance.</p>
                        <p>At this point Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> interrupted Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> as to the Israeli demands to which Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had just referred. In reply Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that in his statement of August 26, he had said that if both sides could reach agreement on a boundary, the United States might agree to undertake to guarantee such a boundary. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> warned that if the United States replies in the negative to the requests of the Israelis, mentioned above, the Administration would not be popular with certain elements in the community.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> inquired of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> whether if we agreed to do what the Israelis were asking, the result would not be a further increase in the mischievous activities of the Soviet Union. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that for the United States to sponsor an arms race between Israel and the Arab States would be a very futile action. For one thing, Israel, with its small territory and population could not absorb more than a certain amount of armaments, much less than the Arab States with their large territories and populations. He was, accordingly, inclined to feel that our best course of action is to assume that the arms deal between the Soviet Bloc and Egypt was a “one-shot affair” and reply in the negative to all three of Israel’s requests. While, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, he would not be adverse to seeing Israel get a certain amount of additional armament, he did not wish this to extend to the point where it looked as though the United States was participating in an arms race among the nations of the Near East. In any event, we would probably lose out in backing Israel because in the long run the Arab States can absorb much more armament.</p>
                        <p>As for the security guarantee sought by Israel, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> very much doubted its practicality. Such a U.S. guarantee of the <pb xml:id="pg_623" n="623" facs="0651"/>boundaries of Israel would, of course, have to be ratified by the U.S. Senate. Such ratification was unlikely although admittedly no one could predict what Congress might do in an election year. In any event, however, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> stated that it would be a severe strain on his own conscience to recommend any such guarantee to the Congress unless a boundary agreement had previously been reached between Israel and the Arab States. Finally, it was obvious that the United States must make clear to both sides of the fight that in some fashion or other, the United States would react against an act of aggression by either side even though it might be extremely difficult to discern which side had been the aggressor. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that we certainly have the capability of clamping down on Israel because of that country’s heavy financial dependence on the United States. While it would make us very unpopular thus to clamp down, it was hard to see how we could recommend any other course of action. What particularly troubled him, continued Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, is the absence of any comparable pressures which we could apply to Egypt. A blockade against Egypt or even financial sanctions applied to Egypt would, of course, cause most unfortunate repercussions throughout the entire Arab World. On this point Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> turning to Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> asked him whether he and the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning Board had considered another possibility; namely, the effect of an Arab blockade of Western Europe. He said, of course, that he was not referring to a physical blockade but to the possibility that the Arabs would shut off their oil exports on which Western Europe was so heavily dependent. While such an action would be suicidal for the Arabs, many of them were fanatics and were capable of such misguided action. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he felt that the present policy did not adequately weigh the consequences of Arab reaction to pressures which the Western World might place on Egypt.</p>
                        <p>As for the rest of the paper, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> explained that he could not attach very much importance to the disagreements on wording in sub-Paragraphs 10–d and 10–e. There was not much substance in the distinction between “considering” establishing a blockade or military intervention and “establishing” a blockade or intervening with military force. The reason for this was that you would have to consider and reconsider such courses of action when you go to Congress to request support for these courses of action.</p>
                        <p>Turning to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> asked just what was the real basic bone of contention between Israel and its Arab neighbors and how could the misunderstanding be fixed up.</p>
                        <p>In reply Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that the basic issues were three in number at the present time. The first issue concerned the fate of some 900,000 Arab refugees who had been driven from Palestine by <pb xml:id="pg_624" n="624" facs="0652"/>the Israelis. The Arabs were insisting that Israel take back these refugees and Israel refused to accept them. Since, as a matter of fact, the State of Israel was already packed-jammed with people, the demand of the Arabs for the resettlement of the refugees in Israel was altogether impossible to accept. Our proposed solution to this problem was for the United States to put up the money to irrigate existing lands in the Arab States and put these unfortunate refugees on the newly irrigated lands. The second bone of contention between Israel and the Arabs went back to the 1947 United Nations Resolution on Israel’s boundaries. The Arabs wished to go back to the boundaries established at that time but this would deprive Israel of considerable territories in the northern part of the State which they seized from the Arabs in the hostilities which followed the United Nations’ finding. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> did not believe that this Arab demand was practical either. The third issue was the disposition of the Negev area which was of very special interest to Egypt since Israel’s possession of the Negev Triangle deprived Egypt of land access to Saudi Arabia. The Egyptians, accordingly, want a slice of the Negev territory. This matter, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said, could be settled if the Israelis could be persuaded to give up a good portion of the Negev territory.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> interposed at this point to say that he was impelled to point out his own view that neither side to the Arab-Israeli dispute really desired a permanent solution. They were merely using the issues just analyzed by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> as a means of keeping their quarrel alive.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> expressed the belief that Israel desired to keep the Negev area because of its hopes that oil would be discovered there. He doubted very much if the Israelis really needed a port on the Gulf of Aqaba. After further discussion of this point the Vice President stated that it seemed to him that as far as courses of action 10–d and 10–e which called for a blockade or military intervention by the United States, even assuming that we could establish the identity of the aggressor, we would have “a hell of a time” getting Congressional support for sending U.S. forces to fight the Israelis. As far as the Vice President could see the only useful purpose served by sub-Paragraph 10–e was to use this as a threat to Israel and a deterrent but not certainly as a practical course of action which could be followed. As for sub-Paragraph 10–d, the Vice President expressed the opinion that it was pretty generally agreed that the immediate danger of aggression came from Israel and that the establishment of a blockade would be very effective action against Israel. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> expressed the opinion that the course of action in sub-Paragraph 10–c which would “prevent the direct or indirect transfer of funds or other assets subject to U.S. control” <pb xml:id="pg_625" n="625" facs="0653"/>would be in itself quite sufficient to stop Israeli aggression. Actually, a blockade of dollars would be more effective than a blockade by boats.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> stated that it seemed to him a singularly poor time for the Administration to have any policy paper on this subject at all. The existing policy on U.S. action in the event of war between Israel and the Arab States was now wholly “out of place”. As far as this proposed new draft was concerned, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> believed that the State Department was in the position simply to take the stand that we would prevent the outbreak of hostilities between Israel and the Arab States without stating at all how we would do this. This State Department position was all that we needed in the circumstances. To spell out what we would precisely do to deal with or prevent such a war inevitably meant that we would be closing doors on other courses of action which might prove useful. Meanwhile, if this simple position were adopted, there was nothing to prevent the Joint Chiefs of Staff from continuing to make military plans to meet any contingency which might arise.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> interposed to state that the Joint Chiefs of Staff had been directed under the existing policy in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5428 to develop military plans in collaboration with the United Kingdom and if feasible with other countries. They strongly objected and continued to object to concerting their military planning with the United Kingdom or any other country. What they needed therefore was a revision which would authorize unilateral U.S. military planning for the contingency of Arab-Israel hostilities.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> then forcefully reiterated the position he had taken above. He insisted that all that was required was that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> talk with the British and the French and try to find the opportune method, manner and time for getting a solution of the Arab-Israel problem by recourse to the United Nations and to achieve a territorial boundary settlement which might be expected, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, to quiet this strife down for at least a long period of time to come. Accordingly, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said he would omit all of the specific courses of action set forth in Paragraph 10.</p>
                        <p>At this point Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> arose and said that he must leave to go and talk with the Ambassador of Iraq and that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> would take over for him. Before leaving the room, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that while, in general, the present draft report was acceptable to him, he did not place much value on the courses of action in Paragraph 10–d and 10–e (calling for blockade and military intervention) except as things “to think about”. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> agreed with him that this was a situation which could not be covered by policy made ahead of the event.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_626" n="626" facs="0654"/>
                        <p>The Council agreed to what Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> proposed to say to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> in response to the demands which it was believed the Prime Minister would make on the Secretary when they meet in Paris.</p>
                        <p>After Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had left, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName> pointed out to the Council the problem with which it was now faced. <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5428 was approved Presidential policy. Accordingly, it would remain in effect unless the Council determined that the policy was invalid in part or in whole or, unless the proposed new policy was substituted with or without modification for <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5428. In short, the matter could not be left to the solution suggested by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> replied that the policy we have (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5428) was “no good”. We should get rid of it. It will do nothing but get us into trouble and its removal was the first thing to insure. As for a substitution, until we knew what we wanted to do there was no sense whatever in writing down another series of actions. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> repeated his conviction that it was enough for Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> to say to the Israeli Prime Minister what he has just been authorized to say.</p>
                        <p>On the contrary, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> said he was much opposed to this idea of abandoning any attempt to formulate a policy to deal with the Arab-Israel problem. He expressed the opinion that the Planning Board’s draft which the Council was now considering had been very responsive to the Council’s request. Moreover, he added that he warmly approved of the revisions suggested by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Accordingly, if the Council could now agree on a paper revised in the light of the proposals of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we would be much better off in the long run. Otherwise the Council would find itself entertaining different views as to what it had agreed to at this discussion. The Secretary of State had seemed to be willing to accept the revisions suggested by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> said he agreed with the Secretary.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> still insisted that a one-page paper simply authorizing the Secretary of State to say to the Israeli authorities what he had just told the Council he desired to say, and which would include authorization for the Joint Chiefs of Staff to proceed to make their military plans, was really all that was necessary and feasible at this time. Emphatically, specific courses of action should not be included as a means of insuring a deterrent to warfare. It would be a terrible mistake to specify such courses of action. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> then read to the Council a very short restatement of Paragraph 10 which he believed would meet the point made by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>.<note n="14" xml:id="d345fn14">Not found.</note> Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that this confined <pb xml:id="pg_627" n="627" facs="0655"/>itself to listing the things that the Secretary of State and the Joint Chiefs of Staff wanted to say and to do.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President then called on Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> to explain to the Council what the State Department might need by way of authorization for the Secretary of State to respond to the Israeli demands. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> replied that any paper adopted by the Council should contain courses of action which would cover ultimate possibilities and alternatives. The Secretary of State wanted to be in a position to state to the Israelis that we would not sell them arms or provide them with funds with which to buy arms elsewhere. Thirdly, and finally, that we believed that the Israeli Government must go ahead and attempt to work out a solution. Meanwhile, we would see to it that the Egyptians do not start anything if the Israelis themselves avoid a preventive war.</p>
                        <p>The above statement by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> of what Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> wished to say to the Israeli authorities seemed to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> to omit one important point that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had made; namely, that the United States would make no guarantee of the borders of Israel unless and until a boundary settlement had been achieved with the Arabs.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> then again called attention to his own one-page solution. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> said he took no particular exception to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s paper as such, but that the Council should realize that <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> policy statements constituted the guides to action for all the operating departments and agencies of the Government. Accordingly, by inference, the proposals of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> and of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> could not be a reasonable substitute for a full policy paper. Accordingly, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> recommended that the draft report presented by the Planning Board should be adopted with such modifications as the Council deemed desirable.</p>
                        <p>In response to a complaint by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> that the policy reports presented to the Council by the Planning Board were always too long and involved, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName> pointed out that the length of the present draft was occasioned by the inclusion of a detailed analysis of the problem. As far as the U.S. objectives and courses of action were concerned, these took up little more than a page in the Planning Board report. He went on to warn that if the Council now chose to invalidate a Presidentially approved existing policy, it was under obligation to accept a substitute for the existing policy. Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> also pointed out that the economic sanctions listed in sub-Paragraphs 10–a, b, and c were actions which could be taken by the Executive Branch of the Government acting alone and on its own initiative. Admittedly, the military courses of action in sub-Paragraphs 10–d and e would require Congressional support or Congressional authorization. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> replied by stating <pb xml:id="pg_628" n="628" facs="0656"/>that he not only disapproved of the proposed military courses of action, he likewise disapproved of the economic sanctions set forth in sub-Paragraphs 10–a, b and c. There was simply no occasion whatsoever for listing these courses of action.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President commented that in his view the National Security Council had reached an impasse in its consideration of this policy. In point of fact it could not agree on precisely what the Secretary of State had a few moments ago said that he wanted to say to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> in Paris. The Vice President said he was quite sure that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had expressed a willingness to go along with the economic sanctions set forth in sub-Paragraphs a, b and c but that he would substitute for the specific military action described in sub-Paragraphs d and e a generally-worded statement of willingness to undertake further action necessary to deter aggression and prevent war between Israel and the Arab States. If his understanding was correct, the Vice President could not see why the Council should not accept sub-Paragraphs 10–a, b and c and request the Planning Board to revise sub-Paragraphs 10–d and e along the lines suggested by the Secretary of State and by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and present this revised statement to the National Security Council in its meeting next week.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said he strongly objected to this approach to the problem. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> also expressed doubt as to whether Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> would wish to follow the course of action set forth in Paragraph 13 which read “as a matter of urgency enlist Congressional support for the measures in Paragraphs 10 and 12 above.” Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> commented that in his opinion this was just about the last thing on earth that we would want to do.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> expressed very grave anxiety as to the dangerous course of action the Israeli Government might decide to take after Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> talked with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> and gave him negative answers to his request. In such a situation the departments and agencies of the U.S. Government ought to know how to plan for what might transpire. Such difficult problems as this should certainly not be played entirely by ear. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said that supposing that, after Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> talked with the Israeli Prime Minister and turned down his demands and that <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> then said that the Israelis would have to consider a preventive war, the Secretary of State might feel obliged to issue a warning to <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>. He might even want to be very specific as to the terms of the warning but in any case it would have to be a strong general statement. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> commented that the less the Prime Minister knew about what specific actions the United States was planning, the better it would be.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_629" n="629" facs="0657"/>
                        <p>After further discussion and a calling for a consensus by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName>, the Vice President felt able to state that in his opinion the Council had reached a consensus. It had agreed to make all of the actions in Paragraph 10 permissive rather than directive and had changed the introductory language in this sense. The Council had also agreed to recommend adoption of the economic sanctions set forth in sub-Paragraphs 10–a, b and c in the light of the permissive character of the paragraph as a whole. As for sub-Paragraphs d and e these were to be returned to the Planning Board to be revised in the light of the views expressed in the discussion. As for Paragraph 13, it was agreed that this should be revised to remove the suggestion of immediate resort to Congress for support of the courses of action which were proposed.</p>
                        <p>At the end of the meeting Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> pointed out that in view of the President’s absence and in view of the approaching interview between Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>, the Council’s Record of Action should show that the Secretary of State had been authorized by the Council to state to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> the position which had been outlined earlier at this meeting.</p>

To facilitate conduct diplomatic business, Ambassadors would suggest that they work out with Foreign Minister an arrangement whereby latter would make periodic visits to Tel Aviv perhaps once weekly and not less often than once a fortnight.</p>
                        <p>2. In advising Prime Minister of our acceptance <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>’s offer, Ambassadors would point out that our position relative to ultimate settlement of Jerusalem problem remained unchanged.</p>
                        <p>3. Ambassadors would also recall <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>’s undertaking that there would be no publicity regarding new arrangement.</p>
                        <p>4. Ambassadors would be authorized make calls at Foreign Ministry in their discretion when business with which they were entrusted was of sufficient importance warrant such calls.</p>
                        <p>5. Acceptance social invitations in Jerusalem would be left discretion Ambassadors under conditions which presently apply.</p>
                        <p>6. Dept continues feel that support of agreed position from other friendly powers should be sought in first instance by Ambassadors in Tel Aviv. Would not object however if <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and French wish to take additional action in capitals of countries concerned.</p>
                        <p>While 2 above represents present official position of 3 governments it is not intended to derogate from statement in August 26 speech that US Government would be willing, inter alia, reexamine question status of Jerusalem.<note n="4" xml:id="d346fn4">The Embassy delivered the Department’s proposal in memorandum form to the British Foreign Office on October 21.

                        <p>1602. From <persName corresp="#p_FAB1">Foster</persName>. During temporary absence of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AWW1">Aldrich</persName> from London this afternoon <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> sent for me urgently and expressed in strong terms his personal interest in proposals concerning the High Dam in Egypt which <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> was instructed today to discuss in Washington “at the highest possible level as soon as possible”. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> will see Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AWW1">Aldrich</persName> at noon tomorrow to reiterate his views but meanwhile he wished me, in view urgency situation, to send this message.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister said he knew Washington shared <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss>’s increasingly grave concern over Middle Eastern situation, which had been subject of a number recent Cabinet meetings. He thought Russian arms offers were most sinister event in East-West conflict since Soviets took over Czechoslovakia. He saw no solution for the West in trying to out bid Soviets with still greater arms offers. As to Egypt, he did not know whether United States might have reached point of feeling that in view <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s present position United States could give Egypt nothing further. I interjected to say I was sure United States had not reached such a point but on contrary was giving very active consideration to possible means countering Soviet arms program.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister then outlined proposals regarding High Dam as communicated to <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> today and gave me copy <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>’s telegram to <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName>.

                        <p>Prime Minister said that <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> planned discuss proposals with Secretary in Paris next week.<note n="3" xml:id="d347fn3">Prior to the convening of the Geneva Meeting of Foreign Ministers on October 27, <persName>Dulles</persName> was in Rome and then in Paris, October 22–26.</note> He supposed that in view Secretary’s trip to Denver<note n="4" xml:id="d347fn4">According to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ Appointment Book, the Secretary visited the President in Denver on the morning of October 19.

                            </note> following is text <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>’s secret message to <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> today:</p>
                        <p>“I am much concerned about the need for prompt action to forestall any move by the Russians to undertake the construction and financing of the High Dam. Coming on top of the recent Czech sales of arms to Egypt, this would be a serious blow to Western prestige and influence in the Middle East and might mean that the Russians would come to exercise a preponderating influence politically and economically in what is to us, both strategically and economically, a vital area.</p>
                        <p>2. As you know, negotiations have been going on for about a year between the Egyptian Government and an Anglo-French-German consortium. Their object has been to conclude a contract for the building of the Dam and the Associated Hydro-Electric Works. The total cost of this is estimated to be at least pounds 250 million, but the foreign exchange cost covering the work to be done by the consortium is estimated at pounds 100–140 million. This would be divided between the three participants and the United Kingdom firms (English Electric and others) would therefore be contracting for work costing pounds 33–46 million. A schedule of payments has been worked out covering the first 10 years of the project which provides for a maximum credit element of pounds 15 million, to be repaid within 4 years from the completion of the work. The companies concerned are willing to put up credit for this amount provided <pb xml:id="pg_634" n="634" facs="0662"/>that Her Majesty’s Government, through the Export Credit Guarantee Department, will guarantee repayment.</p>
                        <p>3. The report which has recently been presented by the International Bank Mission shows that the project is technically and economically sound. It expresses the view that Egypt should from her own resources be able to finance all but about half of the foreign exchange cost, provided that she exercises careful fiscal and economic policies and tailors the rest of her development programme severely. The implication of this is that something of the order of pounds 50–70 million would have to be found from outside Egypt.</p>
                        <p>4. Apparently the Egyptians have not yet actually asked for an International Bank loan for the project. As you know, the President of the International Bank<note n="3" xml:id="d348fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Eugene R. Black</persName>.</note> has made it clear that if the Bank were to make a loan, it would only be on the basis that the project was put out to international tender and was fully supervised by the International Bank from the beginning.</p>
                        <p>5. I understand that the Egyptian Government will shortly send representatives to Washington to carry on technical discussions about the High Dam project, so that further progress can be made when the Egyptian Minister of Finance visits the U.S.A. in the middle of November.</p>
                        <p>6. I see two main difficulties in relying on the participation of the International Bank in the project. The first is the delay. The Bank will expect to follow their usual thorough and careful methods and will wish to put the project out to international tender. All this will take time, and in the meantime the Russians may get in ahead of us. The second is that if international tenders are called for it will not be possible to exclude the Russians or their satellites from the bidding. I attach more importance to the first. We may perhaps be able to rely on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> to find a way round the second.</p>
                        <p>7. I have considered whether as an alternative the consortium could not go ahead and endeavor to conclude the contract without waiting for the conclusion of negotiations with the International Bank. The difficulties here are, first the risk that to do so might prejudice our relations with the Bank in the future, secondly the serious financial burden we should have to shoulder. The outlook for Egypt’s balance of payments is precarious with cotton prices at their present level. We estimate that after taking account of all Egypt’s foreign exchange resources (including her sterling balances) and setting against them her need for foreign exchange over the next 10 years (including the cost of the Dam) there would be a shortfall of at least pounds 50 million. But this assumes that Egypt manages her economic policy prudently and sensibly and that she is willing <pb xml:id="pg_635" n="635" facs="0663"/>to cut down the rest of her development programme. It also assumes that she spends say pounds 50 million on arms purchases, an amount which appears likely to be substantially exceeded.</p>
                        <p>8. There is a great risk therefore that Egypt might default on a substantial part of the payment due under the contract. It may be argued that in practice Her Majesty’s Government would not be at risk for as much as pounds 33–46 million, since if default occurred some part of the payments would have been made already and not all the expenditure would have been incurred by the contractors. But we should then have to decide whether to let the whole project come to grief and, if not, what we should do if the French and German Governments would not put up any more money.</p>
                        <p>9. Having regard to all the other overseas commitments, present and prospective, with which we are faced, I am bound to agree with the Chancellor<note n="4" xml:id="d348fn4">Chancellor of the Exchequer <persName corresp="#p_BRA1">Richard A. Butler</persName>.</note> that in our present balance of payments situation, it would be a heavy risk for us to take to underwrite our share of the consortium’s risks unless there is a prospect of some further assistance for Egypt from some other quarter.</p>
                        <p>10. If the International Bank must be ruled out on grounds of urgency, can we look to the prospects of further economic aid for Egypt from the American Government? And if so, would the administration be prepared to see the consortium go ahead and conclude the contract as quickly as possible, on the ground that only by that means have we a chance of forestalling the Russians. Prime Minister and Cabinet feel that there is so much at stake in this order, that they very much hope this may be possible. They are also conscious that if there is delay consequences would be incalculable.</p>
                        <p>11. Alternatively, is there any hope that because of the overriding need to conclude a contract urgently the Bank would agree to participate even if the consortium had gone ahead and concluded a contract with the Egyptians? It looks as if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> would be hard to convince that this was necessary. Moreover, we have ourselves been foremost in pressing for the principle of international tender, and there would be great risks for us in proposing that it should be ignored in this instance. Nevertheless, if the United States administration agree with us about the extreme importance of this case, they might be prepared to support us in urging Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> that it should be treated as being altogether exceptional.</p>
                        <p>12. I should therefore like you to discuss this whole question at the highest possible level as soon as possible, making it clear that I shall wish to raise the matter with Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> in Paris next week. Our object is, as you will see, first to find out what prospects there are of further American economic aid to Egypt on a scale which <pb xml:id="pg_636" n="636" facs="0664"/>would give us reasonable security that they would not default on their payments under the contract. Secondly, to ensure that if the consortium went ahead they would do so with sympathy and support not only of the United States administration but of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> and the International Bank, and finally to ascertain whether there would be any possibility of the International Bank participating by some method which would not involve too much delay”.</p>

                        <p>Thank you for your message of October 5<note n="5" xml:id="d349fn5">See <ref target="#d324fn2">footnote 2, Document 324</ref>.</note> in which you expressed with all frankness your views on the deliveries of arms to Egypt.</p>
                        <p>We highly appreciate your concern for peace and fully share your desire to guarantee the preservation of peace in the region of the Near and Middle East. However, in this connection the decision of the Egyptians to purchase arms in Czechoslovakia is no cause for concern.</p>
                        <p>It is known that the Egyptian Republic has an army and also has heretofore received arms for it from other countries. It is understandable that in the interests of its own defense and the safeguarding of the country’s independence it needs arms in some quantity. It is natural that the Egyptian Republic desires to acquire these arms in exchange for the products of its own labor, not binding itself with any obligations whatever that might impair its sovereign rights. It is apparent from the statements of the Egyptian as well as Czechoslovak Governments that the contract concluded between them is of just that character. Moreover, there are no grounds for speaking in this instance of any arms race or for considering that these arms deliveries may lead to a violation of the peace.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, you well know that the United Kingdom and the United States of America over many years have been delivering at their own discretion considerable quantities of arms to various countries of the Middle and Near East. These arms are delivered, as a rule, under well known political conditions, for example, on condition of the participation of the countries purchasing arms in definite military groupings aimed against other states, which actually leads to an armaments race. I should like to recall in this connection that the proposals for arms deliveries were made by the Western Powers to Egypt as well, on the condition of subordinating the Egyptian army to a so-called “Middle East Command”, or of the entry of Egypt into military groupings created there. If Egypt did not want to follow this road and is defending its national rights and legal interests, this should not give any cause for charges that it is allegedly not interested in the preservation of peace. At all events, <pb xml:id="pg_638" n="638" facs="0666"/>the Soviet Government has no grounds for thinking that Egypt is interested in preserving peace any less than any other state in this region.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, we share the desire expressed in your letter that the great powers which bear special responsibility for the preservation of universal peace should show necessary concern for the lessening of tensions between Egypt and Israel and generally in this region. Achievement of these aims would contribute to a situation wherein all states of this region will have confidence in the inviolability of their rights and national interests. In this connection the achievement by us of joint successes also in settling the basic question of a general reduction of armaments would be of great importance.</p>
                        <p>I should like to hope that this reply of mine will contribute in some measure to dispel the apprehensions which you expressed.</p>

                        <p>400. Paris for <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName>. In my conversation with <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> today on eve his departure Lydda airport for Paris, I asked specifically what might be significance of Chief of Staff Dayan’s sudden recall from European vacation. I suggested there was certain to be active and widespread interpretation of this move in relation to rumors of Israel’s “preventive action” under certain conditions. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> told me definitely there was no such significance involved—that Dayan had been called back solely for purpose assisting in drawing up an arms purchasing program. He said Dayan was at that moment closeted with Cabinet which was engaged in very serious and unhappy task of deciding which categories of national budget funds must suffer diversion of money to be used for arms purchases. This was considered such an important and far reaching decision that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> deemed it necessary that Dayan participate in discussions. He then said “This <pb xml:id="pg_639" n="639" facs="0667"/>is not only a reason to be handed out by the government but it is an actual fact”.<note n="2" xml:id="d350fn2">Dayan later wrote that at a meeting with <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> on October 23 he received orders to initiate preparations for the capture of the Straits of Tiran to ensure freedom of shipping through the Gulf of Akaba and the Red <gloss target="#t_SEA1">Sea</gloss>.

                        <p>10A. In the event of major armed conflict between Israel and the Arab States, the U.S. should be prepared to take the following action against the state or states which are determined by a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> finding or, if necessary, by the U.S., to be responsible for the conflict or which refuse to withdraw their forces behind the Palestine Armistice line of 1950:</p>
                        <p>a. Discontinue U.S. Government aid.</p>
                        <p>b. Embargo U.S. trade.</p>
                        <p>c. Prevent the direct or indirect transfer of funds or other assets subject to U.S. control.</p>
                        <p>[d. If it appears that the foregoing actions are not likely to end the hostilities promptly, establish a blockade with Congressional authority.]<note n="8" xml:id="d351fn8">Defense–<gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> proposal. [Footnote and brackets appear in the source text.]</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>[10B. Because the actions in 10A, a, b and c may not be sufficient to end the hostilities promptly, study the desirability and feasibility of taking military action, including a blockade.]<note n="9" xml:id="d351fn9">State proposal. [Footnote and brackets appear in the source text.]</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>10C. The following actions should be taken either before or concurrent with measures outlined in paragraph 10A;</p>
                        <p>a. Urge other countries, as appropriate, to take action similar to that of the United States.</p>
                        <p>b. Make every effort to secure United Nations sanction and support for all such actions.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_641" n="641" facs="0669"/>
                        <p>11A. In collaboration with the United Kingdom, and to the extent desirable and feasible with France and Turkey, develop plans to support the measures in subparagraphs 10A, a, b, and c above.</p>
                        <p>11B. Develop plans unilaterally, as appropriate, to support the military action referred to above; and, at such time later as it may be indicated that combined military action will be taken, collaborate in such planning with the United Kingdom and to the extent desirable with other nations.</p>
                        <p>12. At a time and in a way he deems most likely to be effective, the Secretary of State should inform Israel and the Arab States privately that the United States, in accordance with existing policy, will seek to prevent resort to armed aggression by either Israel or the Arab States and, if it should occur, will seek to stop it quickly.</p>
                        <p>13. As appropriate, enlist Congressional support for the measures in the above paragraphs.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The purpose of my message was to draw your attention to the risks to peace which must flow from the supply of armaments to Egypt and Israel on a considerable scale. My present information suggests that the contemplated scale of deliveries to Egypt is very large. If fully carried out, these deliveries are sufficient to destroy any hope that an arms race between Egypt and Israel can be avoided. I cannot accept the view that because the contract is said to be without political conditions it therefore cannot lead to an arms race or to a breach of the peace.</p>
                        <p>I also find myself obliged to point out that, contrary to what is stated in Your Excellency’s message, Her Majesty’s Government have not imposed political conditions for the supply of arms to Egypt.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_643" n="643" facs="0671"/>
                        <p>We have tried to keep deliveries to both sides within limited proportions with the sole purpose of preventing an increase in tension. The sales of arms which have been authorized in recent years, both to Egypt and to Israel, for legitimate purposes of self-defence, have been made on a commercial basis and without political conditions of any sort. Allow me also to point out that my message to Your Excellency did not contain any accusation to the effect that Egypt is not interested—or is less interested than other states in the area—in securing peace.</p>
                        <p>I am glad to note your statement that the Soviet Government share our concern for lessening tension between Egypt and Israel. Her Majesty’s Government are no less anxious than the Soviet Government that all states in this area should be sure of the inviolability of their rights and national interests. They cannot agree, however, that these purposes will be served by the consignment to one party to the dispute of very large quantities of armaments. I cannot emphasise too strongly the dangerous consequences of such deliveries both in the area itself and in the general context of world tension.</p>
                        <p>I agree that joint success in solving the wider question of a general reduction of armaments would also be of great importance. But this does not absolve us from the duty of reducing the danger of war between these two countries, with all the unforeseeable consequences which that could involve.”</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_Tosec1">Tosec</gloss> 28. <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> and I discussed High Aswan Dam and related projects yesterday. It is clear that British, Egyptians, Sudanese, <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, including Congress, will need to be consulted and to agree on many points. We think agreement can be achieved but that it will require prior agreement between the British, <pb xml:id="pg_644" n="644" facs="0672"/>the Bank and ourselves before we approach the Egyptians and hope, as suggested in my earlier telegram, we can shortly begin talks here.</p>
                        <p>Whole project for High Aswan Dam shapes up in our tentative thinking along following lines:</p>
                        <p>Reduced to simplest terms High Aswan Dam seems to be useful enterprise, total cost of which with its related projects will aggregate, under present estimates, 1.3 billion dollars. Of this amount four hundred million dollars is required in foreign exchange and nine hundred million dollars in domestic funds in Egypt.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the 400 million dollars, <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> would be willing lend 200 million at rate of about 15 million dollars yearly provided Egyptians make proper arrangements to implement project, providing there is agreement with Sudan re Nile water and providing balance of 200 million dollars in foreign exchange can be found. With respect to this balance we estimate between 15 and 20 million dollars yearly will be needed for 15 years on grant basis. US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> will wish to assist in this respect providing Egyptians and Sudanese play their part. This amount would be in addition to other grant aid which US is now giving to Egypt. To start conversations we propose that <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would contribute one-third and US two-thirds of 200 million dollars. Approval of US Congress would be required. US contribution would be spent in US. <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> contribution would not be paid out of Egypt’s blocked sterling in London but out of other British funds.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the 900 million, Egypt would agree to make 60 million available yearly for 18 years in local currency for expenditure in Egypt.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> and I are planning to see <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> tomorrow and talk to him along lines indicated herein.<note n="2" xml:id="d354fn2">See <ref target="#d360">Document 360</ref>.</note>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. We share British concern threat posed by Soviet offer to construct High Aswan Dam and recognize desirability proposing some course action looking toward Western financing of project. Believe threat can be successfully met unless Egyptians impervious all tenets sound planning and implementing of project this type and Soviets completely disregard all commercial considerations. In such event doubt we in any position to compete. We cognizant danger of involving US in such long range project since inability carry through would damage our prestige and invite exploitation of situation by Soviets.</p>
                        <p>2. Bank’s engineers have just arrived Cairo at <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> request. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> is hopeful they will make significant progress in explaining proper role of consulting engineers for this project and in getting <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> understanding and acceptance. Engagement internationally recognized firm on terms acceptable to Bank could then follow. (British Foreign Office under impression Sir Alexander Gibb and partners already appointed.) <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> believes forthcoming talks with Kaissouni will also enable progress be made on other aspects of loan.</p>
                        <p>3. According <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>, preliminary study over-all cost of dam complex estimated £469.7 million ($1.3 billion) of which foreign exchange expenditures represent £142 million ($408 million); remainder of financing considered local currency costs. Whereas dam and power facilities may be constructed over period 10 years, irrigation and other land spreading phases will not be completed for 18 years. Since financing of project even with substantial outside help bound place great strain on Egypt’s resources, careful budgeting of resources, over-all planning and establishment of priorities for both armament and development expenditures will be necessary. If this is <pb xml:id="pg_646" n="646" facs="0674"/>done, Bank study indicates Egypt should be able finance about one-half foreign exchange component £71 million ($204 million) from own resources; this predicated among other things on continued foreign aid amounting at least £3.5 million ($10 million) annually and access to blocked sterling assets at faster rate than at present. We are doubtful that Egypt will in fact be able to make such large allocation of her own foreign exchange, and that over and above loan of at least $200 million approximately $200 million of foreign grant aid may be required during construction period to enable Egypt to successfully finance other essential requirements.</p>
                        <p>4. Re British proposal, para 2, London’s 1603, Dept observations as follows:</p>
                        <p>a) Figure given for total cost of project (around $720 million compared to Bank’s total estimated cost of $1.3 billion) appears cover only the dam, power installation and some water spreading phases but not entire project envisaged as essential by Bank in order to produce the necessary results in the Egyptian economy.</p>
                        <p>b) Since, according to Bank estimates, foreign exchange costs probably in excess £140 million, maximum figure in range suggested by British (£100–140 million) will be used in following analysis.</p>
                        <p>c) British group appears willing carry £l5 million for only 4 years beyond completion of work. However, much longer credit period is necessary due Egypt’s precarious balance of payments situation. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> talked with consortium members last month and believes consortium unable extend long term credits. <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> loan would presumably extend over 20–25 year period. Implication though not stated is that US would carry after the 4 year period in the consortium proposal.</p>
                        <p>d) Actually therefore assurance requested in para 12 <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> 1603 if accorded would obligate US assume ill defined and potentially large risks. Under most favorable conditions our obligation might not be greater than maximum credit element £l5 million mentioned para 2. This, however, leaves £31 million unaccounted for which according para 8 might conceivably (and probably would) come under default. Furthermore, if US assumes this obligation for Britain, we might well be asked to assume comparable French and German obligations aggregating around £94 million. In addition to project risks British wish us support Egyptian economy to at least £50 million (see para 7), which they regard as minimal since Egyptian expenditures on arms and ability to cut back outlays other development projects uncertain. As practical matter, identifiable liabilities which US might have to assume total £l90 million ($545 million). Commitment might conceivably involve US in financial obligations far beyond this figure, particularly were Egypt to engage in military undertakings during this period.</p>
                        <p>e) Aside from other considerations, we strongly doubt Congressional sentiment would support consortium approach unless American firms given opportunity to participate. <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> procedure of normal competitive bidding seems to us desirable.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_647" n="647" facs="0675"/>
                        <p>5. Department understands (from <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName>) that <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> would not be able participate under terms presently proposed by consortium. Bank requires contracting for construction through international competition and objects to consulting engineers participation such competition. Bank further requires 1) agreement between Egypt and Sudan on division of Nile waters and 2) assurances covering necessary financing over and above its own loans e.g. how will <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> procure and assure adequate local resources.</p>
                        <p>6. US Government believes international character <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and its experience gives best assurance to both <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> and to the West of successful project and that relations with respect to project will be kept amicable. Moreover, Bank virtually only source from which <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> can obtain adequate long term credits. No ordinary Bank or group of Banks would appear able underwrite project. <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> policy on tenders would conceivably reduce cost of project. <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> concern with Bank policy in this regard appears unfounded since Bank officials believe Eastern European countries would not be able to qualify.</p>
                        <p>7. Would seem to us what Egypt needs and wants is our assistance in removing obstacles which interfere with <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> financing. <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> could make most significant contribution by obtaining Sudan’s consent soonest to Egypt’s use at least additional 10 <gloss target="#t_MCM1">mcm</gloss> of Nile water. US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> could also contribute by assuring <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> their intention grant foreign exchange assistance necessary fill gap between total foreign exchange requirements and amount forthcoming from Bank. This would be over and above release <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> blocked sterling held by Egypt.</p>
                        <p>8. Proposed course of action:</p>
                        <p>a) <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and US would assure <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> that they will exercise best efforts to bring <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> negotiations to prompt and successful conclusion.</p>
                        <p>b) <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would immediately exert maximum influence with Sudan to reach an agreement with Egypt which will satisfactorily meet that country’s water requirements.</p>
                        <p>c) US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would, if developing situation requires, express intention, provided <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> shows constructive attitude towards <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> problems, to extend subject to continuing appropriations substantial grant economic aid over the next ten years. We would expect <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to assume about one-third this obligation over and above release Egyptian blocked sterling.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> at my request made through Foreign Office protocol this morning, received me at three p.m. Moscow time today in Kremlin.</p>
                        <p>I stated that under instructions I wished to deliver message from the President to him.</p>
                        <p>After he had had it translated to him I asked whether he had any preliminary oral message he wished me transmit. After asking interpreter to repeat slowly the translation second paragraph President’s letter, <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> spoke as follows:</p>
                        <p>He was appreciative of President’s very prompt reply to his own message<note n="3" xml:id="d356fn3">See <ref target="#d349">Document 349</ref>.</note> and was glad to know that Secretary had been asked to talk with <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> in detail. He said this exchange between Secretary and Foreign Minister should make issues clear in same spirit in which President and he had expressed themselves previously.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> nevertheless evinced surprise at importance attached this transaction between Czechoslovakia and Egypt. He said that in past United States and Western European countries had sold arms to different countries and that no concern had been expressed. For example arms had been sold Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Arabia until recently and there had been no reaction. But now he said so much “noise” is raised about this transaction. Furthermore, Egypt and Israel had bought arms in United States and United States had delivered arms to Egypt, including, he understood, tanks.</p>
                        <p>He then arrested himself and said that he would not enter further discussion of matter at this time. He repeated his thanks to President for quick reply and stated he was sorry that President in his present state health had to deal with such questions and concluded by requesting that I send his most sincere wishes for good health and fast recovery of President and his warm personal regards.</p>
                        <p>I said to Prime Minister that I was not in position to comment on what he had to say although I was sure that if he were properly informed the information in his possession and that in the President ’s <pb xml:id="pg_649" n="649" facs="0677"/>should not differ greatly and that I would merely transmit what he had to say together with his personal messages.</p>

A study undertaken at this time, with respect to military actions other than a blockade, would necessarily be based not only upon many imponderables but also upon the assumptions the validity of which would be open to question. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have previously pointed out that a decision to take such military action or to refrain from doing so should be made in the light of the situation then existing. The desirability and feasibility of such action would be taken into consideration in making that decision. For these reasons, the Joint Chiefs of Staff would recommend the deletion of this paragraph from the policy. This deletion would in no way affect the continuing planning function of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                        <p>5. The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that, subject to the foregoing comments, you concur in the draft revised paragraphs.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The Secretary opened the discussion by saying that Israel Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> had given us a preview of the position he intended to take in his discussions later that day with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> and the Secretary<note n="2" xml:id="d358fn2">See <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>.</note> by making a television recording for release in the United States at the very time he would be seeing the Secretary. We had received information that he would be saying on television that the Israel Government placed its principal reliance on the United States because Great Britain was already involved with Jordan and the French were preoccupied with Morocco. He would be saying that Israel wants: (1) long-term credit for arms sufficient to balance the Soviet arms to Egypt; (2) a security guarantee; and (3) pressure on the Soviet Union to desist from providing arms to the Arabs. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> indicated that if Israel is not given the first two it may have to strike first. The Secretary said that it would not be easy for the United States to give him nothing and still keep Israel quiet. The Israeli Government may gamble that regardless of what the Secretary may say, Jewish influence would be a deterrent to United States action against Israel. Also, Israel would have the support of those in the United States who want to take a tough line against the Soviet Union. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> commented that Israel might start a preventive action, counting on the International Community calling it off after a while. The Secretary said that it was difficult to see how there was anything decisive about any preventive action which Israel could take.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said that he thought he would take the following line with <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>: (1) he would listen sympathetically to anything <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> said; (2) Britain could give no unconditional guarantee beyond that contained in the 1950 Declaration; (3) Britain could not embark upon a policy of equating to Israel arms in whatever amount the Soviets might make available to the Arabs, but it would continue to permit shipments of some arms to Israel; (4) there is no future for Israel in the long run unless it makes peace with the Arabs. If the present situation continues only the Soviets will benefit. There must be concessions from both sides. A settlement is more important than village lands here or there. Israel should make concessions in the Negev in the form of border triangles or even relinquishing Elath.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he believed that might be a good line. Before he left Washington he had had a talk with the Iraqi Ambassador,<note n="3" xml:id="d358fn3">According to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ Appointment Book, <persName>Dulles</persName> and the Iraqi Ambassador, Moussa Al–Shabandar, met at 4 p.m., October 20. (Princeton University Library, Dulles Papers) The memorandum of this conversation is in Department of State, Secretary’s Memoranda of Conversation, Lot 64 D 199.</note>
                            <pb xml:id="pg_652" n="652" facs="0680"/>who had said that he was convinced that the Arabs would have to make a settlement with Israel but that each year that passed it would become harder. The Iraq Ambassador had suggested that discussions might start on the basis of the 1947 <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Resolutions. The Secretary said that he had pointed out that they gave part of the Galilee to the Arabs but gave the Negev to Israel. The Iraq Ambassador said there could be an exchange of part of the Negev to Jordan or Egypt for a retention of Galilee territory by Israel. The Secretary said the Israelis would probably not start negotiations on the assumption they would have to make large concessions but they are in a bad way. It is becoming apparent that there is the same psychology there that there is in Korea and Formosa, a belief that their only hope lies in a global war since they cannot themselves alone defeat the Arabs conclusively. The influence of world Jewry to support developments in that direction would be considerable. We should not minimize the pressures that would come from: (1) pro-Israel elements and (2) the group that favors generally an early showdown with the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said there was a similar situation in Great Britain except that there the extremists included those who opposed the policy of turning over the Suez Base to Egypt. The only way to meet that pressure is to develop a line of support for our friends, that is the Iraqis and the rest of the Northern Tier. We can exercise little weight in Egypt today but we can in Iraq. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> asked whether it would not be possible to make a reaffirmation of the 1950 Declaration which would in fact be a guarantee of peace and might deter any contemplated preventive action. Such a reaffirmation would not be what the Israel Government is asking for but it might be something just short of it.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the 1950 commitment already goes somewhat beyond what is authorized under our Constitution. He believed however that we can say that it is our present policy to seek to deter a country that sends troops beyond its borders, to seek peace and to support <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action. We can say that that is our present policy but the Secretary believed that the Executive Branch of the Government in the United States could not make a commitment that we would take armed action in the future. He said he was extremely dubious of any willingness on the part of the Senate to give a security guarantee. In a discussion that he had with Senator <persName corresp="#p_GWF1">George</persName>, just before leaving Washington, the Senator had expressed his doubt <pb xml:id="pg_653" n="653" facs="0681"/>that the Senate would take such action.<note n="4" xml:id="d358fn4">According to a memorandum of conversation by <persName>Dulles</persName> of a conversation with Senator <persName corresp="#p_GWF1">George</persName> on October 21, <persName>Dulles</persName> asked the Senator whether he thought the Senate would approve a security treaty with Israel that would guarantee the present armistice lines once the Arab States and Israel had negotiated an agreed settlement; Senator <persName corresp="#p_GWF1">George</persName> expressed doubt that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee or the full Senate would approve a security treaty under these circumstances. (Memorandum of Conversation, by <persName>Dulles</persName>, October 21; Eisenhower Library, Dulles Papers, “Sen <persName corresp="#p_GWF1">Walter George</persName>”)</note> It must be remembered that it required a two-thirds’ vote. There might be a better chance of getting a joint resolution which only requires a majority in both houses. As next year’s elections draw nearer, the pressure for a joint resolution would grow.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> asked about the feasibility of a policy of: (1) reaffirming the 1950 Declaration, possibly followed later by a joint resolution in the United States and (2) the United States acceding to the Baghdad Pact. These would balance off as between Israel and the Arab states. The Secretary said that if we should be forced into giving a new guarantee to Israel it probably could be balanced by the United States joining the Baghdad Pact. The latter would also however require Congressional action. There could be no treaty unless the Executive took the initiative, although there can be a joint resolution on Congressional initiative. Both an Israel security measure and a Baghdad Pact could be done by joint resolution. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> noted that if the United States should give a security guarantee to Israel and not adhere to the Baghdad Pact, it would have the effect of splitting the United States and the United Kingdom in the area, which would be a tremendous gain for the Soviets. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>, in trying to split the United States and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, was helping the Soviets to achieve that end.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he might summarize the position which he intended to take with <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>: (1) we are strongly opposed to any move toward a preventive war; (2) emphasize that our policy, in accordance with the 1950 Declaration, is to oppose both aggression and an arms race; (3) urge that Israel make a settlement with the Arab states as the only permanent solution and that it consider seriously what concessions it can make toward that end. With respect to general policy in the area the Secretary said he believed the Northern Tier as a basic concept is and was sound. There may be some differences between the United States and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> because of conflicting views of the military people of the two countries in the area. The Secretary said that neither he nor the President are concerned over the question of U.S. versus British equipment in the area although our military people object to using U.S. funds for offshore procurement of British equipment for other countries since, <pb xml:id="pg_654" n="654" facs="0682"/>if the funds are used to send obsolescent U.S. equipment abroad, the proceeds can be used to purchase new equipment for the U.S. military. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said that the whole line of supply in the Middle East now is British equipment. It is very small in any event but he believed that it was impractical to mix it up. He felt that there might be, however, an agreement to divide up the types of equipment which each of the two countries might provide. It was a matter of considerable importance to Britain that the tanks for the area be British, but on other things there could be a division with respect to the line of supply. The Secretary said that the United States would have political and military observers at the November 20 meeting in Baghdad and suggested that this might be one of the things to be discussed there. He said that he had told the Iraq Ambassador last week that we would look sympathetically on Iraq’s effort to build up strength. The Secretary referred to previous discussions between Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> and the President about U.S. offshore procurement of Centurion tanks. He said that we had only had funds to purchase ten Centurions at the present time but that, in accordance with his previous undertaking to <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>, we intended to ask Congress for funds to buy more Centurions under offshore procurement in the coming year. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> inquired whether it would be possible for the U.S. to tell Nuri that. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> replied that he doubted if we could be specific on that score but he would see what we could do.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he was seriously concerned about the situation in Syria. It was the nearest of all the Arab states to becoming a Soviet puppet. The other Arab states feel that they can keep their independence. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDC1">Malik</persName> of Lebanon has been pressing us for a year to take action to prevent Syria from becoming a Soviet puppet. It is doubtful that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> could or would do anything to stop this trend. As a result of the Egyptian-Syrian Pact<note n="5" xml:id="d358fn5">On October 20, Egypt and Syria signed a mutual defense pact which provided for a unified military command.</note> there will be a flow of Soviet arms into Syria with the result that Israel will be newly threatened both from the north and the south. It is not clear just how Iraq intends to act with respect to Syria, whether by coup or attack. It would be hard for us to be benevolent about the latter. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said that Syria had been acting most badly in the way it was hiking its charges on the pipeline and threatening to hold up the passage of oil. Such a stoppage would be most serious for Britain and Western Europe generally; it would be a major blow to Iraq since it would cut Iraq’s income in half. Up to now he had been discouraging Nuri with respect to taking action in Syria largely because it would put Iraq on the Israel border. But if <pb xml:id="pg_655" n="655" facs="0683"/>Syria is going to become a Soviet puppet, Israel might prefer to have Iraq as its neighbor.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the same pattern had been observed in Egypt … and Syria with respect to requests to purchase U.S. arms from the United States. They secretly negotiated a deal with the Soviets, then came to us asking about possible arms purchases, told us conditions were unacceptable (although they had not objected to them before and they provided only for no resale, no use for aggressive purposes and not giving away secrets relating to them) and then proceeded to announce a deal with the Soviets. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> observed that the Arabs are paying the Soviets for the arms with our money: oil revenues, unblocked sterling or economic assistance. The Secretary said that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> is toying with forces far greater than he knows anything about. In the face of Communist methods of penetration he is a babe in the woods. The Secretary does not doubt his sincerity but does doubt his capacity to control the situation he is getting into. In purpose at least <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> does not intend to allow Egypt to be taken over by the Communists. He would like to emulate Yugoslavia and get the best of both worlds. The difference, however, is that Yugoslavia knows the score, and is unlikely to fall again into the jaws of Moscow. Tito is a past master at dealing with the Kremlin. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> is completely unversed. The question is can we capitalize on his intention not to let the Communists take over. This leads to the question of the Aswan Dam. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said that he thought it was important to differentiate between <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> and his arms deal and the people of Egypt and their genuine long-term interests. Arms are ephemeral. The dam will last for generations and be an outstanding symbol of benefit to the people. If we build it, it will help our position. Otherwise, the Kremlin will capitalize on it. The Secretary said that it would not be possible to commence construction on the dam until there was agreement between the Sudan and Egypt on a division of water and with respect to the land which would be covered by the reservoir. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said that he expected the Sudan Parliament to pass a resolution asking Britain and Egypt as the codomini to grant Sudanese independence. Britain will say that it approves. If there is a delay in independence it is certain that Egypt will spend money in an effort to interfere in any Sudanese election. Moreover, Sudan will not agree on the water until there is independence. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> asked whether it would not be wise to make a package for <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> on the Sudan: (1) Sudanese independence and (2) agreement on the Nile waters.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_656" n="656" facs="0684"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> read two telegrams which had just been received from Acting Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> in connection with the Aswan Dam.<note n="6" xml:id="d358fn6">
                                <ref target="#d354">Documents 354</ref> and <ref target="#d355">355</ref>.</note> The Secretary said that he believes Egypt really would prefer to have the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> in on the building of the dam, and not to have it done by the Soviets, if it appears that it could be done expeditiously. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said that the reason for the entry of the British-German-French consortium was to keep the Soviets out. If the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> can handle the allotting of the construction contracts on a semi-political basis so that the Soviets would not be in on the construction and getting <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and Western funds, he would have no objection to going ahead through the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>. The Secretary said that he thought it ought to be possible to exclude the Soviets from <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> contracts. The <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> could build the dam with less cost to Egypt since the financial risk on the part of contractors would be much less. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said that he would immediately inform the Foreign Office that he wished to have discussions on the dam go forward in Washington as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> had suggested.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said that he had been having trouble over the Sultan of Muscat… . He said that the British Prime Minister was making an announcement in Parliament that day which he hoped would help keep the Arabs from making outrageous claims. The Secretary said that unfortunately it looked as though U.S. and British aims are likely to conflict in Saudi Arabia. Our airbase concession is coming up for renegotiation next year and we have large oil interests there. The King of Saudi Arabia had told us that he expects us to support him in his efforts against the British in the south.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said that with respect to arms for the Middle East the British plan to go ahead using <gloss target="#t_NEACC1">NEACC</gloss>. They do not intend to supply Centurions to Israel but would supply small stuff. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> raised the question as to the utility of the <gloss target="#t_NEACC1">NEACC</gloss> in view of the entry of the Soviets into the Middle East arms picture. The Secretary and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> agreed that <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> should hold discussions in London the following week on the future of <gloss target="#t_NEACC1">NEACC</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> suggested that the <gloss target="#t_NEACC1">NEACC</gloss> might be used for the exchange of information but not be expected to exercise controls.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 38. At meeting with Secretary in Paris this afternoon<note n="2" xml:id="d359fn2">The memorandum of this conversation is not printed. (Department of State, Conference Files: Lot 60 D 627, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 566)</note> Israel Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> said he believed both Soviet Union and Egypt should, as result of arms deal, be confronted by Western powers with necessity of making sharp choice. Soviet Union should not be permitted to have détente in one part of world while using it to create dangers in another. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> said Egypt similarly should be required to reject arms deal or forego any form of Western help or association. He said prior to deal Egypt had marked superiority over Israel in all heavy weapons in air, sea, and land; e.g. 160 tanks to 104; 83 jet planes to 28; 10 bombers to 2; 3 destroyers to 0. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> asserted present talk of preventive war came not from Israel but from world opinion. He said however he dreaded day when it may be a necessary resort for Israel safety. What is required to make preventive war unnecessary and prospect of Egyptian attempt annihilate Israel unthinkable? It may be I.G. cannot fully redress an arms imbalance resulting from arms deal but certain things absolutely necessary: jet planes comparable to Migs, tanks and naval aircraft. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> not asking for blanket commitment but for assurance that if I.G. submits list it will be considered sympathetically and on most favorable possible basis as to prices and credit terms. Secondly, he asked that U.S. give Israel security treaty without conditions mentioned by Secretary in August 26 statement as it impossible to conceive of time when such a treaty so critically necessary as now. Both arms and treaty would serve as powerful deterrent to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>. If these not quickly forthcoming there would be disillusionment in Israel and sentiment for preventive action. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> said he had just seen <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> who was vague and negative in his response.</p>
                        <p>Secretary replied that U.S. shares <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>’s view of gravity of recent developments in area. They constitute threat to Israel and broader threat to West Europe and all free world. Our information indicates Soviet arms going not only to Egypt but to … Syria… . Oil from Arab world virtually indispensable to economic life of <pb xml:id="pg_658" n="658" facs="0686"/>Europe and Britain’s economy especially would be threatened by loss of oil revenues. Moreover Egypt is gateway to Africa. This is most serious situation to arise since World War II, more far-reaching in consequence than Korea. We intend to deal with it as such.</p>
                        <p>With respect <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> suggestion of confronting Soviet Union with sharp choice, Secretary said we recognize that world relaxation must be one and indivisible. Soviet Union cannot have good fellowship in one area while creating new front of attack in another. Secretary said he could assure <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> our relations with Soviet Union will take that into account but timing and method of raising it must be carefully considered and he doubted wisdom of giving full publicity to it now. Concerning Egypt, Secretary doubted if complete withdrawal of West would help. If confronted with demand to make choice, <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> would probably have no alternative but to go on with arms deal. Weter [<hi rend="italic">Western</hi>?] economic aid not so important to Egypt as to overbalance in <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s mind sentiment in <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> which would result in his overthrow if arms deal now cancelled. We have considered both approaches carefully. We may as time goes on be forced to revise our position but our present thinking is that to confront <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> with the requirement of choice between giving up arms deal and continuing association with West would not produce result we both want.</p>
                        <p>With respect comparative military equipment of Israel and Egypt, our intelligence figures indicate Israel has superiority in most categories. Perhaps we and I.G. should attempt to reconcile this conflict in our information. In any event we are not convinced that the arms deal will in itself produce decisive imbalance. Do not yet know condition of equipment or Egyptian ability to use it. We should not minimize effect of deal on Egyptian strength but neither should we exaggerate it.</p>
                        <p>With respect <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> request concerning furnishing of arms to Israel, we do not believe it would be profitable to anyone to promote arms race in area. It is not possible for Israel, in view of wide disparity in populations, to have military superiority or even equality with Arab strength given willingness of Soviet Union to provide large scale arms. Even if Israel had 100 per cent of its arms absorptive capacity it could not in such a case maintain balance and it would be unwise to embark on that task. This does not mean that we rule out arms for Israel on a modest and normal basis. We will sympathetically consider any list that Israel submits but not on basis of embarking in race with Soviet Union to push arms into the area.</p>
                        <p>With respect security treaty, we have made clear by 1950 declaration we would seek to prevent active aggression by either side, that for us Israel is a permanent fact, and there cannot be action against Israel without strong reaction from U.S. Secretary said <pb xml:id="pg_659" n="659" facs="0687"/>he is doubtful about wisdom of trying to convert statements of present policy into a treaty. It would need a two-thirds vote of Senate. Senate not now in session and could not act to deal with present situation. Had lunch with Senator <persName corresp="#p_GWF1">George</persName> before coming here<note n="3" xml:id="d359fn3">See <ref target="#d358fn4">footnote 4</ref>, <hi rend="italic">supra.</hi>
                            </note> and he was extremely doubtful whether Senate would ratify such treaty if presented by administration. Moreover, not at all certain President would feel like recommending treaty in absence of settlement.</p>
                        <p>Secretary said <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> should not draw conclusion however that only way out of present problem is preventive war. If there were preventive war by Israel we would, however embarrassed by the necessity, feel impelled to act under 1950 declaration. This not a threat or warning but merely a reminder that declaration works both ways. Israel could not except to have advantage of declaration without being itself denied right of aggression. Secretary said he could not see any salvation for Israel in preventive action. Suppose it won some battles. Area would be left with greater unsettlement than before and with Arabs more hostile than ever. In such case Israel would in the long run be submerged by attrition if not by war. Secretary said only way to deal with situation is for Israel to work out a settlement with the Arabs. Israel could probably have reached a better settlement last year than this and can make a better settlement this year than it probably can next. Israel ought seriously consider the extent of sacrifice it willing to make to obtain settlement.</p>
                        <p>Secretary concluded by saying Israel has tremendous asset in good will of all American people. What a people will do in assisting another country depends more on such things than on treaties. For this reason Secretary has negotiated security treaties on year to year basis. It is a matter of the greatest importance from the standpoint of Israel that it keep the good will of the American people and their support of our present policies that will afford protection to Israel. Israel can be sure we are continuing to work on policies promoting Israel security.</p>
                        <p>Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> agreed to discuss matter further in Geneva after <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> talks with <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>.<note n="4" xml:id="d359fn4">The Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> met again in Geneva at 5 p.m., October 30.

                                <ref target="#d354">Documents 354</ref> and <ref target="#d355">355</ref>.</note> When Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> and I met <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> re Aswan dam today we pointed out that US Government fully shared apprehensions of <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> re Soviet activities in Middle East but we had serious reservations re any approach to Aswan project except through <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>, for reasons stated in reftels. <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> said London was afraid delay might result in Russia’s undertaking tremendous project halfway down in Africa and that chief advantage of consortium was that it was ready to sign. I pointed out that if US, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> worked together energetically, we might give <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> a sufficiently encouraging letter of intent to prevent his signing with <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> emphasized that we could not rush into project of this magnitude. He said <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> would lend $200 million on project but only on condition that US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would put up additional $200 million in grant aid. Moreover, he thought US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> should be prepared to underwrite entire project if necessary, once we started. Egyptian contribution in local currency, approximately $900 million, amounting to perhaps $75 million per year, might be stopped at any time and we would then be faced with alternative of putting in additional money or of withdrawing and allowing Russians to pick up where we left off. Total liability of US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> might reach one billion dollars, and we should be prepared for project to cost us at least $300 million each. Since US now holds about one billion dollars worth of surplus cotton, Congress would be highly skeptical of proposal to put that much money into Egypt, much of which would result in additional cotton production there. We would be flying directly into face of our whole agricultural program in US. I added that US public would have difficulty understanding large additional US commitment to Egypt at present, particularly if we rushed into project in which no US firms were participating. In view of all these considerations, we saw no possibility of producing money for consortium deal and were convinced that only possibility of progress was through <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_661" n="661" facs="0689"/>
                        <p>While <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> naturally made no commitment it was my impression he fully realized practical impossibility of implementing <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> proposal. On other hand he appeared to share our feeling that if preliminary agreement could be reached between US, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>, a satisfactory approach could be made to Egyptians in reasonably near future.</p>
                        <p>In view of circumstances outlined <gloss target="#t_Tosec1">Tosec</gloss> 29, <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> appeared to agree that best location for further discussions was in Washington, especially because Egyptian Finance Minister expected arrive here in about two weeks. <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> stated he would recommend London that three-way conversations be held between <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, US and <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> soonest possible.<note n="4" xml:id="d360fn4">

                        <p>[Here follows a report by <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen W. Dulles</persName> that King <persName corresp="#p_SAA1">Saud</persName> of Saudi Arabia, as a result of a recent incident at the Buraimi Oasis, had ordered a break in diplomatic relations with Great Britain.]</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> said he thought that the Council would be interested in hearing his most recent reports from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> proceeded to read a report of a discussion between Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> on the situation in the Middle East.<note n="2" xml:id="d361fn2">See <ref target="#d358">Document 358</ref>.</note> This had become so extremely serious that the possibility existed that Iraq might be permitted to take action against Syria where Communist influence had reached such a serious point.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ conversation with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>,<note n="3" xml:id="d361fn3">See <ref target="#d359">Document 359</ref>.</note> the latter had demanded that Egypt be forced to withdraw from its arms deal with Czechoslovakia. Furthermore, <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> had asked for a security treaty for Israel without the conditions to such a treaty which had been set forth in the speech of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> on August 26. In reply Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had indicated that the United States could not sponsor an arms race in the Middle East and that the United States Senate would not ratify a security treaty in the absence of the conditions set forth in his August 26 speech. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had added that the United States did not object to a modest increase in Israel armaments. Finally, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had said that if a preventive war were launched, the United States would stand by its commitments in the Tripartite Declaration of 1950.</p>
                        <p>With respect to a conversation with Senator <persName corresp="#p_GWF1">George</persName>, Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee,<note n="4" xml:id="d361fn4">See <ref target="#d358fn4">footnote 4, Document 358</ref>.</note> Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had told Senator <persName corresp="#p_GWF1">George</persName> that in his opinion the problem of Israeli-Arab relations had been handled by the prior administration wholly in terms of domestic political considerations and without reference to the true national interest of the United States. He added that he <pb xml:id="pg_663" n="663" facs="0691"/>himself intended to handle the problem in the light of the national interest. Senator <persName corresp="#p_GWF1">George</persName> had seemed to comprehend and sympathize with this point of view.</p>
                        <p>By way of further comment Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> pointed out that border incidents between the Israelis and the Egyptians continued. The latter were apparently responsible for the latest incident and a much heavier Israeli retaliatory attack must now be awaited. The situation was extremely serious.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows an additional report by <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> to the effect that <persName>Dulles</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> had agreed to conclude the Geneva Foreign Ministers’ meeting by November 19 as well as an observation by <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen W.

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName> explained the revisions in Paragraphs 10 through 13 in the Supplementary Statement of Policy in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5428 which had been agreed to by the Planning Board in the light of the discussion of the paper by the National Security Council last week<note n="10" xml:id="d361fn10">See <ref target="#d345">Document 345</ref>.</note> and in the light of the views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He pointed out that the three sub-paragraphs of Paragraph 10A, dealing with financial and economic sanctions against an aggressor or a potential <pb xml:id="pg_664" n="664" facs="0692"/>aggressor, had been agreed to at last week’s Council meeting. With respect to the establishment of a blockade or further military action against Israel or an Arab State, he pointed out that there was still a split in the present revised draft. The Joint Chiefs of Staff, in sub-Paragraph d of Paragraph 10A, were still calling for the United States to be prepared to establish a blockade with Congressional authority if it appeared that the financial and economic sanctions mentioned above seemed unlikely to end the hostilities promptly. The State Department, however, had offered its own paragraph on the subject of a blockade or further military intervention. This paragraph indicated that because the financial and economic sanctions might prove insufficient to end the hostilities promptly, a study should be made of the desirability and feasibility of taking military action including a blockade.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName>’s briefing, the Vice President inquired whether an embargo could be established against an aggressor in the Middle East by the Executive Branch of the Government on its own initiative and without Congressional authorization. Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> replied that he understood this to be the case and that the authority of the Executive Branch derived from two acts of Congress: The Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 and the Export Control Act of 1949. The Attorney General commented that whether or not the Executive Branch could legally resort to a blockade without further specific Congressional authorization, a serious policy question remained as to whether we would want to do so.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on the new revised paper, Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> suggested that either Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> or Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> might wish to comment further on these views.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> stated that the Joint Chiefs of Staff preferred their own paragraph with respect to the possibility of resorting to a blockade. Personally, however, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said that he did not believe there was much to choose between the Joint Chiefs’ language and the paragraph proposed by the Department of State. He pointed out that it was unrealistic and impossible for the Joint Chiefs of Staff to formulate plans which contemplated U.S. military intervention beyond the phase of a blockade. Such further military intervention could not be planned for until developments between Israel and one or more of the Arab States had reached a point where we could determine which of the Arab States was going to attack Israel. Accordingly, concluded Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>, if the limitations on the capability of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to make plans to meet all the possible contingencies in a war between Israel and the Arab States were clearly kept in mind, he would be willing to accept either the Joint Chiefs of Staff or the State versions of the disputed paragraphs. <pb xml:id="pg_665" n="665" facs="0693"/>In any event, the present new draft was a great improvement on its predecessor.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President said that he judged from Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>’s statement that with certain qualifications the Joint Chiefs would be willing to accept the State version. He then asked if there were any further comments on this point.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> explained the reasons why the State Department felt quite deeply that their own wording in Paragraph 10B was preferable to the wording proposed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Joint Chiefs of Staff wording seemed to the State Department to make a blockade more or less mandatory. State, on the other hand, felt that, looking at the matter practically, any U.S. move to impose a blockade on an aggressor would first have to come before the National Security Council for a decision whatever the circumstances then prevailing. Accordingly, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> felt that the State Department’s language, calling merely for a study of the feasibility and desirability of a blockade, was preferable to the Joint Chiefs of Staff version.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said, that as he understood the problem from Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>’s remarks, any studies of this problem undertaken by the Joint Chiefs of Staff would be strictly confined to advance planning but would not comprise any military or naval movements or any allocation of forces or additional expenditures until such time as the actual outbreak of war occurred. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> replied that in the matter of a blockade, the Joint Chiefs of Staff would be in a position to formulate very detailed plans which could be implemented very promptly. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said he very much preferred the plan proposed by State to that proposed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> added that he shared Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName>’s opinion, that none of the major decisions set forth in National Security Council policy papers were ever actually made in advance of the occasion. You decided on what course of action to take at the time you were faced with the necessity for decision. That was why he had so strenuously objected to the courses of action with respect to hostilities between Israel and the Arab States set forth in the original Supplementary Statement of Policy in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5428.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> and Director Hughes said that they were willing to go along with the language proposed by the State Department although Mr. Hughes said that his agreement depended upon a clearer understanding that the military study called for in the State Department paragraph would not involve the actual allocation of naval vessels or additional military forces. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> reassured Mr. Hughes that in response to the language in Paragraph 10B, the Joint Chiefs would simply proceed to make a general <pb xml:id="pg_666" n="666" facs="0694"/>appraisal of the situation in its studies and plans. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, however, felt that the qualifications on military planning which he and Mr. Hughes had been speaking of should be made clearer so that no military plans would proceed to the point of actual programming as opposed to planning in the strictest sense.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> pointed out that the courses of action set forth in the present paper would gradually become known down the line in the staffs of the various responsible departments and agencies and accordingly were likely, ultimately, to leak out. He therefore wanted to make the courses of action as tough as they could feasibly be. He believed that if there were mental reservations among the members of the Council as to the proposed courses of action, such mental reservations should be made explicit and discussed by the Council. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> agreed with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> and said that he did not want the language presently set forth in the State Department’s proposed Paragraph 10B to be watered down further by qualifications on the kind of studies and plans that the military would make for possible military action. He believed that such studies and plans should be promptly carried to their conclusions in order that the United States could act quickly if developments between Israel and the Arab States made such action necessary. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> said that naturally we hoped that we would never be called upon to take the courses of action outlined in the paper but, in point of fact, we might be compelled to and, accordingly, he agreed with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName>’s point of view. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RN1">Nelson Rockefeller</persName> said he also favored a tough statement to the Israelis as a deterrent to preventive war. He felt that the possible application of military force would constitute a much more effective deterrent in this instance than the financial and economic sanctions.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President recalled to the National Security Council that in their discussion of this problem last week, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> expressed the opinion that the financial and economic sanctions in sub-Paragraphs 10–a, b and c were sufficient to stop the Israelis from undertaking preventive war. As for the additional courses of action which contemplated military action against Israel, in the form of a blockade or actual intervention, these additional courses were “very frankly a bluff”.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> observed that a blockade of Israel could be very effective indeed although less so in the case of Egypt. A second step open to the United States would be to destroy certain key military installations within the territories of the aggressor state by precision bombing. Such a move, he believed, would really hamper the Egyptians and the Israelis. However, if the United States were to proceed from this step to the next step of direct military intervention with ground forces, such intervention would constitute a major <pb xml:id="pg_667" n="667" facs="0695"/>military task. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> estimated that in the event of hostilities between Israel and its Arab neighbors, as many as 500,000 troops might actually be involved. This figure indicated the magnitude of the task which would face any U.S. force which was to intervene in the struggle.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President warned the Council again, as he had at the previous meeting, that we could never get the Congress to agree to a course of action which involved the United States in hostilities against Israel.<note n="11" xml:id="d361fn11">The Vice President subsequently made clear that the term “hostilities” as used here did not apply to a U.S. blockade but to physical intervention with U.S. troops. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> On the other hand, he thought the present draft was essentially what the Council had asked for and desired provided the Council kept clearly in mind that in certain instances we were talking about courses of action which we are very unlikely ever to take although we might threaten to take such courses of action as a deterrent.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> stated that if the Council had now agreed to accept the State Department Paragraph 10B on the study of desirability and feasibility of taking military action, he would like to suggest certain changes in Paragraph 11B. There ensued a considerable discussion of language appropriate to revising Paragraph 11B, the upshot of which was Council agreement to accept a revision of Paragraph 11B suggested by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName>.</p>

                        <p>Agreed to recommend to the President the revision of the Supplementary Statement of Policy contained in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5428 by substituting the following for paragraphs 10 through 13 thereof:</p>
                        <p> “10. a. In the event of major armed conflict between Israel and the Arab States, the U.S. should be prepared to take the following action against the state or states which are determined by a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> finding or, if necessary, by the U.S. to be responsible for the conflict or which refuse to withdraw their forces behind the Palestine Armistice line of 1950:</p>
                        <p>(1) Discontinue U.S. Government aid.</p>
                        <p>(2) Embargo U.S. trade</p>
                        <p>(3) Prevent the direct or indirect transfer of funds or other assets subject to U.S. control.</p>
                        <p>b. Because the actions in paragraph 10–a above may not be sufficient to end the hostilities promptly, study the desirability and feasibility of taking military action, including a blockade.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_668" n="668" facs="0696"/>
                        <p>c. Take the following actions either before or concurrent with measures outlined in paragraph 10–a:</p>
                        <p>(1) Urge other countries, as appropriate, to take action similar to that of the United States.</p>
                        <p>(2) Make every effort to secure United Nations sanction and support for all such actions.</p>
                        <p> “11. a. In collaboration with the United Kingdom, and to the extent desirable and feasible with France and Turkey, develop plans to support the measures in paragraph 10–a above.</p>
                        <p>b. Make the studies regarding military action referred to in paragraph 10–b above unilaterally. At such time later as it may be indicated that combined military action will be taken, be prepared to collaborate in such planning with the United Kingdom and to the extent desirable with other nations.</p>
                        <p> “12. At a time and in a way he deems most likely to be effective, the Secretary of State should inform Israel and the Arab States privately that the United States, in accordance with existing policy, will seek to prevent resort to armed aggression by either Israel or the Arab States and, if it should occur, will seek to stop it quickly.</p>
                        <p> “13. As appropriate, enlist Congressional support for the measures in the above paragraphs.”</p>

                        <p>The Secretary showed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> a copy of the President’s letter to <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>
                            <note n="2" xml:id="d363fn2">
                                <ref target="#d334">Document 334</ref>.</note> and a copy of the latter’s reply.<note n="3" xml:id="d363fn3">
                                <ref target="#d349">Document 349</ref>.</note> He did not leave a copy of either of the letters with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said that he was seeing <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> tomorrow. It was his thought that the three Western Foreign Ministers might see <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> about the Middle East separately. Depending on developments they might wish to see him together at some later time. The Secretary read from a memorandum of points which he intended to make with <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> when he saw him, probably on Sunday.<note n="4" xml:id="d363fn4">That same afternoon, the Secretary transmitted the text of this proposed statement to the Department of State and invited suggestions. (<gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 60 from Geneva; Department of State, Central Files, 396.1–GE/10–2855) The Department responded with comments on October 29. (<gloss target="#t_Tosec1">Tosec</gloss> 77 to Geneva; <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> 396.1–GE/10–2955) On October 31, the Department was informed that “Secretary did not leave any paper with <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> [on October 30].” (<gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 101 from Geneva; <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> Conference Files: Lot 60 D 627, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 570)</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> commented that he thought the line which the Secretary intended to take was excellent. It hinged the problem on the Israel-Arab dispute and not on large Middle East problems which would give the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> an opening for attempting to assert a role in the area. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> may say that the Western Powers are increasing tension by promoting the Northern Tier. Our reply should be that we are not talking about that but about the tension between Israel and the Arab states which threatens to blow up into full scale warfare if the Soviets continue along their present course. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said he had cabled the Prime Minister that he felt the present farcical situation of our smiling pleasantly at the Soviets while they fomented <pb xml:id="pg_671" n="671" facs="0699"/>discord and tensions in the Middle East could not go on indefinitely. The question is largely one of timing and of how to make clear where the responsibility for the difficulty lies. We cannot raise the matter too sharply at the beginning of this Conference and run the risk of disappointing the Germans or being held at fault by world opinion and ending the “Geneva Spirit”.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he thought he might leave a copy of the paper he had just read from with <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> as an aide-mémoire. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said he thought that might be desirable.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary summarized the statement which he had made to <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> in Paris. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said that his statement had been very similar.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> went on to say that he thought that it might be good idea to try and push Jordan in the direction of its Hashemite cousins, Iraq. It might be that Jordan could be induced to move toward a settlement with Israel if it had the backing of Iraq.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that at the 11 o’clock trilateral meeting the following day (October 29) the question of the Middle East might be raised with the French in a cursory way. This would have the effect of not excluding them from any consideration of the problem but also of not becoming too heavily involved with them on it.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> was trying desperately to see <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> but was not sure he would succeed. He thought it would be a good thing for each of them to meet the other. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>’s obvious reluctance to see <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> appears to tie in with Soviet objectives in the Arab world, i.e., showing that the Soviets are having little or nothing to do with Israel and devoting themselves to the Arabs. In any event the Secretary had agreed to see <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> while he was in Geneva.<note n="5" xml:id="d363fn5">See <ref target="#d371">Document 371</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that our people in Washington had been annoyed about the suddenness of the British action in Buraimi and the absence of any prior information about it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> replied that the reason for not informing us was that the British had felt that we would prefer to be in a position of not appearing to have been committed to the action by any prior word of it.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the Aswan Dam, the Secretary said that if we go ahead with it, it will be portrayed as a result which the Egyptians have achieved from us by playing around with the Soviets. It will seem to justify <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s policy. Our friends will complain and will demand their more substantial evidence of reward for their friendship. It will make the area very expensive indeed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said the problem basically is whether we can win Egypt back or whether we should concentrate on other Arab countries. The Secretary <pb xml:id="pg_672" n="672" facs="0700"/>said that he felt that we should not enter upon the construction of the Dam on a blind gamble. Aside from the political hazards involved, it was essential for purely economic reasons for Egypt to be on a peace basis before the construction was undertaken. The construction will require substantial contributions by Egypt both in the form of domestic resources and foreign exchange. It will not be in a position to provide these if it is buying arms on a large scale. It has been demonstrated that, particularly for small countries, the cost of maintaining modern arms equipment is a huge burden. We should have a clear understanding from <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> with respect to a settlement with Israel and with respect to their future cooperation with the West before we undertake to cooperate in the construction of the Dam. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> suggested that we proceed to complete plans for financing the Aswan Dam and satisfy ourselves that it is feasible. We could then tell <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> we are prepared to undertake it if he meets two conditions: (1) not buying unnecessary arms; (2) settling with Israel (which would make large-scale arms unnecessary). The Secretary said that such an approach would also help with respect to the Northern Tier countries as the Dam would appear not as a reward for doing business with the Soviets but as an inducement to make peace with Israel.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> handed the Secretary a memorandum stating that he had received information that the Egyptians will probably inform the political opponents of the Libyan Prime Minister of the Egyptians’ offer to provide arms to Libya and that it was essential that the Prime Minister should very shortly be able to go to the country with a statement about U.S. willingness to give arms to Libya. Otherwise, it will be politically impossible for him to refuse the Egyptian offer. The Libyan Prime Minister has stated that he realized the difficulty of immediate shipment of arms but he suggested that staff talks, to which he could allude publicly, should start shortly.</p>

                        <p>1. Dean Rusk called at my office and we discussed project envisioned in <gloss target="#t_Tedul1">Tedul</gloss> 12<note n="2" xml:id="d366fn2">On October 25 in <gloss target="#t_Tedul1">Tedul</gloss> 12 <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> suggested to the Secretary that he, <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName>, approach Arthur Dean, “looking toward possibility that he undertake mission to Arab States and Israel which would include talks with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> on subjects discussed your statement of August 26 and question of High Aswan Dam.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 684A.86/10–2555)</note> and <gloss target="#t_Dulte1">Dulte</gloss> 11.<note n="3" xml:id="d366fn3">
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> replied in <gloss target="#t_Dulte1">Dulte</gloss> 11 from Paris, October 26, that while he believed Dean was “best qualified for this particular mission”, he really preferred Dean Rusk for the task, as Rusk was “persona grata with both Israelis and Arabs. Fact that he served under Democratic Administration is further asset in this situation which calls for bipartisanship.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> Conference Files: Lot 60 D 627, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 621)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. While Rusk was most interested and obviously desired to be helpful he pointed out the following problems:</p>
                        <p>a. Important meeting of <persName corresp="#p_RN1">Rockefeller</persName> Foundation covering all aspects of foreign operations planned for early December. He unable devote much if any time to project until conclusion of meeting. I advised him that while we had no firm time schedule now in mind, it probable that action would be desirable before that date.</p>
                        <p>b. He stated that while Israelis would probably have confidence in him, Arabs might not. The reason was that in past negotiations each time he made firm proposal to Arabs former Administration pulled rug out from under him.</p>
                        <p>c. He has already been informally approached by both Arabs and Israelis for informal conversations in New York. I suggested he proceed, keeping us advised of developments, which he promised to do.</p>
                        <p>3. In discussing above developments with <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> this morning, he suggested George Brownell as substitute in event Rusk unable to accept responsibility. While I do not know Brownell personally, all reports would indicate he might be quite satisfactory. I will take no action pending advice from you.<note n="4" xml:id="d366fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> cabled <persName>Dulles</persName> on November 1 that he and <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> doubted Rusk would accept the assignment.

                        <p>“I have the honor to draw to your attention the very serious situation prevailing in the Elauja demilitarized zone and vicinity.</p>
                        <p>“It appears that both parties have recently been sending additional armed personnel into the area and occupying new defensive positions.</p>
                        <p>“The grave incident in which Egyptians attacked an Israeli police post in the demilitarized zone inflicting casualties and taking prisoners was followed by violent Israeli retaliation at Kuntilla of more serious extent.</p>
                        <p>“The Security Council has repeatedly condemned aggressive activities and retaliations which can only cause the situation between the parties to deteriorate.</p>
                        <p>“In view of my responsibilities, I formally request both parties to issue orders to their forces in the vicinity of the Elauja demilitarized zone, and at all other points where they are close together to cease all aggressive activities and retaliations, and restrict their operations to defense, in keeping with the terms of the General Armistice Agreement.</p>
                        <p>“I call to attention of both parties the grave moral responsibility that will be borne by the party which takes offensive action of any kind which, in this situation, may result in the gravest consequences.</p>
                        <p>“I am authorized by the Secretary General to state that he has seen this letter and that this demarche is made also on his behalf.”</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> asked <persName>Burns</persName> if more <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> personnel for patrol of borders were needed and indicated our willingness supply our share. <persName>Burns</persName> answered “How many divisions are available?” In other words <persName>Burns</persName> said few hundred additional personnel unnecessary unless <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> prepared to furnish forces roughly equivalent to those now deployed on either side of frontiers.</p>
                        <p>3. With regard to letter quoted paragraph 1 above, <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> wishes following note transmitted to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> at Geneva:</p>

In this situation he feels that you and your colleagues from the Western powers may wish to consider the possibility of using the presence of Mr. Sharrett in Geneva for direct support of their request to the two parties. He feels that such further demonstration of your concern might considerably reduce the risk of an immediate further deterioration. Mr. McMillan and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> are being informed by the British and French delegations about this suggestion to you.”<note n="3" xml:id="d367fn3">

                            <gloss target="#t_Tedul1">Tedul</gloss> 36. Eyes Only Secretary from Acting Secretary. I had two hour meeting this morning with <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> covering present Middle East problem.</p>
                        <p>1. Following your instructions we have advised Embassy Baghdad inquire from Nuri his thinking re Syrian project without implying any concurrence on our part looking toward action by him.</p>
                        <p>2. Re <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> it is our feeling that we should have one more good go-around with him in an endeavor to reach an understanding. If we fail then we can reassess our position and determine what to do next with considerably more flexibility than we feel free to do at present. If on the other hand he gives convincing evidence that he wishes to cooperate then we have much to gain by arriving at an understanding.</p>
                        <p>3. We believe there are a number of things which the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> could do for him and that in turn there are things which he <pb xml:id="pg_678" n="678" facs="0706"/>could do for us. It is improbable that all of them could be arrived at in a single bite but it might be possible to start. The approach would be on a pari passu basis without attempting to list those items in order of their importance or the manner in which they would be balanced off against each other. The following are some of the things which US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> might be able to do for him.</p>
                        <p>a. Continuance of existing economic aid program including those items now held in abeyance (such as <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>–480 80,000 tons of wheat recently requested by Egypt and substantial locomotive deal included in this year’s program).</p>
                        <p>b. Active approach by <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> on Aswan Dam of which Sudanese agreement to water rights is essential element.</p>
                        <p>c. Possibility of deferment of action looking toward a security pact for Israel.</p>
                        <p>d. Refrain from dumping US cotton on world markets in competition with Egyptian products.</p>
                        <p>e. Unfreezing of sterling balances in London.</p>
                        <p>4. On other hand, some of the things that US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would wish from Egypt could likewise be listed as follows:</p>
                        <p>a. Take more constructive attitude towards peace in the area, including both short and long term aspects.</p>
                        <p>b. Acceptance of Jordan Valley project.</p>
                        <p>c. Refrain from existing press and radio attacks on US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>d. Limit activities of Soviet missions in Arab states.</p>
                        <p>e. Use influence with Syria to minimize communist penetration.</p>
                        <p>f. Use influence with Saudis to take more friendly attitude towards US.</p>
                        <p>g. Stop acting as intermediary on arms sales to other Arab states.</p>
                        <p>5. We feel that the above approach is desirable in the near future in particular endeavor to prevent a deterioration of existing relations with the West and forestall sporadic military operations which may lead to more serious conflict with Israel.</p>
                        <p>6. Method of approach to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> could either be (a) through US and/or Embassies, or (b) through special emissary, such as Dean Rusk or other suitable individual. Latter could follow through, if successful, in larger context of endeavoring to bring some understanding between Arab states and Israel.</p>
                        <p>7. In carrying forward such an approach it should be borne constantly in mind that in such things as economic aid for Egypt we must obviously receive something concrete in return in order to forestall general deterioration of our relations in the area as outlined by <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName> in his conversation with you.<note n="2" xml:id="d368fn2">According to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ Appointment Book, <persName>Dulles</persName> met with Turkish Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName> in Paris at 3:30 p.m., October 26. (Princeton University Library, Dulles Papers) The U.S. Representative at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization sent the Department of State a summary of this conversation in <gloss target="#t_Polto1">Polto</gloss> 649 from Paris, October 26. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 780.5/10–2655)</note> In particular we think that <pb xml:id="pg_679" n="679" facs="0707"/>Aswan Dam project should be to all appearances purely an <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> project, although there is risk that other countries will be suspicious that US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> have underwritten the deal.</p>
                        <p>8. We will continue investigating these possibilities in more detail pending your comments as well as any other alternative courses of action. Among latter might be direct appeal to <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nehru</persName>, who has undoubtedly been counseling <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> closely, although at present we do not see any clear advantage to be gained.</p>

                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> has won prestige and a position of leadership in the Arab world by the Soviet arms deal. He is determined to do everything possible to maintain this position.</p>
                        <p>2. He is today no more anxious to come under Soviet domination than to join a Western alliance and is still convinced he can hold to a middle path.</p>
                        <p>3. If he can maintain his independence and prestige through an arrangement with the West, he would prefer that to a close tie-up with Soviet.</p>
                        <p>4. If he feels that the West has definitely turned its back on him, he will accept further Soviet aid, if proffered, and endeavor, <pb xml:id="pg_680" n="680" facs="0708"/>probably with a good chance of success, to bring Syria and Saudi Arabia along with him.</p>
                        <p>5. Western negotiations with. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> would be long, difficult and uncertain. If, however, the chosen alternative to this is an effort to isolate Egypt and destroy <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>, this presents grave danger, as it would probably tempt Israel to attack Egypt.</p>
                        <p>6. If we favor <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> with economic and other aid, we will of course, be importuned to bring comparable additional aid to our friends in the Northern Tier and to refuse to do so would place us in an invidious position towards our friends.</p>
                        <p>7. If <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> should for any reason be eliminated by death, it is likely that the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> would continue temporarily in control probably under Chief of Staff, <persName corresp="#p_AGAH1">Amer</persName>, who would probably be more under control of army than <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>.</p>
                        <p>9. Jordan’s adherence to Northern Tier at this particular juncture would reduce possibilities of negotiations with Egypt.</p>
                        <p>10. There is no good solution immediately available to us, but if the Egyptian-Israeli situation can be kept from erupting into open conflict, we may have some time in which to explore alternatives, both with Egypt on the one hand, and with Turkey, Iraq, etc., on the other.</p>
                        <p>11. Foregoing assumes that neither <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> nor <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> are prepared to enforce a policy within the area with their own armed forces.</p>

Secretary said President unable understand <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> view no grounds existed for concern and asked him to explain our concern and if possible ascertain why <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> felt no concern warranted. Secretary said two facts were indisputable as result arms sale: (1) risk of war between Israel and Arab neighbors had increased greatly; (2) anti-Soviet public opinion had risen in US. He hoped <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> could explain why these two developments gave Soviets no grounds for concern.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> replied that <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> letter to <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> set forth in detail Soviet view this subject. As to estimate of situation <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> said had read recent statement by General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> (which <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> later produced in October 27 <hi rend="italic">Herald Tribune</hi>)<note n="4" xml:id="d370fn4">For text of this article, entitled “Mid-East ‘Shooting War’ Not Expected by Gen. <persName>Burns</persName>,” see <hi rend="italic">New York Herald Tribune</hi>, October 27, 1955, Section 1, p. 2.</note> to effect no danger hostilities in area. Secretary assured <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> this statement did not coincide with <persName>Burns</persName>’ private views. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> said <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, in conformity with general policy for peace, was pursuing similar aims in Near East and had not felt it necessary prevent arms sale to Egypt. However, he appreciated Secretary calling attention to rise in anti-Soviet feeling in US which was matter deserving attention. Soviet Government had done nothing to justify any hostility. Up to present sale of arms to Near East area by US, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, France had been considered entirely proper. Any piling up of arms had come about not from Czech sale but from above sources. Therefore small quantity arms Czech selling Egypt on normal commercial basis could not increase danger in area. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> then inquired what specifically was expected from Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>Secretary said he did not know whether <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> intended to see <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> here but that if he did he would have opportunity judge for himself extent of danger. There was widespread feeling in US that Israel was placed in jeopardy. This was also official view Israel Government.</p>
                        <p>Secretary said he had no desire to argue rights of Soviets or Czechs to sell arms or right of Egypt to purchase them. Question was how to prevent two developments he had mentioned earlier from going further. US had tried to exercise restraining influence, as proper, on Israel to prevent what was termed a preventive war. Israel understandably found it difficult stand by doing nothing while hostile forces built up armaments to point where it might be destroyed. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> again asked what was expected of Soviet Government. <pb xml:id="pg_682" n="682" facs="0710"/>Secretary said it would be presumptuous for him to advise Soviets; he had merely pointed out two results of recent events. As to how counteract these consequences, he could only say that there had been considerable mystery and speculation as to what going on and whether program of arms deliveries would be extended to other Arab countries. If transaction were isolated and limited and if Soviet Government would so state, it might be easier deal with. If this was merely start of vast arms transaction, that was another matter. Secretary said he was not making suggestion since US lacked pertinent facts, which he was not asking for, but Soviets were in possession of all facts and hence in better position to determine available steps.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> inquired whether exchange of information regarding sale of arms to other countries was sought. Secretary replied that he had drawn <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>’s attention to two facts. In reply to <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>’s question he had merely observed that if Soviet program for delivery arms to area was limited and this could be stated publicly, it would be easier to exercise restraint on Israel and American public opinion. He was not suggesting exchange of information.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> said there were no new considerations in Soviet policy and that there were no grounds for concern in view of small amount of arms involved, their purely defensive character, and fact transaction was strictly commercial. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> alluded to recent statement in US by Israel Minister whose name could not recall concerning preventive war. He said it would appear that threat was not from Egypt but Israel. Threat from this quarter also deserved attention. He also asserted that for reasons unknown to Soviets Western powers had ceased arms shipments to Egypt which certainly had right to look elsewhere for defensive armaments.</p>
                        <p>Secretary said that danger of war should concern us all. He was neither partisan of Israel nor Egypt but of peace and good relations with Soviets. He did not deny right of Soviets or Czechs to sell arms or of Egypt to buy, but some rights exercised without restraint or concern for consequences tend to produce bad results. US had limited its right to sell arms to Egypt and Israel in order to avoid increasing dangers in area. US is now strongly urged to sell Israel comparable quantity of arms Egypt had received. This question must be decided but anything US did would be solely for purpose preserving peace in area. He hoped <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> would ponder two aspects of situation which he had raised.</p>

(Princeton University Library, Dulles Papers) The memorandum of this conversation is not printed.

Said <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss> would submit arms purchase list pronouncedly defensive in nature: anti-aircraft, anti-artillery, anti-submarine. He asked whether <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss> could expect purchase such arms on existent terms. Re <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss> request for border guarantee by West, <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss> in situation of thereby hurting relations with Soviet Union and thus diminishing chances of Jews leaving Iron Curtain countries, while unable to obtain guarantee from Western powers. He said <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss> would additionally like definite indication whether security guarantee to be forthcoming, since, if not, it would have to place greater reliance than ever on its arms. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> said <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss> would prefer US not send arms to Iraq but if it does would prefer to have US join Baghdad Pact and be in position to supervise them; assumed that if US joins Baghdad Pact it would at least simultaneously give security guarantee to Israel.</p>

                        <p>Secretary said American foreign policy has as one of its constituent elements the survival of Israel. Not aware of any policy we might adopt that would lessen that. That should be a factor of importance to Israel and a matter of hope. While <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss> may be impatient with US for not expressing it more quickly and emphatically it must remain a source of satisfaction to Israel. Naturally our foreign policy based on securing interests of US. In face of development such as Soviet-Egypt deal we must think not only of Israel but of viability of Western Europe, of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and free world generally. We are developing our policy. All factors not yet entirely clear. Not sure Arabs intend attack and destroy Israel. We must ascertain whether such a purpose has crystallized, and, if not, how prevent it. Re arms for Israel, cannot give answer here. Must be considered by Defense Department and Cabinet. We will give sympathetic consideration. With respect security guarantee, original soundings re Congressional attitude not encouraging nor is it clear executive would urge one on Congress in present state of affairs. Questions of borders and security guarantee hard to divorce. Have crossed bridge of saying will recommend guarantee of borders in context of settlement. That in itself is major step. Do not believe wise for any of us to talk too much at this time about new security guarantee. If <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> compels Secretary say yes or no now, answer must be no because answer cannot be yes for reasons given. This does not mean that it would be in any way wise for Israel starting preventive war. US good will is great asset for Israel and preventive war would injure it. Secretary emphasized that greatest danger is that of one border incident leading to another with a crescendo culminating in war, and urged <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss> do everything in its power to stop this process of events. In answer <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>’s query re any deterrents Western powers had over Arabs, Secretary said economy of Arab countries dependent on exports, notably oil and cotton. Egypt needs Sudan agreement of Nile waters. Many reasons why Arabs should work with US and they must know they will lose greatly with US by attacking Israel.</p>
                        <p>Secretary concluded that he knew above US position not entirely satisfactory to <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss> but hoped it would be substantially so and that <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss> would give careful thought frontier problem.<note n="4" xml:id="d371fn4">

Secretary told them he had emphasized two points. Quite apart from juridical aspects of sales: (1) such sales increase danger in area, and (2) increase anti-Soviet feeling in US. Secretary said he refused enter into argument with <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> about right to sell arms but was simply pointing out two factors. In reply <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>’s question re usefulness of exchange of information or whether we had any suggestions to make, Secretary had stated we do not know facts as, for instance, whether sales to Egypt … are isolated instances or whether program would be expanded throughout Middle East. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> did not reply these questions.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> reported he had taken about same line in his talk with <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> but in a formal way at request his Prime Minister. He had referred to <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>’s October 27 and 28 conference statements re arms race and had asked why, if such a race was dangerous in Europe, it was not similarly dangerous in Middle East. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> had talked about anti-Soviet Middle East pacts and of desirability of exchange of information, also requesting suggestions. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> had pointed out inconsistency calling for application of spirit of Geneva in one part of the world and disregarding it in another.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> observed Egyptian transaction more than commercial since must be assumed Egypt has not means to purchase and must be counting on obtaining wider support as well as assistance through Communist experts. Secretary mentioned danger introduction Soviet submarines in Mediterranean.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said that after our protest we were in somewhat of dilemma. We should avoid making Soviets partners in Middle Eastern affairs. On other hand, might be practical if we could tie them down to specific consideration Egyptian-Palestine question, but would be dangerous if we brought Soviets into complete range Middle East affairs. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said next move presented difficulties.</p>

                        <p>393. Re Palestine in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. During meeting with <persName>Dixon</persName> (<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>) and <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> (France) held at British request this noon, it was agreed that we should seek to determine what position of Secretary General and General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> was on desirability having Council meeting in light of present situation at El Auja. We also discussed problem created by likely injection into any <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> debate of Soviet arms deal with Egypt.</p>
                        <p>At meeting this afternoon with <persName>Burns</persName> and Hammarskjold present we considered private report in nature of “Program of Action” made by General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> to Secretary General, text of which contained in immediately following telegram.<note n="2" xml:id="d374fn2">Telegram 394 from <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss>, October 31, not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> Central Files, 674.84A/10–3155)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Purpose of “Program of Action” in Secretary General’s words was to seek practical answers to developing situation between Egypt and Israel. Hammarskjold felt solution lay more in direct implementation of this program by <persName>Burns</persName> with parties supported by vigorous joint démarches by <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, France and US Ambassadors in two capitals. He felt it was hopeless to attempt negotiate in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> since parties would only freeze positions in any public debate.</p>
                        <p>Secretary General also felt <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> meeting now undesirable because, while Egypt might agree to implementation of <persName>Burns</persName>’ “Program of Action” without insisting that Israel withdraw Kibbutz from <gloss target="#t_DZ1">DZ</gloss>, if matter discussed in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> they would most assuredly point out paramilitary character of Kibbutz and demand its withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>Since Israel would obviously refuse to do this, whole program would fall. He did not rule out, however, possibility of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> action confirming this program of General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> if in circumstances as they develop this seemed desirable or necessary.</p>
                        <p>Hammarskjold regards this program as a coordinated approach for which agreement of three governments necessary and no action will be taken on it until comments and concurrence of three governments available.</p>
                        <p>Hammarskjold envisages that three points made in <persName>Burns</persName>’ “Program of Action” be put forward essentially as a simultaneous and unified proposal which, however, could be implemented in certain <pb xml:id="pg_688" n="688" facs="0716"/>logical steps. He therefore believes that General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> should proceed from point three, that the old international frontier be demarcated. This idea could be acceptable to Israelis if done by <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss>, acting alone, provided they silently acquiesced in it and did not openly push their claims, which <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> regards as very weak, for sovereignty over present demilitarized zone up to old international frontier.</p>
                        <p>Second logical step of program would be point two, i.e., withdrawal by Egypt of checkposts which are now on Israeli side of old frontier line and in <gloss target="#t_DZ1">DZ</gloss>. From his talks with <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> (Egypt) Hammarskjold believes Egyptians realize that once frontier has been marked by <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, position their checkposts beyond it will be untenable and they can see their way clear to withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>Thereafter point one of program could be implemented, i.e., withdrawal by Israel of military personnel in excess of Kibbutz inhabitants and civilian police who were present prior to 26 August. General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> at several points in discussion emphasized strongly necessity of complete and immediate backing of his action with parties by tripartite approaches in capitals.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that three delegations would transmit text of “Program of Action” to their governments for instructions. I said we should not decide in principle against having <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> meeting nor should we prejudice General Bum’s efforts in implementing his program by premature meeting. Continuing to speak personally I felt it might be desirable to start with General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> implementing his program. Meanwhile we could jointly consider desirability of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> meeting with attendant publicity if that appeared in the circumstances to be desirable. Hammarskjold said he agreed 100 per cent with this approach. It was understood that <persName>Burns</persName> would not undertake any action on his program until comments and concurrence of three governments had been received.</p>
                        <p>Request Department’s comments on suggested plan of action.</p>

                        <p>At Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>’s dinner the only significant conversation that took place was with reference to the Near East situation. I referred to the visit which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> had just paid on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d375fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> met on October 31; see <ref target="#d377">Document 377</ref>.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> expressed the view that <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> was somewhat passionate in his presentation and wondered how strong a character he was. I said that I felt that he had considerable influence; that probably he was not as strong a man as <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> (although I did not know the present state of <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>’s health) and that <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> represented the more moderate elements who were opposed to a preventive war.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> said that he could not see any advantage to Israel in a preventive war. I said that I agreed but that there were many people in Israel who felt that they should strike while they still had superior power and not wait until they could be swamped by the superior manpower and armament of the Arab States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> said he did not see that the Arab States would want to try to destroy Israel. I said that many, including some of considerable authority, professed that to be their desire. I said that all this was the result of arms shipments being made from the Soviet bloc to Egypt and probably other Arab States. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> said that he was convinced that no aggressive purpose was in the minds of the Arabs and that if they should make an armed attack on Israel, they would be stopped by other nations through the means of the United Nations which afforded protection to Israel.</p>
                        <p>I said that many of the Arabs seemed now to believe that the Soviet Union would veto any resolution directed against them so that they would get immunity. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> said that the Soviet Union would abide by the principles of the United Nations.<note n="3" xml:id="d375fn3">

                        <p>Following is draft text of letter which Hammarskjold would send to Egyptian and Israeli reps for transmission to their governments. He has given this to us so that our comments can be directed to the precise wording of the letter, rather than to the “Program of Action” contained ourtel 394:</p>
                        <p>“The situation which has developed in the El Auja Demilitarized Zone and nearby as a result of successive violations by both parties of the provisions of Art VIII of the Egyptian-Israeli General Armistice Agreement puts the parties concerned and the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> under the obligation to cooperate in order to eliminate without delay the direct causes for the increase in tension.</p>
                        <p>Present tensions and the risk of further serious incidents in the area will be reduced if immediate effect is given to the following three points:</p>
                        <p>(1) Completion of the marking of the old Egyptian-Palestine frontier along the western boundary of the Demilitarized Zone;</p>
                        <p>(2) Withdrawal by Egypt of all checkposts and defended posts, comprising personnel, obstacles and mines, from all positions within the Demilitarized Zone;</p>
                        <p>(3) Simultaneous withdrawal by Israel of all personnel in excess of the inhabitants of Kubbutz Ksiot and the thirty civilian police allowed for the protection of civilian activities, and the removal of all obstacles and mines.</p>
                        <p>The marking should be done by the <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> alone. The purpose of this marking is to define a clear line of separation between the personnel under the control of one party and those under the control of the other. Such marking, or the way in which it is undertaken, in no way affects the rights of the parties under para 3 of Art IV<note n="4" xml:id="d376fn4">Article 4(3) of the Egypt–Israel General Armistice Agreement (U.N. doc. <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>/1264/–Corr. 1 and Add. 1) stated that the Armistice Agreement was only a military document, that its provisions were valid only for the duration of the armistice, and the the purpose of its provisions was not to establish, to strengthen, to weaken, or to nullify, in any way, any territorial, custodial, or other rights, claims, or interests of either Egypt or Israel in the area of Palestine.</note> and <pb xml:id="pg_691" n="691" facs="0719"/>para 2 of Art V<note n="5" xml:id="d376fn5">Article 5(2) of the Egypt–Israel General Armistice Agreement (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>) asserted that the Armistice Demarcation Line was not to be construed to be a political or territorial boundary, nor was it to prejudice the rights, claims, and positions of either Egypt or Israel in any final settlement of the Palestine question.</note> of the Egyptian-Israeli General Armistice Agreement.</p>
                        <p>In order that these proposals may be implemented and to ensure against further breaches of the General Armistice Agreement, both parties should give specific assurances that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> military observers will have full freedom of movement and observation.</p>
                        <p>In the absence of General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName>, who is en route to Palestine, I have the honor to transmit the proposals to the Govt of Israel (Egypt) on his behalf as well as on my own.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName>, or his rep at the <gloss target="#t_TSO1">TSO</gloss> Hqs at Jerusalem, would be glad to receive at the earliest possible moment the agreement of your govt to the measures proposed. Upon receipt of the assent of both parties, immediate arrangements will be made for their timing and execution.”</p>

Egypt, small and defenseless country, had asked Soviet Union for arms and since Egypt could not get them elsewhere obviously duty of <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to help which it had done without any conditions. Soviet Union had witnessed Turko-Iraq Pact accession to it of Great Britain and talk that US would join. <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, therefore, obviously had to do something. Shortly thereafter <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>
                            <pb xml:id="pg_692" n="692" facs="0720"/>asserted sale was pure commercial transaction between Czechs and Egypt and Israel, therefore, had no right to complain.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> said Israel desired close and friendly relations with Soviet Union and <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> replied she could have them any time she wanted (presumably by giving up reliance upon Western Powers for security). <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> also made point Israel not friendless and alone as <persName>Dulles</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> had been working for it with him here at Geneva. At one point <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> without amplifying suggested maybe there should be conference of some kind to talk over situation. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> had impression discussions and press of last few days had possibly made some impact on <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> as affecting <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> position as advocate of peace.</p>
                        <p>Representative of press informed US delegate that Israel press correspondent later pressed member of Israel delegation hard on question whether <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> had specifically asked <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> for Soviet bloc arms for Israel. Only answer was repeated “No comment”. Israel correspondent then said to American press representative that unless <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> could say in response to questions in the Knesset that he had asked Soviet Union for arms there would be no new government this week (presumably referring to <gloss target="#t_Mapam1">Mapam</gloss>).<note n="3" xml:id="d377fn3">On November 2, <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> announced to the Knesset the composition of his new five-party cabinet, which included nine <gloss target="#t_Mapai1">Mapai</gloss> members, two representatives each from the <gloss target="#t_Mapam1">Mapam</gloss>, Hapoel Hamizrachi, and Ahdut Avodah parties, and one member from the Progressive Party.

In accordance with suggestion from the Secretary addressees authorized in their discretion as appropriate to make points given below in discussions with officials Governments to which accredited. <pb xml:id="pg_693" n="693" facs="0721"/>Missions at Tel Aviv, Ankara, London and Paris should inform Governments:</p>
                        <p>1. US believes recent developments give evidence of determination by Soviet bloc direct its attention and efforts at subversion in Middle East as it has previously done elsewhere in world. Can be little question but Soviet bloc will endeavor exploit and extend its influence by shipment of arms via Czechoslovakia into area. US does not question right of Soviet bloc to sell or right of Arabs to buy. We do point out arms sales are never purely commercial transactions and have never been permitted by Soviet bloc except with political motivation. We also point out communism is and would be mortal enemy of Moslem religion and we assume it is not desire or intention of any of Arab Governments to collaborate with communist bloc in its effort at penetration of area.</p>
                        <p>2. US believes a rapid and large-scale increase in modern offensive weapons by either or both sides of Israel-Arab controversy holds great danger for civilian populations of area. US does not intend contribute to such a development. It has been willing provide moderate amounts arms to either side for internal security and legitimate defense. It will do everything it can to prevent all-out arms race.</p>
                        <p>3. Present policy US is in accordance with Tripartite Declaration of 1950 both re preventing arms race and prevention aggression by either side. Our policy re further security guaranties for area was set forth in Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ speech August 26. We have no present intention giving any special security guaranties other than in conformity with that statement and 1950 Declaration.</p>

                        <p>Told him I found you fully familiar with all aspects of problem here. Frustrations he had felt at what he termed lack of response on arms from us had [not?] been due to inattention to his problems. On contrary you held very strong view based upon intense study of area over long period of time that only salvation for Middle East was settlement of Arab-Israeli problem on peaceful basis. You had not felt injection from any source of arms in quantity could further that cause but that resulting tensions would only make settlement more difficult to achieve. If there had been difficulties it was only because we were dedicated to a principle we believed right and best for Egypt as well as all of us and not because we were insensitive to his desire for greater security which we fully shared.</p>
                        <p>I told him we had no punitive feelings toward him and that he must understand our concern went far beyond one specific arms deal. In fact we less concerned immediate dangers inside Egypt under his management than elsewhere in area where there were already weak and leftist-ridden governments. In view of this concern, he must not feel that question of our relations depended entirely upon acts by US. We were willing to proceed in full cooperation with him to extent allowed by public and congressional opinion as long as we convinced he would cooperate wherever possible against spread of Soviet influence through Middle East. This not only meant inside Egypt where he had direct control but also in refraining from acts that would further arouse anti-Western feeling or boost Soviet influence in weaker states around him. Also we hoped for his cooperation in seeking ways reducing great danger of early hostilities in area. Further we firmly believed settlement Arab-Israeli controversy more important to Egypt and area as a whole now than ever before. With his new strength we hoped he would adopt statesmanlike approach and be willing discuss such a possibility without delay. I said it impossible to separate High Dam, from a purely practical viewpoint from state of affairs that would be existent here over next ten years i.e. war or peace question of necessity for large scale military expenditures on part of Egypt etc.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_695" n="695" facs="0723"/>
                        <p>As regards tactics of settlement told him I speaking without directive from you but my own feeling was that it would be to his advantage if we worked together here rapidly to see if general understanding could be reached as to what might be practical terms of settlement. This would allow US to proceed from strength in trying to convince Israel she should make concessions. If through this approach problems could be reduced to one or two major items (which I thought possible) we would then be in a position behind him and could perhaps through intensive effort cause Israel to begin to narrow the gap between our positions and her own.</p>
                        <p>In the two and one half hour discussion following points of interest appeared:</p>
                        <p>1. He would be willing at any time, on highly secret basis, discuss with me specifics of settlement. If he and I could handle major aspects, <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> could be brought in on details.</p>
                        <p>2. He agrees that internal dangers of communism are increasing in Middle East generally, although he not quite as concerned as we re Syria.</p>
                        <p>3. He agreed to exert moderation on press primarily because of its effect on number (2) above. As matter of fact he had already taken steps this direction during my absence.</p>
                        <p>4. Intra-area arrangements with Soviets had not progressed as far as assumed. Egypt not as yet a source of arms to Syria and Saudi Arabia. Syria a very poor country and had little to offer Soviets commercially. Syria wished arms from Egypt but could not pay. He did not see that Egypt had resources to provide arms, for which she had to pay, to Syria free of charge. Saudi Arabia also in quandary and probably passing through crisis stage with us. He thought we should bear in mind that one factor here is that Saudis do not like to see much greater strength in Iraq. Saudi mission, accompanied by Egyptian, now in Western Europe seeking arms. He felt they were going through somewhat same cycle that he had done, and that they would not be able to obtain the heavier types of equipment they wished. He, only last week, advised them that it probably better in view of intense reactions to Egyptian-Czech deal that they [not?] try to deal with Soviet Bloc. He therefore advised they try again in U.S. He thought that they probably would not obtain satisfaction from U.S., partly because we would think their demands excessive as regards their capabilities. He then envisaged they will turn back to him and offer to pay him in foreign exchange for arms. Stated this would put him in a quandary which he would find it difficult to refuse. I told him general nature our difficulties with Saudis this subject.</p>
                        <p>Saudi troops not to be “stationed” on Egyptian soil as I previously understood. Some would come for joint maneuvers but he proposed to let no foreign troops, even Arab, be stationed in Egypt in peace time.</p>
                        <p>5. He hoped coming period would be one of less tension with America. He was not going to ask for arms; therefore that irritant had been removed. He understood we wanted to strengthen the north but hoped pressure would not be applied for new adherents at this stage. Told him I thought this our position but knew that others <pb xml:id="pg_696" n="696" facs="0724"/>felt strongly otherwise. I certain if general conclusion were ever reached that Egyptian cooperation impossible then very quick attempt would be made obtain additional adherents. This he took in understanding way.</p>
                        <p>6. He and Minister of Finance Kaissuny were about only ones holding out for World Bank in connection with Dam. He felt this most practical way of proceeding but there was considerable feeling his other advisers that World Bank for one reason or another would only stall and delay. Only alternative he mentioned was Western consortium.</p>
                        <p>7. Now that <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName> had asked Secretary about wheat<note n="3" xml:id="d379fn3">See <ref target="#d341">Document 341</ref>
                            </note> he hoped we could be helpful. He somewhat irked at <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName> as he had told <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName> not to raise subject with you. He concerned regarding U.S.-Egyptian relations and wished not to ask us for anything we would have to turn down because of effect upon his associates.</p>
                        <p>8. He did not know what we would do regarding economic aid in future. If we could assist Egypt he hoped our assistance could be turned without delay towards preparations for High Dam. He volunteered that if Egypt undertook this project she could no longer afford to devote her resources to some of the other programs on which we were now assisting.</p>
                        <p>In summary would say I found <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> more conscious of true nature our concern and apparently willing to make more of an effort improve our relations. His attitude with visiting Congressmen yesterday pointed decidedly in this direction.</p>

                        <p>There follows a summary of the discussion at the meeting and the main points taken.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Significant World Developments Affecting U.S. Security</p>
                        <p>[Here follows <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen W. Dulles</persName>’ assessment of the previous day’s vote of confidence in the French Chamber of Deputies.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">[Allen] Dulles</persName> stated that the Arab-Israeli situation had taken a serious turn for the worse during the night, though what had happened was not unexpected as a result of the reports from our Military Attaché pointing out the steady Israeli reenforcement of the El Auja demilitarized zone. According to the report received this morning, the Israelis had attacked the Egyptians in the El Auja area, and this attack had turned out to be the bloodiest encounter since 1949. 50 Egyptian soldiers had been killed.<note n="2" xml:id="d380fn2">Israeli forces had attacked an Egyptian position at al-Sabha, near the border of the El Auja demilitarized area. The Israelis claimed they had killed 50 Egyptians and had taken 40 prisoners while suffering 4 killed and 19 wounded. (Telegram 451 from Tel Aviv, November 3; Department of State, Central Files, 674.84A/11–355)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> then pointed out the level of Arab and Israeli forces in the various areas surrounding Israel. He indicated that the Israelis were now estimated to have 86,000 men under arms. This could be increased very rapidly to 200,000.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> pointed out that a report from the Military Attaché in Tel Aviv received this morning clearly indicated that the Israelis were mobilizing.<note n="3" xml:id="d380fn3">The Department of State received a report from the U.S. Military Attaché in Israel on November 2 that heavy military traffic was proceeding toward Negev, and that the Israelis were massing tanks and were establishing fuel and ammunition dumps. (Telegram MAI 849 from Tel Aviv; <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> 674.84A/11–255)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Vice President inquired what excuses the Israelis had given for their attack on the Egyptians. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> replied that the Israelis <pb xml:id="pg_698" n="698" facs="0726"/>had simply stated that the Egyptians had no business being in the El Auja zone, and were determined to drive them out. Both Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> reminded the Council that neither the Israelis nor the Egyptians had any right to put forces in the demilitarized zone.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> went on to point out that Israel was continuing to approach the various Western powers to procure armament or to induce them to put pressure on Egypt. The latest instance was a detailed list of arms which the Israelis desired to purchase in Italy. Tel Aviv has also made representations to the Czechs and Russians, as well as launching an international arms loan drive. Since they were likely to have considerable success in raising a loan to purchase armament, Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> was inclined to question the efficacy of financial sanctions in deterring the Israelis from launching a preventive war against Egypt. In any case, he doubted whether this course of action, affirmed by the National Security Council last week, would immediately bring the Israelis to book.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> concluded his comments on this subject by giving the over-all military strength figures for Israel and the Arab States. He pointed out that, quite apart from the matter of numbers, the Israelis enjoyed a very substantial advantage in terms of effectiveness, morale, and efficiency.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President inquired whether the Zionist leaders in the United States were in a position to exert any appreciable influence on the Israeli Government. Had we made any exploration of the possibility of inducing the Zionist leaders to exert such influence?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> replied by stating his belief that Zionist leaders in the United States would encounter severe difficulty in asserting a moderating point of view. While such leaders might have considerable influence on Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> and he in turn on the Israeli Government, Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> was not at all sure that the Zionist leaders could be mobilized for this purpose. Many of them regard this as a life-and-death struggle for Israel.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> supported Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>’ doubts in this matter. He indicated that there was no unanimity of feeling among Zionist leaders in the United States. Some of them were greatly concerned about extremist action by the Israeli Government. Others took a very emotional view of the situation. It was hard to say whether these leaders could play a useful role in preventing hostilities.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows <persName>Dulles</persName>’ report to the effect that Chancellor Adenauer of West Germany was extremely ill and was not expected to recover.]</p>

                        <p>The Vice President said that it was hard to understand why, after this conversation, the Israeli attack in the El Auja area should have occurred. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> commented that if there was a general Israeli mobilization the United States was immediately confronted with a desperately serious situation. The Vice President asked Mr. Andersen to explain that in the course of Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName>’s visit with the President on Wednesday<note n="8" xml:id="d380fn8">November 2.</note> the latter had concurred in the recommendations of the National Security Council at its last meeting with respect to courses of action to forestall hostilities between Israel and the Arab States.

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> pointed out that the U.S. Delegation to the United Nations was now actively exploring the possibility of action by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council to deter hostilities.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> warned the National Security Council that it might be faced at once with the necessity of executing the recently agreed courses of action if it turned out that the Israelis were actually carrying out a general mobilization.</p>

                        <p>Commenting on Hammarskjold’s proposals, <persName>Dixon</persName> (<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>) said he was not sure it was now desirable to carry through with original letter to parties relating to El Auja situation. That letter had been designed to stop what had in fact happened yesterday, and he felt it was rather unreal now to send the letter in these circumstances. He felt that we could not overlook the fact that Israel had taken the situation into their own hands and believed that some condemnation should be passed upon them.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CPM1">Crosthwaite</persName> added that removal of the Egyptian check-posts which <persName>Burns</persName> had intended proposing had now been accomplished by force and he, too, thought the <persName>Burns</persName> proposals were now obsolete. <persName>Dixon</persName> concluded that <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> would have to act in situation, particularly since Israeli action was not strictly a retaliation and hence all the more reprehensible.</p>
                        <p>Hammarskjold replied to <persName>Dixon</persName> that he remained very doubtful as to the desirability of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> action but he felt strongly that a protest from the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to the Israelis was a “must” for today. He continued to feel also that the only practical course of action lay in <persName>Burns</persName>’ three points as contained in his proposed letter.</p>
                        <p>After considerable discussion, British and French agreed that Hammarskjold should address a letter of protest to Israel on his own responsibility and that the <persName>Burns</persName> proposals, with appropriate amendments, should also be forwarded to Israel and Egypt. They agreed, likewise, with Hammarskjold’s proposal to issue a press release referring to his actions.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> (France) said that French <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> did not feel that three powers should make démarches to Israel and Egypt in support of <persName>Burns</persName>’ proposals for dealing with El Auja situation, in view of fact three <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>s would be considering whole Middle East question. He did not object to Hammarskjold sending the proposals to the parties, however, nor did he object to having it known three powers had concurred in desirability these proposals “prior” to last night’s attack. <persName>Dixon</persName> agreed that if proposals were sent forward, three governments’ démarches would be deferred for time being, pending decision as to any additional action that might be taken.</p>
                        <p>I said I would have to submit to Department the final texts of Hammarskjold’s letter to Israel and his letter to both parties containing the <persName>Burns</persName> proposals. Hammarskjold argued that his final texts would be little different in substance from what we now had before us, but did finally agree to hold up issuance of texts until after we had been able see final version and receive and communicate Washington’s comments. Final versions as now received from Hammarskjold <pb xml:id="pg_702" n="702" facs="0730"/>have been telephoned Department and are contained in next following telegram.<note n="7" xml:id="d381fn7">

                        <p>In a letter from General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> of 29 October<note n="3" xml:id="d382fn3">See <ref target="#d367">Document 367</ref>.</note> in which the Chief of Staff spoke also on my behalf, your attention was called to the grave moral responsibility which would be borne by a party which, in the present situation in the El Auja area, took offensive action of any kind.</p>
                        <p>When I invited the Chief of Staff to come here for consultations an undertaking was given to him by the Israeli Government to abstain during his absence from actions that might aggravate the situation.</p>
                        <p>In a letter to you on an earlier occasion, I found reason to draw attention to the very serious view the United Nations must take of an interference with the activities of its observers, especially in a situation where their contribution might have been of special importance.<note n="4" xml:id="d382fn4">On August 31, <persName corresp="#p_CWEJ1">Cole</persName> reported that the Israelis had prevented U.N. officials from discharging their duties as observers by detaining them at Beersheba. (Telegram 66 from Jerusalem; Department of State, Central Files, 674.84A/8–3155) Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> in New York informed the Department that <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName> on August 31 had “summoned Israeli rep and given him an ultimatum as to … the detention of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> personnel.” (Telegram 191 from <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss>, September 1; <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> 674.84A/9–155)</note>

                        <pb xml:id="pg_703" n="703" facs="0731"/>
                        <p>This view was most recently expressed in the resolution adopted unanimously by the Security Council on 8 September 1955.<note n="5" xml:id="d382fn5">See <ref target="#d262">Document 262</ref>.</note> In paragraph 4 of that resolution, the Security Council, “Declares that freedom of movement must be awarded to United Nations observers in the area to enable them to fulfill their functions.”</p>
                        <p>I find it necessary to remind you of these facts with all emphasis, in view of the action taken by Israel last night.</p>
                        <p>According to official Israeli sources, an Israeli Army unit attacked and occupied positions established by the Egyptian Army within the demilitarized area. This action is all the more unwarranted because, as the Israeli authorities know very well, General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> and the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization have been engaged during the past few weeks in intensive efforts to secure the removal from the demilitarized area of positions established therein by both parties in violation of the General Armistice Agreement.</p>
                        <p>In a comment released by the Israeli Foreign Office today it is stated that “full freedom of movement in El Auja for United Nations military observers has been granted again.”</p>
                        <p>According to our own observers, they have been denied access to observation posts in the El Auja area during the night and they were also denied access to the Rafah, Ismailia and Birein roads. In a statement to the United Nations military observers in El Auja the senior Israeli delegate stated that only the Beersheba-El Auja road was free to observers but that “all other roads in the Demilitarized Zone and all the Demilitarized Zone area are restricted until further notice.”</p>
                        <p>In another demarche today I am putting forward, jointly with General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName>, certain proposals which in our view represent minimum requirements if order is to be re-established in the El Auja area and vicinity.<note n="6" xml:id="d382fn6">See <ref target="#d394">Document 394</ref>.</note> These proposals were discussed with General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> during his visit and prior to the latest developments. The possibilities of proceeding with these proposals and of achieving stability in the area are considerably reduced by the attitude of the Israeli Government most recently reflected in the military action yesterday.<note n="7" xml:id="d382fn7">
                                <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName> subsequently made several changes in the text of this letter. A copy of the final text is filed as an attachment to a memorandum of November 3 from <persName corresp="#p_BJW1">Barco</persName> to Niles Bond, Director of the Office of U.N. Political and Security Affairs. The most significant change was in the last sentence, which, in the final text, reads as follows: “The possibilities of proceeding with these proposals and of achieving stability in the area are considerably reduced by such military action as that of yesterday.” (Department of State, <gloss target="#t_UNP1">UNP</gloss> Files: Lot 59 D 237, Palestine—General Correspondence)</note>

At tripartite meeting November 2, on <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName>’s request Margerie reviewed French thinking re Middle East.<note n="2" xml:id="d383fn2">The memorandum of this conversation is not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi>

                        <p>He said all French relationships with Arab countries under shadow of events North Africa. While attitude of Arabs in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and elsewhere often not helpful or friendly, bilateral relationships between France and Arab countries continue on reasonable basis. As example mentioned there never so many Arab students enrolled in French schools in such countries.</p>
                        <p>He went on say problem is prevent other Arab States from taking same path as Egypt re receiving arms and aid from Soviet bloc. France never thought Baghdad Pact good idea and believe it one principal reason for Russian reentry into Middle East. However Pact was fact which must be accepted and problem is to prevent Arab States from turning to Soviets. France had still powerful influence in Syria and Lebanon. Lebanese fearful of Soviets. While situation Syria not good, French felt with some modest arms shipments from West, Syria could be kept on side of West. French believe Syria, Lebanon, and possibly even Egyptians, prefer receiving arms from France and West rather than Russia.</p>
                        <p>Margerie said French thought three Western powers should talk to Syrians and Lebanese and offer modest quantity of arms. From discussions with <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>, French believe Israel would agree modest arms shipments to Lebanon and Syria particularly because Israel wants Syria remain independent and not absorbed by Iraq.</p>
                        <p>Re Egypt, France would only furnish arms if latter adopted favorable attitude re French North Africa. By favorable attitude he meant Egypt must 1) stop inciting French North African Arabs by Cairo radio; 2) stop training commandos for infiltration North Africa; 3) stop smuggling arms North Africa via Libya. (He mentioned Libyans behaving well since agreement on Fezzan and beginning evacuation French forces from there.)</p>
                        <p>Re 1950 Declaration, French still believe it good policy because its basis is avoidance of arms race. However it a bit outmoded and <pb xml:id="pg_706" n="706" facs="0734"/>possibly three Western powers could expand it not going so far however as to guarantee existing borders of Israel. French also thought General <persName>Burns</persName>’ proposals on <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action sensible but believe it wiser not to support them by tripartite statement, but by separate démarches to Israel and appropriate Arab States.</p>
                        <p>In reply to query as to type arms French envisaged for Syria and Lebanon, Margerie said thirteen-ton tanks, some artillery, and mortars. Specifically, about forty such tanks for Syria. He reiterated France convinced with modest shipment arms and French influence, Syrian military could be swung from present dangerous drift to left. In reply question how Syrians would apply for equipment, Margerie vague, indicating Syrians had blocked Francs Paris and also transactions could possibly be financed through “Banque de Liban et Syrie”.</p>
                        <p>Secretary inquired whether France had pending any arms orders for Israel. Margerie replied affirmatively but said all shipments had been suspended. However position of Israelis difficult, and France believed some defensive weapons such as anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns should be provided.</p>
                        <p>Secretary said greatest danger in Arab-Israel situation is that war could start with no one being able determine responsibility. If <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> could make some arrangement for demilitarized area around borders of Israel so aggressor could clearly be identified, this would greatly reduce risk of conflict.</p>
                        <p>Secretary said it important that France, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, and US coordinate their activities in Middle East area particularly re arms shipments. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> fully agreed and said this important matter of policy. He had impression <gloss target="#t_NEACC1">NEACC</gloss> not effective in attaining such coordination. It low level committee which some paid little attention. Margerie said it had become simply group where information was exchanged re arms shipments, but often after shipments made.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> suggested in view gravity situation Middle East, might be well coordinate policy, including arms shipments, through diplomatic channels, with <gloss target="#t_NEACC1">NEACC</gloss> continuing serve as group which kept records, etc. He added if Arabs got into an arms race they would soon go bankrupt which was one of objectives Soviets, since bankruptcy and economic difficulties would lead to social and political deterioration.</p>
                        <p>Above meeting ended inconclusively with no conclusions reached on future activities <gloss target="#t_NEACC1">NEACC</gloss> or means by which policy re arms shipments to Middle East could be coordinated although it generally agreed effective coordination necessary and possibly could best be done through diplomatic channels.</p>
                        <p>In a later discussion Henri Roux, in charge of Middle East affairs in French Foreign Office, and presently in Geneva for a few <pb xml:id="pg_707" n="707" facs="0735"/>days, said he believed chances good of getting Egyptian agreement on three points mentioned above and that French would shortly release shipments of arms Egyptians had ordered and paid for but which French had held up because of Egyptian policies in North Africa.<note n="3" xml:id="d383fn3">The memorandum of this conversation between Roux and <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> on November 2 is not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> Secretary’s Memoranda of Conversation: Lot 64 D 199)</note> Roux indicated French policy currently is to try influence Near East Arabs to cease anti-French policies in North Africa rather than apply sanctions against them. Result appears to be less clearly Israel-oriented French policy in Near East.</p>

                        <p>Following is <persName corresp="#p_KSIA1">Kirkpatrick</persName> memo:</p>
                        <p>“Following premises on which our policy should be based:</p>
                        <p>1. Russians have deliberately elected open new cold war front in <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss>. Recent exchanges showed they are not to be moved.</p>
                        <p>2. We must therefore be prepared settle down long contest and consistent long term policy must be devised.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_708" n="708" facs="0736"/>
                        <p>3. Western policy must be based on need have most inhabitants this large area with West and on their willingness let West have easy access their oil fields.</p>
                        <p>4. Obligations of Western Powers to Israel under 1950 Declaration must be fulfilled. But Israel must understand West cannot afford estrange Moslems otherwise Arab States will come under Russian domination and it will then be impossible for West effectively protect Israel.</p>
                        <p>5. In coming contest with Russia West enjoys certain solid advantages. Not reason be stampeded into panic measures; or give Russians and Arabs impression we have lost confidence in our ability protect our interests.</p>
                        <p>6. In particular Northern Tier can constitute solid bastion of Western influence. Must be sustained and strengthened. Must demonstrate association with West pays.</p>
                        <p>7. Egypt is largest of Arab States and no Western policy in the Middle East which is actively opposed by Egypt will be entirely satisfactory. Effort should be made to prevent Egypt falling completely under Russian domination. If this fails we must try ruthlessly to isolate Egypt.</p>
                        <p>8. In meantime we must try prevent uncommitted Arab States joining Egypt-Syria-Saudi combination.</p>
                        <p>9. Finally must recognize it is Israel-Arab conflict which has weakened Western influence in Middle East and opened door to Russia. If we wish maintain position of influence with Arabs we must bring conflict to an end as soon as possible. This means strong pressure on Israel and also on those Arab States in which we still have influence.</p>
                        <p>If above premises accepted it would seem our Middle East policy should be on following lines:</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Northern Tier</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(a) The United States should accede to Baghdad Pact or at least declare its active support.</p>
                        <p>(b) Effective steps should be taken to supply arms to participating states especially Iraq. In particular advantage might be taken of forthcoming Baghdad meeting to announce creation of machinery (with US participation) to consider and satisfy arms requirements of countries concerned.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Jordan</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(a) Put concerted pressure on Jordan to join Baghdad Pact.</p>
                        <p>(b) Press Jordan to open direct negotiations with Israel for settlement of frontier.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Lebanon</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(a) Bring pressure on Lebanon not join Egypt-Syria-Saudi combination. Offer arms and a joint examination of economic aid. This should be done urgently.</p>
                        <p>(b) As soon as Jordan joins Baghdad Pact bring pressure on Lebanon to do same.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Israel</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(a) Israel should be allowed buy sufficient arms for reasonable defensive purposes. But it would be a mistake attempt match Russian deliveries to Egypt. This would not only involve US in arms <pb xml:id="pg_709" n="709" facs="0737"/>race in area but we should also have to give arms to Jordan to enable her to keep up with Israel. Question of arms deliveries to Israel should be subject Anglo-American joint study and agreement.</p>
                        <p>(b) Israel should be urged in her own interests try reach settlement with Arab States. If she is to survive, she cannot afford pursue policy which estranges Arabs from West.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Egypt</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Egypt constitutes most difficult problem. We should not write her off or drive her irrevocably into Russia’s arms. On other hand it would be mistake give impression blackmail pays.</p>
                        <p>Attempt should be made detach Egypt from Russia. But it would be mistake make representations to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> at this stage. If he were reject them, relations with Egypt would be exacerbated. If he complied, we should not be ready with measures to reward him and relations would once more deteriorate.</p>
                        <p>Moreover reports from Cairo describe <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> as being intoxicated with popularity which defiance of West has brought him. Moment does not seem propitious.</p>
                        <p>Finally, approach to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> now would be regarded in Turkey, Iraq and elsewhere as appeasement. Would be better fortify Northern Tier before undertaking any move in Cairo.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and US Governments should begin now to concert package deal which should be put to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> at first favourable opportunity after necessary preparatory work has been done. Following would be elements of package deal.</p>
                        <p>A. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> would undertake:</p>
                        <p>(a) Turn away from Russia on completion present arms deal, which would be a once and for all commercial transaction.</p>
                        <p>(b) Limit arms purchases thereafter to expenditure Egyptian economy can bear, having regard to regime’s commitments in social welfare.</p>
                        <p>(c) Agree open negotiations with Israel for settlement.</p>
                        <p>B. Western powers would undertake:</p>
                        <p>(a) License sale of weapons to Egypt within limits defined in A(b).</p>
                        <p>(b) Bring concerted and strong pressure on Israel to agree to just settlement.</p>
                        <p>(c) Finance cost of High Dam.</p>
                        <p>(d) Use such influence as they have in Iraq and Sudan to put Egyptian relations with these countries on sound footing.</p>
                        <p>These terms would be negotiable, but if <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> rejects collaboration with West on these lines we should:</p>
                        <p>(a) Refuse all economic aid to Egypt.</p>
                        <p>(b) Cut off all further arms deliveries.</p>
                        <p>(c) Endeavour isolate Egypt.</p>
                        <p>And make it plain to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> that we have vital interests in area and will shrink from nothing to protect them from Soviet encroachments.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_710" n="710" facs="0738"/>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Syria</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>… Syria is at moment so much under Egyptian influence that future of Syria may depend on developments in Egypt. We should consequently hold our hand there and in meantime give what short-term encouragement we can to our friends.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Persian Gulf</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Persian Gulf States are at moment probably only completely Western-minded Arab States. Represent Western sphere of influence which it is essential preserve from outside encroachment.</p>
                        <p>This is primarily a <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> responsibility.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Saudi Arabia</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Saudi relations with Egypt and Saudi plans for territorial aggrandizement at expense of Persian Gulf States and Aden Protectorate have caused Saudi-United Kingdom relations to deteriorate to point where <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> can profitably take no initiative. If progress made in Egypt it will be for US Govt to endeavor to induce Saudi Arabia to conform. But for moment situation warrants no move by Western powers.”</p>

                        <p>1861. Geneva for Secretary. Since Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AWW1">Aldrich</persName> dealt personally with the High Aswan Dam problem with the Prime Minister, he may well wish to comment on Cairo’s 868<note n="2" xml:id="d385fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> informed the Department in telegram 868 on November 3 that he had a discussion the previous evening with Minister of Finance Kaissouni about the financing of the Aswan High Dam. According to <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName>,<p>“British have been highly deceptive on this subject. As explained in longer message [telegram 879 from Cairo, November 5, not printed; <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> 033.7411/11–555] consortium plans to go ahead in absence of Nile waters agreement, knowing this stumbling block for World Bank. Our efforts to urge British seek waters agreement, and our offers to be of assistance in this regard, have in past been brushed aside. It seems to me their lack of cooperation on waters agreement, coupled with fact they seek our assistance in arrangements which exclude American competition, gives us basis for fairly frank talk.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 874.2614/11–355)</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> made special point that recent Egyptian action in “digging in” in Demilitarized Zone was first time Egypt had established and attempted to hold position beyond Egypt’s long-established international border sanctioned by armistice agreement. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> pointed out that even so, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> had assured General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> it would not take military action. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> could never assure <persName>Burns</persName> or anyone else that Israel would not defend itself if foreign power “dug in” on Israel soil.</p>

                                <ref target="#d384">Document 384</ref>.</note> We have studied <persName corresp="#p_KSIA1">Kirkpatrick</persName>’s informal memo on <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> problems and are summarizing below our preliminary views.</p>
                        <p>We find ourselves in substantial agreement with points made in British memorandum, subject to point-by-point comment which is set forth below. We are unclear however as to British views re timing and tactics of recommended policies. British memo seems to indicate present moment not ripe for approach to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> but that heavily increased US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> promotion of and support for Northern Tier should begin at once. Our view has been that strengthening of our friends in <gloss target="#t_NE1">NE</gloss> should not proceed in such a way at this stage as to alienate <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> completely. We have had in mind the sending of high level negotiator to Cairo at a very early date to discuss matters generally with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>. While we are not sanguine over prospects of <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s being willing or even able to cooperate along necessary lines, we have felt that another attempt would be made. If we conclude <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> will not cooperate, we could then press Jordan and Lebanon to join Pact; and consider adhering ourselves. Concurrently we could make strong effort induce northern Arab states reach agreement with Israel. U.S. thereafter if agreement concluded on boundaries could extend security guarantee to Israel.</p>
                        <p>Point by point comment follows:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Premises.</p>
                        <p>Agree generally subject to reconciliation of items 6 and 7 along lines set forth above or by some other means.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Northern Tier.</p>
                        <p>Re (A) We should defer adherence for reasons in para 1 but continue present active support.</p>
                        <p>Re (B) Since British sending <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> and Chief Imperial General Staff to Baghdad meeting (<gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 164<note n="3" xml:id="d387fn3">Not printed. (Department of State, Central Files, 396.1–GE/l1–455)</note>) we would recommend sending observers at level Deputy Assistant Secretary of State and G–3 Army or his Deputy. We note Turks are suggesting to other <pb xml:id="pg_714" n="714" facs="0742"/>Baghdad pact members that form of permanent U.S. liaison be discussed at November 20 meeting. Dept agrees increase in supply arms to Northern Tier states and U.S. participation in arms machinery and discussion equipment priorities initial meeting desirable in principle. However shortage <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> funds, other demands in funds, and fact Defense not yet prepared for such discussions at which commitments would be expected create practical difficulties. Going ahead will require high level decision.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Jordan.</p>
                        <p>We should follow present policy on Jordan adherence until after approach to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>. Pressure for negotiations with Israel should accompany or follow efforts to enlarge Baghdad pact.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Lebanon.</p>
                        <p>Unless situation changes, pressure not needed keep Lebanon from joining <gloss target="#t_ESS1">ESS</gloss> combination but we should not overlook this country. Believe military offer might be more fruitful and justifiable than economic though do not object joint examination of latter, and assume <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would participate substantially. Believe offer to improve facilities Beirut airport would do most of all to stiffen ability of Lebanese to deal with Syrians and pro-Soviet pressures.<note n="4" xml:id="d387fn4">For documentation concerning U.S. relations with Lebanon, see volume XIII.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Israel.</p>
                        <p>Re (A) Agree Israel should be allowed buy sufficient arms for reasonable defense. Would point out Israel making heavy efforts purchase arms France, Italy and elsewhere with prospects considerable success. May well be that Israel will confine her requests to U.S. for arms that can be considered “defensive” such as antiaircraft, anti-tank, and anti-artillery weapons. In these circumstances although Anglo-American study useful we would have to enlist cooperation of other countries in order to keep Israel arms at reasonable level.</p>
                        <p>Re (B) Israel should be strongly pressed to make boundary agreements with Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Egypt. If <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> unwilling Israel should redouble efforts with northern states.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Egypt</p>
                        <p>See para 1 for timing of approach to Egypt.</p>
                        <p>Re proposed undertakings by <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>:</p>
                        <p>(A) Egyptian payment for Soviet arms understood to be scheduled over a protracted period and to be made by shipments in kind. <pb xml:id="pg_715" n="715" facs="0743"/>Will be difficult for <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> to turn away from Russia and exclude Soviet bloc trade mission arranging shipments of Egyptian goods for some years to come. However we should request specific commitment re number technicians, additional purchases, and efforts prevent other Arab states from following suit.</p>
                        <p>(B) Limitation of further Egyptian arms purchases to “expenditure Egyptian economy can bear” would probably mean low arbitrary figure or possibly agreement by U.S. and U.K. to supply grant aid. View long term commitment supply cotton and rice to Soviet bloc plus fact high dam construction will utilize very high portion of rest of Egypt’s remaining assets, Egypt would have very little to spend on arms.</p>
                        <p>(C) Also should give more vigorous support to <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> proposals and agree to proceed with Sinai refugee project.</p>
                        <p>Re undertakings of Western powers:</p>
                        <p>Re (A) see point (B) above. Would require cooperation numerous countries in addition to Tripartite powers.</p>
                        <p>Re actions with Egypt in event <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> refuses cooperate: Re point (B) Dept has evidence of Egyptian efforts purchase arms in Spain, Italy and Japan. Cooperation of these and other countries would need be sought prevent Western arms deliveries to Egypt.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Syria.</p>
                        <p>(A) Agree.</p>
                        <p>… We believe Iraq might be encouraged proceed with economic pact with Syria, liberalize trade conditions and perhaps extend loan, i.e. for Baghdad–Damascus highway. Syro-Iraqi military agreement could involve Baghdad Pact more directly in Arab-Israel issue and should be discouraged for present.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_GOS1">GOS</gloss> request for purchase military transportation equipment remains under study and is example of short term encouragement that might be given to our friends in Syria.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Persian Gulf.</p>
                        <p>We receive continuing reports activities Communist, other dissident elements in Persian Gulf oil-producing states …. U.S. and U.K. however both have important interests there.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_716" n="716" facs="0744"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Saudi Arabia.</p>
                        <p>U.S. has large stake in Saudi Arabia and believes has right expect British cooperation in taking all practical measures to keep Saudis from turning from West. British action in Buraimi has created possible new opportunities to those who seek to destroy Western influence in Near East and is likely make adoption peaceful measures in settlement area border disputes increasingly difficult. Feel British should be prepared consider boundary policies on peninsula in light overall necessity maintaining good relations Arab states. We favor either direct talks between <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> and U.K. or resumption arbitration.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_Dulte1">Dulte</gloss> 55. For Acting Secretary from Secretary. Reported visit of <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> to US will pose for US a most serious problem.<note n="2" xml:id="d389fn2">The Embassy in Tel Aviv reported on November 7 that <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> was planning to leave for the United States on November 9. According to the Embassy, the “Principal purpose of trip is to address series of meetings in support of Israel bond and U[nited] J[ewish] A[ppeal] drives. First speech scheduled Chicago Nov. 12. Foreign Ministry indicated that <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> would spend two or three weeks in United States.” (Telegram 477; <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> 033.84A11/11–755)</note> It is obviously an effort on his part to go over the heads of our government and the position which I announced to him and to force administration into policy of supporting Israel to a degree and in a manner which will surely antagonize entire Arab world and allow Soviet Union to become dominant in that area. Consequences in terms of jeopardy to oil for Western Europe and in terms of Africa <pb xml:id="pg_718" n="718" facs="0746"/>are immense. On other hand it is very difficult for US to make publicly a case for not matching in arms to Israel Soviet arms to Arab countries, and at same time being unwilling to give any firm security guaranty to Israel.</p>
                        <p>I feel this is situation which only President can deal with and we should consider promptly asking him make statement of US position, preferably in anticipation of <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>’s arrival.</p>
                        <p>I believe our basic position should be that nothing has so far happened that leads us to revise our policy of being friends both of Israel and Arabs. We believe basic security of Israel can be assured through <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action which would be along lines of 1950 tripartite policy statement; that in view of above we do not believe we should commit ourselves to backing Israel in arms race with Egypt backed by Soviet Union, although we quite recognize right of Israel as well as Arab States to buy arms for defense.</p>
                        <p>Suggest you discuss this matter with President when you see him on Wednesday and if he approves this course of action, suggest Dept submit draft statement and if time permits send to me here for comments.</p>

Matter of timing of any US adherence to Baghdad Pact therefore one of considerable delicacy. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> urged US make every effort make <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> less popular, cut off economic aid and let him “stew in Russian juice”. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> pointed out effort to “purge” <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> might add to his stature internally such as had happened in cases Peron and Franco.</p>
                        <p>In concluding <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said he had noted recent inklings in press now was time force Israel make substantial concessions to Arabs since Israel frightened. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> emphatically reiterated Israel would make no territorial concessions. Derided Egypt’s desire for land contiguity with other Arab states. Said it was in Western interest keep Egypt isolated at this time. In present circumstances Egypt should not have land corridor to Jordan and if Arab-Israel peace were achieved Egypt would not need such corridor as she would have full transit rights across Israel. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> predicted he would not live see serious change in Israel’s frontiers.

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said he thought it would be a good idea for the US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to agree on the general line we would take in the Middle East during the next few months. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> agreed and said he thought Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> would be interested in a statement which he was suggesting that the President make from Denver. He read the proposed statement.<note n="2" xml:id="d391fn2">The draft is not attached to the source text. <gloss target="#t_Tedul1">Tedul</gloss> 71 to Geneva, November 8, transmitted the Department’s draft statement. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> Central Files, 674.84A/11–855) <persName>Dulles</persName> suggested several revisions in <gloss target="#t_Dulte1">Dulte</gloss> 63 from Geneva, November 9. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 684A.86/11–955)</note> He said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> is leaving for the United States in a day or two to make a popular appeal over the head of the U.S. Government against the decision on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>’s request for a special security treaty and for U.S. support in making available to Israel arms to balance those given to Egypt by the Soviet Union. The proposed statement by the President would put him on record against <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>’s appeal. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> is making a speech tonight<note n="3" xml:id="d391fn3">For text of <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s Guildhall speech on November 9 at the Mansion House, London, see Frankland (ed.), <hi rend="italic">Documents on International Affairs, 1955,</hi> pp. 382–385.</note> in which he will refer to the Secretary’s August 26 speech and renew Britain’s appeal for a settlement and its offer of a formal guarantee in the context of a settlement. It will say that the Arabs take their stand on the 1947 Resolutions and the Israelis take theirs on the armistice agreement and the present situation. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> will ask whether these positions are so wide apart that no negotiation is possible and will say that if the people of the area want peace there must be some form of compromise. The Secretary commented first that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> might want to say something about the offer of economic aid; and secondly, that <pb xml:id="pg_721" n="721" facs="0749"/>the Arabs do not want the 1947 Resolutions boundaries so much as they wish to base their negotiations upon them. The ‘47 Resolutions give the Negev to Israel. What <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> suggests therefore is that Israel be given some of the Galilee which the ’47 Resolutions would have denied to Israel, and that Israel give the Negev to Egypt.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> raised the question as to the extent to which <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>’s speech of the previous day, stating bluntly that the Soviets would not agree to all-German elections, affected our appraisal of Soviet intentions in the Middle East. The Secretary said it is clear that the Soviets are reverting to a tough line. The soft line which the Kremlin has been taking has resulted in problems and weaknesses among the Satellite countries. It must have appeared therefore to the Kremlin that the soft line had disadvantages for it in Europe while the tough line had proven to have advantages for the Soviets in the Middle East and they had therefore decided to forgo the Geneva spirit. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said he had not come to Geneva expecting agreement by the Soviets on Germany but he had thought the Soviets would permit the illusion of a possible agreement to continue.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said he thought that with respect to the Middle East there were two immediate questions: (1) the Northern Tier and (2) Egypt. The Secretary said that with respect to the Northern Tier it was obvious that there was tremendous sensitivity on the part of the Soviet Union about Iran. They were fearful that Western air bases in Iran might threaten the Baku oil fields and other important installations in that vicinity. The Secretary said that he had had some doubts about the advisability of Iran adhering to the Baghdad Pact at this time but considerable momentum had developed around it and it had appeared to be a question of now or never. We have got to recognize that if we are to have military relations with Iran we must expect the Russians to react. Half way measures will be no good. We should either handle the Northern Tier as a nominal matter or make a really big effort, somewhat comparable to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The Secretary said that he was not prepared to say at this time that the United States can put substantial resources into it. There are military considerations which of course involve our Department of Defense and there are budgetary questions which involve Treasury and Congress. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said that he thought we should move ahead vigorously. The Secretary said he thought he should point out that the United States would not in any event be able to foot the whole bill. There would have to be substantial contributions by the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. The Secretary went on to say that it was obviously impossible to work out a modus vivendi with the Soviet Union in this area at this time. They would merely think we were pleading with them. We should not, however, discard completely the possibility that <pb xml:id="pg_722" n="722" facs="0750"/>ultimately, after we have some firm policies and a position of strength, we might come to an understanding with the Soviet Union concerning the area. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> suggested that it might possibly take a couple of years or so. In the meantime we should do what we can with the Baghdad Pact. One of the first things was to bring in Jordan. The Secretary said that in his opinion there was a serious question about our urging any of the countries which border upon Israel to join the Pact unless they were prepared to make peace with Israel, which he regarded as doubtful. If we gave substantial military assistance to the Pact countries bordering on Israel, we would have no guarantee in the absence of a settlement that they would not use the arms against Israel. The Secretary expressed his doubt that Jordan, Syria or Lebanon would be willing to take the initiative in making a settlement with Israel. The two leaders of the Arab world are Iraq, which does not border on Israel, and Egypt. We are therefore pretty much dependent upon Egypt for initiative on the Arab side in moving toward a settlement. The Secretary said that <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> has taken the line that Israel would agree to the United States joining the Baghdad Pact if we simultaneously gave Israel a security treaty. The Secretary said, however, that he did not see how we could do the latter until the borders had been agreed upon. The key to the whole problem is a settlement. If <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> fails in his efforts to go over the head of the U.S. Government, Israel might agree to a settlement. On the other hand, Israel might wait until after the U.S. elections next year. It would hope to secure the support of the Democratic Party and hope for a Democratic victory. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said that every year Israel waits before making a settlement its situation will get worse as the imbalance of arms becomes greater.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that whether to let the Baghdad Pact simmer or to go ahead with it in a big way is a difficult question. It does not have a solid foundation. Neither Iran nor Iraq has great political stability. Of course it is true that giving military aid may help create political strength but then it becomes necessary to give economic aid too. Iran is economically badly off and so is Pakistan. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said that Britain might go ahead then with the Pact and the United States will decide on its position.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Israel, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said that he believed our policy should be to give arms on the basis that we would have given them before the Soviet-Egypt arms deal. The Secretary said that the United States may wish to give them a little more since actually they have been buying very little indeed from us. He said we should have some consultation on any arms which any of the Tripartite Powers propose to send, not merely continue an ex post facto adding machine operation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said he thought the problem <pb xml:id="pg_723" n="723" facs="0751"/>should be handled in Washington at an ambassadorial level. The Secretary expressed his strong belief that Italy should be brought into the discussions. It would help Italian morale and strengthen the government there. It would also help to strengthen the arms controls. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> suggested that the Ambassadors of the four countries draft an agreement about the policy to be followed and then consult with the other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries. We would not give them a veto over any particular arms shipments but we would give them information and give them a right to comment. This should make it possible to achieve some overall coordination of arms shipments to the area.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> then inquired what policy we should pursue with respect to Egypt. He said that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> is presently riding high and would be difficult to reach an agreement with. At the end of a few months he may have sobered down and we might at that time go to him with a package deal. In the meantime, we should be working out between us what the nature of that package would be. We wish from him an undertaking to turn away from the Soviets and to cooperate in preventing further Communist penetration in the area; and also to cooperate on working out an Israel-Arab settlement. In return we would agree to help in the construction of the Aswan Dam both financially and in securing Sudanese agreement on the Nile waters. We would also bring pressure on Israel to agree to a reasonable settlement. The Secretary commented that the Sudan might be the key to the situation. He assumed that the Aswan Dam could not go forward without Sudanese concurrence and that it would be impossible for <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> to get the latter without Britain’s cooperation. He thought that even during the period immediately ahead talks with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> on the Aswan Dam should continue. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said that the British Government had concluded that it would be impossible to build the dam other than through the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>. The Secretary said that he did not believe that anyone, including the Soviets, would find it feasible to begin work on the dam until there had been an agreement with the Sudan and a settlement of the Israel-Arab problem.</p>

                        <p>Although opportunities have presented themselves, have felt should not carry subject further in view of injunction placed upon me to restrict my talks here to generalities pending further instructions.

                        <p>Although am not hopeful as to any immediate outcome, can see from here no harm in trying without delay ascertain whether Egypt willing to talk seriously about terms of settlement and as to how matter might be approached. On other hand may well be harmful to fail to respond Egyptian proposal. Do not feel in need of detailed instructions as old Alpha plan good enough basis to start except as regards Negev.</p>
                        <p>This point would hope could have considerable latitude to explore minimum Egyptian demand without any commitment our part whatsoever, as of course would be the case on all aspects of problem.</p>

                        <p>New subject: If it Department’s intention that we make really serious effort on Arab-Israeli settlement, timing blame for what <pb xml:id="pg_725" n="725" facs="0753"/>Turkey attempts to do in Arab world, would seem essential that there be more understanding between us as to objectives and priorities thereto.

                        <p>On November 9, Acting Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> met with President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> in Denver at 12:10 p.m. During the course of their conversation, which lasted approximately 20 minutes, the President and the Acting Secretary reviewed the current situation in Geneva at the meeting of Foreign Ministers and then discussed the status of Alpha. According to the memorandum of conversation:</p>
                        <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> told the President of the hope of the State Department to send Bob Anderson to that spot, first going to London to get lines squared off with the British, then going to Egypt and then to Israel. There are two objectives: (1) to try to get Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> back on the track; second, to try to bring peace to the area and revive the Alpha project of the Secretary of State.</p>
                        <p>“The President’s only comment to Bob Anderson’s selection was: you certainly have picked a good one.</p>
                        <p>“The Acting Secretary told the President that the State Department did not think Israel and Egypt would move within the near future.”</p>
                        <p>After informing President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> about the Soviets’ explosion of another atomic bomb and describing his conversation with the President of Guatemala, Acting Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> and “The President went over draft of statement to be issued on Mid East, in connection with Sharrett’s visit to this country.

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">“The Middle East</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">The Premises</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Our policy in the Middle East has been directed towards retaining the area within the free world, developing the oil resources, assisting the economic and social development of the countries concerned, ensuring an adequate defense arrangement for the area as a whole, keeping a reasonable arms balance between Israel and the Arab States working toward a settlement of the Israel-Arab dispute.</p>
                        <p>2. The Russians have now elected to open a new cold war front in the Middle East. Our recent exchanges show that they are not to be moved from this policy.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_729" n="729" facs="0757"/>
                        <p>3. In consequence we must be prepared to settle down to a long contest. This means that a consistent long term policy must be devised. There is no short cut.</p>
                        <p>4. This Western policy must be based upon the need to have most of the inhabitants of this large area with the West and upon their willingness to let the West have easy access to their oil fields.</p>
                        <p>5. The obligations of the Western powers to Israel under the 1950 Declaration must be fulfilled. But Israel must be made to understand that the West cannot afford to estrange the Moslems. Otherwise the Arab States will fall away, come under Russian domination; and it will then be impossible for the West effectively to protect Israel.</p>
                        <p>6. In the coming contest with Russia the West enjoys certain solid advantages. There is no reason to be stampeded into panic measures, or to give the Russians and the Arabs the impression that we have lost confidence in our ability to protect our interests.</p>
                        <p>7. Egypt is the largest of the Arab States and no Western policy in the Middle East which is actively opposed by Egypt will be entirely satisfactory. An effort should be made to prevent Egypt falling completely under Russian domination. Only if this is seen to have failed should we have recourse.</p>
                        <p>8. Meanwhile the northern tier can constitute a focus of Western influence. It must be sustained and strengthened. We must demonstrate that association with the West pays.</p>
                        <p>9. We must try to influence the smaller Arab States against association with Egypt or Saudi Arabia for purposes hostile to our policies.</p>
                        <p>10. Finally we must recognize that it is the Israel-Arab conflict which has weakened Western influence in the Middle East and opened the door to Russia. If we wish to maintain a position of influence with the Arabs we must bring the conflict to an end as soon as possible. This means strong pressure on Israel and also on the Arab States.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Future Policy</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>11. Generally we must continue to make plain to the people of the Middle East our policy of equal friendship and desire to assist in the development of the area. We must avoid being pushed by the Russians into a position of opposition to Arab interests. We must not start a competition with the Soviet Union to arm the countries of the area.</p>
                        <p>12. The Soviet Union. We should make no further attempt to plead with the Russians to abandon their present offers to the Middle East countries, although we should continue to make it plain to the world that we regard this as incompatible with the Soviet <pb xml:id="pg_730" n="730" facs="0758"/>pretense to desire reduction of tension. We should resist any effort by the Soviet Union to claim as of right to participate in decisions regarding Middle East affairs. Means should be found of assuring the Soviets that it is not the purpose of the Baghdad Pact to provide the Western powers with strategic air bases in countries contiguous to the Soviet Union. This must be considered in the light of the British position in Iraq. Subject to this, we should continue our efforts to build up a defensive system in the area while keeping open the possibility, when our position is stronger, of working out some modus vivendi with the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>13. Israel. Under present conditions the US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> should not grant a special security guarantee to Israel. Such a guarantee will continue to be offered to Israel in the context of a settlement of the Palestine question. This policy might have to be reviewed if it should develop that Egypt was working closely with the Soviet bloc and there was no chance of bringing about a reversal of this trend. In such an event the US might adhere to the northern tier and grant a guarantee to Israel at the same time.</p>
                        <p>Israel should be urged in her own interests to try to reach a settlement with the Arab States. If she is to survive, she cannot afford to pursue a policy which estranges the Arabs from the West. This will involve a willingness to agree upon some compromise between the United Nations resolutions of 1947 and the present armistice frontiers.</p>
                        <p>14. Armament supplies. We should try to arrange a coordinated policy of arms supplies to Middle East countries on the part of the tripartite powers, Italy, and perhaps other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> powers. Machinery to this effect should be worked out in Washington at an Ambassadorial level between the three powers. Consideration [should] be given to the question of associating Italy in this study.</p>
                        <p>Our guiding principle is that we should not seem to be moving in to supply Israel with arms on a large scale to offset those supplied by the Iron Curtain. The Western powers have in the past supplied arms to both sides under the principles of the 1950 Declaration and this should continue to guide our arms shipments to the area. With respect to Israel, arms shipments by any one of the Western powers should take into account shipments to Israel made or contemplated by other powers, and should reflect the security afforded to Israel under the 1950 Declaration. It should be our purpose not to allow a substantial increase in the striking power of the Israeli Armed Forces, although some increase in their defensive equipment should be contemplated.</p>
                        <p>15. Egypt. We should not write off Egypt or drive her into Russia’s arms. There are indications that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> does not desire to be identified with the Soviet bloc. It is probable that he envisages a <pb xml:id="pg_731" n="731" facs="0759"/>neutralist policy in which the Arab world, with Egypt at its head, would be in a strong bargaining position. His present attitude to the West has been affected (a) by the Israel question and (b) by his opposition to the development of the Baghdad Pact. We should not make an immediate approach to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> on either of these two issues. He is intoxicated by his present popularity and this is clearly not a propitious moment. We should not of course reject any overture <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> might make. We should hope that the next few months will show whether he is ready to mend his fences with the West and avoid further involvement with the Soviet bloc. We should assist him in this period by refraining from any punitive measures, and keeping contact with him over such matters as the Aswan Dam, the Sudan, and other subjects of common interest. The object would be to reach a point at which Egypt would be willing in effect to turn away from Russia as a source of arms, to limit arms purchases to her economic capacity, to give support to the Jordan Waters Plan, and to agree to open negotiations for a settlement with Israel. In such a case we would offer to supply Egypt with her reasonable arms requirements, assist in the financing of the High Dam, bring influence on Israel to agree to a just settlement, and help Egypt to play a role of leadership in the Arab world. An opportunity might be made at the November 20 meeting at Baghdad to make it plain that behind the defense of the free countries of the area provided by the Baghdad Pact it is our object to foster cooperation among the Arab powers for constructive purposes, and that this need not be confined to members of the Pact. Egyptian leadership in such an effort is not excluded.</p>
                        <p>If all this fails and Egypt is clearly lost to Western influence, we should have to consider policies which would minimize the harm which she could do to Western interests.</p>
                        <p>16. Northern tier. It is the intention of the United States to maintain liaison with the Baghdad Pact Council. The scope of the material support which the United States will give to the Baghdad Pact will depend on further studies by the US Government. These will take account of the sensitivity of the Soviet Union to Western military relations with Iran. Her Majesty’s Government as a member of the Pact will seek to establish effective machinery for cooperation among the members in the interest of common security. It is the intention of both the US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to give full public support to the Pact as evidence of Arab cooperation with the free world. Advantage might be taken of the forthcoming Baghdad meeting to announce the creation of machinery (with appropriate United States <pb xml:id="pg_732" n="732" facs="0760"/>participation) to consider and satisfy the arms requirements of the countries concerned.”</p>

                        <p>At <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s request I saw him this morning. He wished to talk about Israeli-Arab situation. He said there were two problems: (a) to prevent outbreak of war and (b) to bring peace.</p>
                        <p>Regarding (a) he referred to statement made by President in Denver on November 9th.<note n="2" xml:id="d398fn2">For text, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, November 21, 1955, p. 845.</note> He said that at a press conference this afternoon he is planning to say that this statement represents British view and that <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> entirely agrees with it.</p>
                        <p>Regarding (b) he referred to the following statement in his speech at Mansion House November 9th:<note n="3" xml:id="d398fn3">See <ref target="#d391fn3">footnote 3, Document 391</ref>.</note> “The stark truth is that if these nations want to win a peace which is in both their interests they must make some compromise between these two positions.” <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> said he thought that it would still further help the situation if President could take occasion at this time to say something to the effect that if Israelis and Arab countries expect to achieve a lasting peace each side must be willing to concede something.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> I would immediately convey his message to Secretary and Acting Secretary.<note n="4" xml:id="d398fn4">

Gist of message was that <persName corresp="#p_BRA1">Butler</persName> had told Kaissouni that British felt that matter should be handled by World Bank and that it was necessary to have the cooperation of United States; that obviously United States could not give financial assistance unless American firms were offered participation in consortium; and that he understood it was entirely satisfactory to everyone concerned to have Morrison-Knudsen participate.<note n="2" xml:id="d399fn2">The Department, on November 12, informed the Embassy in London that the United States had “not at any time insisted on participation by American firms in Consortium or in Aswan project.

                        <p>934. For the Secretary. Have no basis from here to form judgment probability Israelis may act in accordance Department telegram <pb xml:id="pg_735" n="735" facs="0763"/>964.<note n="2" xml:id="d400fn2">In telegram 964 to Cairo, November 11, repeated for action to Tel Aviv as telegram 340, the Department requested comments on reports to the effect that the Israelis intended to effectuate <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s overthrow by attempting to “drive to Suez across Sinai in endeavor to trap Egyptian forces thereby causing <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s downfall.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 674.84A/11–1155)</note> While making this reservation clear, told Secretary in Paris it my general feeling chances such Israeli action probably about 50 percent. Also stated I felt time estimate of some persons this stage might be reached in 4 to 6 months excessive, and that if it came probably first 2 months more likely.</p>
                        <p>We have some doubts that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> would topple now without really decisive destruction his forces. It would have been easy during period when he was hesitating about accepting Soviet arms.</p>
                        <p>It is perhaps worth repeating that if Israel takes such action we believe it will be widely interpreted in Middle East as our response to Soviet arms deal and that Israeli action either suggested or condoned by United States. In such event United States position in Middle East would be virtually untenable. While use of force dreadful to contemplate, believe in end we in all implications clear, American public would criticize us for not doing everything possible including use this ultimate step. Trouble is Israelis would probably feel that they could finish job before we could move. If this the case, and intelligence sources considered good enough, suggest we might consider supplementing warning reference use of force by indication we would close America as any source of supply to Israel, including transfer of capital. This would not be done during just few days of operations but extended to point of lasting detriment (this of course would be extremely difficult to maintain). Another thought is that we might say as far as we concerned she would lose her right to participate as equal in peace settlement. We would work one out with Arabs and use all resources our disposal force her to accept it.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">“Palestine.</p>
                        <p>I saw Minister for Foreign Affairs this morning and put to him the points in your two telegrams under reference. He replied as follows:</p>
                        <p>(a) He told me confidentially that the Egyptian Government welcomed the statement,<note n="2" xml:id="d402fn2">Reference is to <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s Guildhall speech on November 9.</note> and would be prepared to associate themselves with the task of seeking a settlement. He was not prepared to commit himself to saying on what basis this settlement would be, nor would he say that they would necessarily start from the point of the 1947 resolution. He said that the Bernadotte proposals of 1948,<note n="3" xml:id="d402fn3">For text of suggestions put forward by Count Folke Bernadotte, U.N. Mediator on Palestine, on June 28, 1948, see <ref target="frus1948v05p2">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1948, vol. V, Part 2</ref>, pp. 1152–1154. For text of Bernadotte’s report to the U.N. General Assembly of September 16, 1948, which contained revised proposals for a Palestine settlement, see U.N. document <gloss target="#t_A1">A</gloss>/648; excerpts are printed in <ref target="frus1948v05p2">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1948, vol. V, Part 2</ref>, pp. 1401–1406.</note> for example, might be more acceptable to the Arabs as a start. He reiterated the view, which he had previously expressed, that the Arabs would have to have the Negev, including Beersheba, and that they would not accept either Jewish corridors through an Arab Negev, nor Arab corridors through a Jewish Negev. He expected no difficulties over Jerusalem and probably no serious difficulties over the refugees.</p>
                        <p>(b) They would do their best to see that reactions to the Prime Minister’s speech on the press and radio were not too critical. He said that we must understand that it would be a tactical mistake for the Egyptian press and radio publicly to support the speech. Everybody would suspect that there was some conspiracy with the British, and the chances of making progress would be diminished. They would, however, try and taper off public opposition to a Palestine settlement both in Egypt and the other Arab States, and try to create an atmosphere which would help to lead to a settlement. The Egyptian Government would not issue any statement themselves on the speech, since this would be bad tactics at the moment, and would reduce the chances of working towards a settlement.</p>
                        <p>(c) They would not be willing to negotiate directly with the Israelis. Any form of negotiation on a multilateral basis which brought in the other Arab States would kill all possibilities of a settlement. They would, however, be prepared to discuss the details <pb xml:id="pg_738" n="738" facs="0766"/>of a settlement with ourselves and the Americans, either separately or together, in a way which would not attract notice. As they had said before, the conversations must be extremely confidential and known to those only directly concerned in London, Washington and Cairo;</p>
                        <p>(d) They would be prepared at the right time to “stick their neck out” more than was prudent for them, as they had in the case of the Jordan waters. For the present, he would do what he could cautiously to improve the reactions of the other Arab States to the Prime Minister’s speech. Incidentally, he wished to tell me, as he had told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> in New York, that they were doing their best to bring the Jordan waters’ scheme to the surface again;</p>
                        <p>(e) They would exercise the greatest restraint on the borders, and abstain from every kind of provocation.</p>
                        <p>2. Your instructions arrived just after I had seen <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> yesterday. He will probably be able to see me on Saturday. I think it better not to press for an earlier interview, particularly as he has to see Mr. Pearson and General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> tomorrow, and was very tired when I saw him yesterday. Moreover, by Saturday I shall be able to get a more useful reaction from him than if I were to insist on pursuing this with him immediately.</p>
                        <p>3. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and my American colleague are dining with me in a small party on the 6th at which no other foreigners will be present. Minister for Foreign Affairs agrees that this will be a suitable opportunity for an informal tripartite discussion. I have discussed this with my American colleague who also agrees.<note n="4" xml:id="d402fn4">See <ref target="#d416">Document 416</ref>.</note> I hope that by that time he and I can have instructions from Washington and London which will enable us to take the matter some way further, both as regards method of procedure and on the boundary question. On this latter question we hope that we can have general instructions, which will enable us to try and move towards something more possible than the Beersheba line, without committing Her Majesty’s Government or the United States Government.</p>
                        <p>4. We both consider that the Minister’s reaction was quite encouraging and that our best chance of getting anywhere is to proceed on the lines which the Egyptians propose, by confidential Anglo-American discussions with them. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s views may not be the same, but I have heard of a Scripps Howard report of an interview with him, published in today’s American press, which apparently records him as going surprisingly far.”</p>

                                <ref target="#d339">Document 339</ref>.</note> stated that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> must be destroyed. Department will recall that beginning last spring when Egyptian forces appeared to be emulating Israeli activist practices, debate within Israel Cabinet ensued whether <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> survival advantageous or otherwise. Holders former viewpoint have consistently lost ground and last vestige support for <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> disappeared with his adoption vigorous Fedayeen activity within Israel last week August and through other Arab States in September.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> military doctrine Egyptian presence should be removed from Gaza–<gloss target="#t_DZ1">DZ</gloss> area and Sinai Desert established as buffer between two countries as means increase Israel security is well known here. While this thesis has been subject both governmental and public debate, there is no evidence that it has yet been adopted as governmental policy.</p>
                        <p>Israelis have been hoping internal forces in Egypt, possibly aided and abetted by US would bring about <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s downfall particularly if <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> was to receive set backs as result of localized military activities along border. This has not come about and Israelis are bit non-plussed by failure of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to adopt more vigorous policy towards Egypt since conclusion latter’s Soviet arms deal.</p>
                        <p>Two sources of evidence which point to <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> reluctance inaugurate preventive action are: (1) reported Cabinet decision large-scale military procurement which appears to many here as alternative to preventive war if it can be executed and (2) failure Israel Army to utilize large-scale force available to it in south to engage Egyptian divisions in Sinai at time of recent Nitzana action when Israel had good pretext for doing so; i.e., presence Egyptian forces on Israel soil.</p>
                        <p>Although absence affirmative decision by Israel Cabinet appears to stand between <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> and large-scale military action in Sinai, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> reluctance to adopt such measure may be overcome by one or combination of developments. Firstly, adoption by Egypt of new <pb xml:id="pg_740" n="740" facs="0768"/>aggressive measures such as large-scale Fedayeen activities within Israel. Secondly, failure of Israel to obtain from Western Powers assurances of arms supply which will prevent shift balance of military power to Egypt. Thirdly, Western Powers support of program for territorial emasculation of Israel of such dimensions as to foreshadow Israel’s eventual obliteration.</p>
                        <p>Israel would adopt policy of preventive war with great reluctance and only if there appears to be no clear alternative. In event such action is determined Embassy repeats its belief that it will follow an incident for which Egyptians appear primarily responsible.</p>

At meeting of Secretary, <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> and Margerie (who said he fully authorized by <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> speak for him) yesterday<note n="2" xml:id="d404fn2">The memorandum of this conversation is not printed (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., Conference Files: Lot 60 D 627, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 583)</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> summarized <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> views with respect recent developments in Middle East as follows. Clear Soviets have decided open up cold war in new part of world and not going to be moved to give up that effort. Western Powers must formulate both short and long term policy. Matter of first importance for West have majority people in area on side of West.</p>
                        <p>Must of course fulfill obligations to Israel including those under 1950 declaration. At same time must make clear to Israel we cannot let Soviets gain Moslem world. This also to Israelis benefit as we cannot protect Israel unless on good terms with Moslems. We have strong assets. Most important immediate question is determine on policy re shipment of arms to Israel and neighboring Arab states. Western Powers should make clear not going into arms race.</p>
                        <p>As result ensuing discussion it was agreed that representatives of three delegations would draw up paper for approval three ministers<note n="3" xml:id="d404fn3">See <ref target="#d409">Document 409</ref>.</note> along following lines:</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_741" n="741" facs="0769"/>
                        <p>(1) The French and British Ambassadors in Washington, working with a representative of the State Department, will formulate procedures to maintain consultation with respect to arms deliveries to Israel and Arab states bordering on it. They should consider what functions the existing <gloss target="#t_NEACC1">NEACC</gloss> can usefully perform as a part of these procedures. In formulation of these procedures they should take into account desirability of including in such coordination shipments to the area by other friendly governments.</p>
                        <p>(2) Three governments agree they will make no shipments on contracts for sale heavy military equipment without consultation.</p>
                        <p>(3) With respect types of light equipment agreed upon, shipments may be made without consultation but there should be current and complete exchanges of information.</p>
                        <p>(4) Pending establishment of agreed procedures, existing contracts may be carried out except where substantial quantities involved. Information about all existing contracts should be exchanged.</p>
                        <p>(5) Governments concerned should continue accordance tripartite declaration oppose arms race between Arab states and Israel. As regards deliveries to Israel, however, not policy of three governments approve shipments in amount to balance current Soviet deliveries to Egypt. Would give priority to defensive equipment as opposed weapons of offense.</p>
                        <p>(6) Committee should draw attention of governments to cases in which representations might usefully be made to other friendly governments about supply of arms to countries concerned. In any event, committee should take into account shipments made by other friendly powers in determining upon advisability of shipments by any one of three governments.</p>
                        <p>(7) Committee should examine relative strengths in armaments Israel and bordering Arab states and exchange intelligence.</p>
                        <p>(8) Desirable full and early agreement be reached in Washington on detailed arrangements.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said we should not consider <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> as determined put Egypt in Soviet hands. While <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> undoubtedly feels he has scored a popular success and is in good bargaining position he is also probably somewhat alarmed by what has happened and time may soon come when he will wish return to closer association with West.</p>
                        <p>Margerie said that despite hostility of Arabs in North Africa and in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, bilateral relations between France and Arab states very good and political relations in North Africa improving. France has come to understanding with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> whereby it releasing arms which Egypt had already paid for in return for Egyptian agreement cease Cairo radio attacks and prevent smuggling of arms through Egypt to North Africa. He agreed game by no means lost in Arab world. France quite ready reaffirm its solidarity behind 1950 tripartite declaration.</p>
                        <p>Secretary agreed nothing irrevocable has happened as far as losing area to West concerned. Have two assets: (1) Arab states dependent upon West for sale of oil: (2) Moslem religion strongly <pb xml:id="pg_742" n="742" facs="0770"/>opposed to communism. While Arabs may be inclined play us off against Soviet that is far cry from their coming under Soviet control. It is US policy to follow along lines 1950 declaration. Secretary said he had made clear to <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> that if Israel started war we would have to take financial and economic measures against Israel. Israel could not exist long without governmental and private aid from us. We do not intend engage in arms race. We must all work hard for settlement along lines August 26 speech. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> strongly supported tripartite declaration policies.</p>

                        <p>Speaking under instructions, Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger</persName> stated that the U.K. Government wanted to “work through the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>” in connection with the High Aswan Dam, and said he was ready to talk with the United States and <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> authorities with a view to agreeing on proposals to be put to the Egyptian Finance Minister, Mr. Kaissouni, who is seeing Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> on November 23. He said he presumed that the United States would wish the Bank to take the lead in the matter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> said we did since, if we were out in front, we would be called on for assistance on many other projects in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger</persName> said his Government wanted to discuss: (1) the upper limit of the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> loan, (2) whether any “medium credit” extended by construction firms would reduce the amount of <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> loan, and <pb xml:id="pg_743" n="743" facs="0771"/>(3) what simplification the Bank would accept regarding international tenders. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> said he understood the Bank was thinking in terms of a $200 million Bank loan, that any credits extended by construction firms would reduce this amount, and that no time would be lost by the Bank’s requirements for international tenders since at least one year would be needed before construction contracts could be let.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> asked whether Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger</persName> thought the United Kingdom would impose any political conditions on its contribution towards the Aswan Dam. Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger</persName> said it would not but that he had been asked to find out what conditions the United States might impose.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> asked about the Sudan. Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger</persName> said that the Sudanese Government had fallen on the very day the last British soldiers left the Sudan and that some time might be required before another functioning government was in office.<note n="2" xml:id="d405fn2">On November 10, the government of Prime Minister Ismail al-Azhari was defeated on a motion in the Sudanese Parliament, and al-Azhari resigned. Five days later, however, he was returned to power as Prime Minister.</note> He said Mr. Kaissouni had proposed that “any additional water that becomes available as a result of the Aswan project be divided 50–50 between Egypt and the Sudan.”</p>
                        <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger</persName> emphasized that his Government regarded the Aswan project as one of the highest urgency, requiring promptest action. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> said that the United States shared this view and was ready to proceed with the talks. He thought, however, that a “letter of intent” by the Bank would take <gloss target="#t_CARE1">care</gloss> of the Soviet threat.</p>
                        <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger</persName> said that during Mr. Kaissouni’s conversations in London, the latter had urged: (1) that the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> accord a higher credit-worthiness figure for Egypt; (2) that the consortium increase the medium-term credit it was prepared to extend; and (3) that the Sudan hurdle be “got over.”</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that the meeting with <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and Treasury officials be set for November 16.</p>

                        <p>501. Eytan, Director General Foreign Ministry, yesterday evening gave Embassy his account of conversation Friday with British Ambassador here re <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s Mansion House speech. According to Eytan <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> version presentation of British Ambassador’s appeared to follow that set forth in London’s 1950<note n="2" xml:id="d406fn2">Dated November 10, it reported that British representatives in Arab countries and Israel had been instructed to approach those governments concerning <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s speech. The Ambassador in Tel Aviv was to say that <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s reference to U.N. resolutions did not mean any change in British policy but that the resolutions were the Arab starting point and that Israel must realize any settlement would require concessions. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 684A.86/11–1055)</note> to Department except for two variations: 1. He quoted Nicholls as saying that <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> had shown <persName>Dulles</persName> copy of <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s address and latter had said he was in complete agreement with it and 2. British Ambassador made no reference to Secretary’s conversation with <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> in Geneva.</p>
                        <p>Eytan said that two principal Israeli objections to <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s address were (1) that unlike <persName>Dulles</persName> August 26 statement which had placed refugee resettlement, compensation, and territorial problem in balance, <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s statement focused entirely on territorial question and gave scant attention to other aspects settlement problem. Secondly <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> had greatly complicated matters by his emphasis on <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution of 1947<note n="3" xml:id="d406fn3">General Assembly Resolution 181 (II), adopted on November 29, 1947. For text, see <ref target="frus1948v05">

V</ref>, pp. 1709–1730.</note> when in fact armistice lines had to be starting point because those were ones in existence today. Eytan added he had told British Ambassador that, while it was tactically impossible for Israel to take initiative in making suggestions re territorial question, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> was quite prepared to discuss it.</p>
                        <p>Eytan said Cabinet yesterday had decided <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s address should be answered by <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> in Knesset statement but that date had not been determined because <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> is ill at Sde Boker. He said Foreign Ministry had received radio inquiry from <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> inquiring whether Washington agreed with <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s statement. In view this and anticipation of other inquiries, would appreciate guidance from Department as to line I should take in discussions this matter. In <pb xml:id="pg_745" n="745" facs="0773"/>interim Embassy limiting its comments to those set forth Department Circular 318.<note n="4" xml:id="d406fn4">Circular telegram 318, November 10, instructed addressee embassies to emphasize, when appropriate, that the President’s statement “means just what it says and has no veiled significance.” (Department of State, Central Files, 611.80/11–1055)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>British Ambassador called on me this morning to comment on his presentation. He said he had informed Eytan that <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s speech had been shown to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> who made a few suggestions and agreed with it; that British were in agreement with <persName>Dulles</persName> August 26 speech and US agreed with <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s speech; that <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> was suggesting starting point for discussion of settlement without commitment on either side and therefore strong rejection of necessity of concessions by either side was not helpful; that mention was made of refugee problem and territorial problem was not over-emphasized although it is most difficult one.</p>
                        <p>He said Eytan inquired whether recent speech proposed <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> as mediator or merely designed to point up problems. He replied by referring to <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and US willingness to aid in every possible way, even on confidential mediator basis.</p>
                        <p>In summing up, Nicholls said he thought Eytan’s reaction less explosive than might have been expected and Eytan not in real argumentative mood. Nicholls will inform me of any conversation he holds with acting Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MGMG1">Golda Myerson</persName> if and when she calls him in.</p>

                        <p>5. As a premise, concept would be strengthened by addition of phrase “and Arab states” after “Israel”. Same balance, it seems to us, should be kept elsewhere in memorandum, for example in paragraph 14.</p>
                        <p>8. Concept might be broadened by addition of phrase “backed up by other states of <gloss target="#t_NE1">NE</gloss>” after “Northern tier”.</p>
                        <p>10. Western influence has also been weakened by slow pace of economic and political development in the Arab world.</p>
                        <p>13. Tripartite Declaration contains broad language and should be sufficient for Israel’s present needs. Security guarantee could probably go no further than Declaration but would be formal engagement and should be given only in context of general settlement. Egypt’s relations with Soviet bloc will be important factor in considering US adherence to Baghdad pact. In this connection Saudi Arabia, Syria and other <gloss target="#t_NE1">NE</gloss> states might also be mentioned because their defection from the West might have bearing upon US adherence to Pact.</p>
                        <p>There are possibilities for agreement other than “compromise between <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolutions of 1947 and the present armistice frontiers” which can be considered and perhaps quoted language is unduly restrictive. Such possibilities as condominium and trusteeships of certain areas might also be useful.</p>
                        <p>15. West could talk to Egypt now if Egyptians take initiative. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> continues appear very interested in economic development his country. We should not be forthcoming in giving to Egypt until <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> willing take steps outlined this paragraph. We should start devising formula whereby <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> while remaining outside Baghdad pact is able in some way to associate himself with it.</p>

                        <p>On November 14, the Director of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (<gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss>), Henry R. Labouisse, submitted to the 10th session of the United Nations General Assembly his annual report covering the period July 1, 1954, to June 30, 1955. (U.N. doc. <gloss target="#t_A1">A</gloss>/2978) Accompanying it was a special report covering the needs of refugee children, residents of the border villages, and other claimants for relief (U.N. doc. <gloss target="#t_A1">A</gloss>/2978/ Add. 1.) as well as a special report from the Advisory Commission of the Agency. (U.N. doc. <gloss target="#t_A1">A</gloss>/3017) Between November 14 and 30, 1955, the Ad Hoc Political Committee held twelve meetings for the purpose of considering the question of assistance to Palestine refugees.</p>
                        <p>On November 28, the Representatives of Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States submitted a joint draft resolution to the Ad Hoc Political Committee that would direct the Agency to pursue its programs for the relief and rehabilitation of refugees, bearing in mind the limitations imposed upon it by the extent of contributions, and would appeal to the governments of member and non-member States to make voluntary contributions to the extent necessary to carry through to fulfillment the Agency’s programs. It requested the governments of the area to make a determined effort to seek and carry out projects capable of supporting substantial numbers of refugees, and noted further the serious need of other claimants for relief. Finally, it requested the Director of <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> to continue to submit annual reports and budgets to the General Assembly. (U.N. doc. <gloss target="#t_A1">A</gloss>/AC. 80/L.6.)</p>
                        <p>On November 30, the Ad Hoc Political Committee adopted the joint resolution by a roll call vote of 38 to none, with 19 abstentions. (U.N. doc. <gloss target="#t_A1">A</gloss>/3057) At its 550th plenary meeting on December 3, the General Assembly adopted without debate General Assembly Resolution 916 (X), as recommended by the Ad Hoc Political Committee, by 38 votes to none, with 17 abstentions.</p>

Following draft of agreed minute meeting of Tripartite Ministers November 12<note n="2" xml:id="d409fn2">For a report on the tripartite meeting, see <ref target="#d404">Document 404</ref>.</note> prepared by Roux, Hancock and <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> for consideration Ministers: <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> have indicated may not be able give it their attention until following close of conference and will inform us through Embassies Washington:</p>
                        <p>“1. The French and British Ambassadors in Washington, working with a representative of the State Department, will formulate procedures to maintain consultation with respect to arms deliveries to Israel and the Arab States bordering on it. They should consider what functions the existing <gloss target="#t_NEACC1">NEACC</gloss> can usefully perform as a part of these procedures. In the formulation of these procedures they should take into account the desirability of including in such coordination shipments to the area by other friendly governments.</p>
                        <p>2. The three governments agree that they will make no shipments or contracts for the sale of heavy military equipment without consultation through such arrangements as may be established.</p>
                        <p>3. With respect to such types of light equipment as may be agreed upon, shipments may be made without consultation but these should be current and complete exchanges of information.</p>
                        <p>4. With respect to existing contracts it was agreed that, pending the establishment of the procedures mentioned, such contracts might be carried out except where substantial quantities are involved. The committee, when established, should give prior attention to the question of shipments under such contracts. Information about all existing contracts should be exchanged.</p>
                        <p>5. The governments concerned should continue, in accordance with the Tripartite Declaration of 1950, to oppose an arms race between the Arab States and Israel. As regards deliveries to Israel, it is not, however, the present policy of the three governments to approve shipments in an amount to balance the current deliveries to Egypt. The governments would give priority to sales of defensive equipment as opposed to weapons of offense.</p>
                        <p>6. The committee should draw the attention of their governments to cases in which representations might usefully be made to other friendly governments about the supply of arms to the countries concerned. In any event the committee should take into account shipments made by other friendly powers in determining upon the advisability of shipments by any one of the three governments.</p>
                        <p>7. The committee should examine the relative strengths in armaments of Israel and the bordering Arab States and exchange intelligence on this subject.</p>

Recalled long period of time necessary convert American plan for Jordan Valley to what Arabs would call Arab plan. Question was how could realistic Egyptian plan be defined and what assistance could we provide?

Who then was to first put pencil to paper so our discussions could take concrete form? <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> hesitated and evaded reply until termination of conversation on other matters.

                        <p rend="center">The Problem</p>
                        <p>To estimate probable trends in Egypt’s foreign and domestic policies and in its internal stability over the next few years, and to assess the implications of these trends for US interests in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                        <p>1. Barring such grave developments as assassination or military defeat by Israel, the Nasir regime is likely to remain in control of Egypt at least for the next year or so. The regime’s power will <pb xml:id="pg_751" n="751" facs="0779"/>continue to depend primarily on the support of the armed forces. (Paras. 19–20)</p>
                        <p>2. The position of the Revolutionary Command Council (<gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>) has probably been strengthened during its more than three years of control. Its arms deal with the Soviet Bloc has won the approval of politically conscious civilian elements who share with the regime a desire to build up Egypt’s military capabilities against Israel. On the other hand, most of the civilian population is apathetic toward the regime, and the more politically articulate civilian elements will remain opposed to the regime so long as they are effectively excluded from participation in power. Even if a parliament should be instituted, it would almost certainly be little more than an advisory body. Although such a reorganization might eliminate the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> as an entity, most <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> members would probably retain considerable influence. Nasir himself would probably be even stronger than at present. (Paras. 14, 18, 20, 22–24, 43)</p>
                        <p>3. Neither the Nasir regime nor any foreseeable successor is likely to make great progress in coping with Egypt’s fiscal and economic problems. Its export difficulties would become severe if a revision of the US cotton export policy were to confront Egypt with competition from US sales. Barter trade with the Sino-Soviet Bloc may provide a solution to Egypt’s chronic cotton surplus problem, but growing dependence on this outlet may make Egypt increasingly susceptible to economic pressures and inducements from the Bloc. (Paras. 33–34)</p>
                        <p>4. Even if Egypt succeeds in constructing the High Dam above Aswan, the project is unlikely to raise the Egyptian standard of living significantly, since the population will probably continue to grow at a rate sufficient to absorb the added resources without increasing per capita income. If the regime lost hope of obtaining satisfactory financing assistance from Western sources, it would probably seek an acceptable offer from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. (Paras. 35–40)</p>
                        <p>5. The fundamental objectives of the regime’s foreign policy are to be free of foreign domination, to acquire leadership in the Arab world, to strengthen Egypt against Israel, to establish influence in the Sudan, and to undermine the Western position in the Middle East and Africa. The regime almost certainly estimates that the arms agreement with the Soviet Bloc has substantially improved its domestic and international position. It would almost certainly not abandon this agreement in the face of Western pressure. (Paras. 53–55)</p>
                        <p>6. The <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> almost certainly underestimates the risks of accepting Soviet arms and other support. Growing Egyptian military and commercial dependence on the Bloc would increase Soviet ability to influence Egypt either by threats or inducements and would provide <pb xml:id="pg_752" n="752" facs="0780"/>added opportunities for subversion and political penetration. This would be particularly true if the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> should extend assistance for construction of the Aswan High Dam. (Paras. 38, 60–62)</p>
                        <p>7. At a minimum, recent Soviet overtures are likely to foster Egyptian neutralism. We believe, however, that the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> desires to avoid political alignment with the Bloc. In the long run, the main factors which will determine the extent of Soviet influence in Egypt are: (a) the regime’s own estimate of its need for Western support to insure its independence; (b) the extent to which the regime’s economic, political, and military aspirations are actually satisfied by the West; and (c) the degree of Egyptian satisfaction or dissatisfaction with Soviet performance. (Paras. 58–59, 63)</p>
                        <p>8. The arms deal has substantially increased the risk of Egyptian-Israeli hostilities, primarily because of the danger that Israel will take preventive action, but also because it is likely to strengthen Egypt’s militancy and eventually its disposition to launch a “second round.” Should an Egyptian-Israeli war develop in the immediate future, Egypt could probably defend the Sinai area for only a very short time. With the assistance of Soviet Bloc technicians, Egypt could have a limited number of tanks in operation in a few weeks after delivery and about 100 in operation within four to five months. However, about a year would be required before the new tanks could be effectively used in unit operations. Egypt would probably require at least six months to develop a significant air offensive capability against Israel. At least a year would be required before Soviet submarines could be effectively operated by Egyptian crews. (Paras. 48–50, 69)</p>
                        <p>9. The regime wishes to retain US friendship and support. However, its opposition to certain US policies, particularly those which it regards as favoring Israel or involving greater support of Iraq and the “northern tier” defense scheme will continue. Egypt would be particularly resentful of an Iraqi move to absorb Syria, and would hold the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> in great part responsible. (Paras. 77–81)</p>
                        <p>10. The Egyptian reaction to US moves to reassure Israel would depend on the extent to which such moves appeared to apply to both sides and to be designed to preserve the status quo. A reaffirmation of the Tripartite Declaration of 1950 would probably produce only a slight reaction in Egypt and the other Arab states. A convincing demonstration of US determination to intervene effectively in the event of aggression would probably reassure and restrain both sides, although Egypt and the other Arab states would regard it primarily as a guarantee of Israel’s security. If the US provided Israel with any amount of arms, even if labeled as being primarily defensive, or particularly if it extended to Israel alone a guarantee of its presently-held territory, US relations with Egypt and the other Arab <pb xml:id="pg_753" n="753" facs="0781"/>states would be severely strained. Such a US security guarantee, if accompanied by extensive shipments of arms, not only might lead Egypt to break off relations with the US, and even to accept a Soviet guarantee if offered, but would also endanger the position of the Western Powers throughout the Middle East. (Para. 82)</p>
                        <p rend="center">Discussion</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Egypt’s Present Situation</p>
                        <p>11. It has now been more than three years since the Revolutionary Command Council (<gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>), the military junta organized and led by Lt. Col. Gamal Abdel Nasir, and at first nominally headed by Major General Mohammed Naguib, assumed control of Egypt. Backed by the armed forces, particularly by a loosely organized group of three to four hundred junior and middle grade officers known as the Free Officers, the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> committed itself to a vigorous program aimed at achieving sweeping internal reforms, gaining and exercising full Egyptian sovereignty, and strengthening Egypt’s economic, military, and international position.</p>
                        <p>12. While the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> regime has shown remarkable ability to function as a collective body, the dominant influence of Prime Minister Nasir has become increasingly clear. Nasir’s personal ascendency has been consolidated by the elimination from the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> of certain members, such as General Naguib and the former Minister of National Guidance and Sudan Affairs, Salah Salem. The strengthening of Nasir’s personal position has been to some degree at the expense of moderation and good relations with the West, since he has had to rely on the extreme nationalists among the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>’s supporters in order to consolidate his control.</p>
                        <p>13. Nasir and his associates have had considerable success in crushing political opposition. The old-line nationalist <gloss target="#t_Wafd1">Wafd</gloss> Party, the reactionary Moslem Brotherhood, and the disunited Communists have been driven into a precarious underground existence by the regime’s effective ban on political parties.<note n="2" xml:id="d411fn2">The <gloss target="#t_Wafd1">Wafd</gloss> was the dominant party under the old regime, and probably still retains considerable appeal both to Egyptian nationalists and to the upper classes. It has also succeeded in maintaining its political organization intact to some degree. The Moslem Brotherhood (al-Ikhwan al-Muslimun), which was originally a purely socio-religious organization of Moslem zealots dedicated to reviving Islamic principles and combatting Western influence, later developed into a body drawn chiefly from the lower urban middle class, peasants, students, and religious elements who, in their political guise, favored the establishment of an Islamic theocracy. At its peak, Egyptian membership was estimated at 500,000, although probably less than 2,000 were engaged in its terrorist and clandestine activities. The Brotherhood generally did not take part in electoral contests, but represented a powerful force with which political leaders had to reckon. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> With few exceptions, the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> enjoys the support of the armed forces and those elements of <pb xml:id="pg_754" n="754" facs="0782"/>the civil service and security services which have benefited by the revolution.</p>
                        <p>14. On the other hand, the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>’s attempts to broaden its base of support have been relatively unsuccessful. The Liberation Rally, a political organization which it sponsored to provide popular support for the regime, has produced only negligible results. Opposition remains strong among urban intellectual and professional elements, the landowning classes who have sustained economic losses under the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>’s land reform program, and among former political leaders. Urban labor groups, at one time strongly in favor of the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>, have become disillusioned with the results of its program. Finally, while the regime’s land redistribution program has benefited a minuscule segment of the great mass of Egyptian peasants, and probably raised the hopes of others, there is little evidence that the vast majority is any less apathetic toward the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> than toward its predecessors.</p>
                        <p>15. This failure to secure more widespread support results from several factors. Having abrogated the constitution, banned political parties, and instituted rule by decree, the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> has inevitably incurred the resentment of the former parties and other politically alert civilian elements which are thus excluded from power and political life. Domestic opposition or apathy also results from the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>’s failure to meet expectations stimulated by its original promises to cope with fundamental social and economic problems, particularly the imbalance between Egypt’s limited resources and its growing population.</p>
                        <p>16. In contrast to its indifferent success in meeting domestic problems, the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> has achieved certain important objectives in the field of foreign relations. Chief among these were its agreements in 1953 and 1954 with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, providing respectively for the termination of the Sudan Condominium and British evacuation of the Suez Canal zone by 1956. In the Asian-African world, Nasir’s position as a leader was strengthened by his role at Bandung. The <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>’s claims to Arab leadership suffered a serious setback when Iraq joined the Baghdad Pact in early 1955 in defiance of Egypt’s efforts to maintain a common Arab front against defense arrangements with the West. However, with Saudi support, the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> has so far made Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon reluctant to follow Iraq’s lead. The <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> has strengthened its prestige in the Arab world as a result of acquiring extensive military assistance from the Soviet Bloc—a move which it regards as a success for its foreign policy and a step of far-reaching significance in improving Egypt’s military strength.</p>
                        <p>17. These achievements of the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> have not solved, and in some cases have intensified the difficulties confronting it in the field of foreign relations. <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> withdrawal from the Sudan and the Suez base released the other Arab states from the compulsion to follow <pb xml:id="pg_755" n="755" facs="0783"/>Egyptian leadership which they felt when it represented the spearhead of opposition to British imperialism in the Middle East. <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> withdrawal has also forced Egypt to cope with a number of problems from which it had previously been insulated, particularly in regard to the Sudan. Egypt’s vigorous opposition to Iraqi participation in Western-sponsored defense arrangements has cracked the thin facade of Arab unity, and brought Egypt into conflict with the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. It has also strengthened Turkish support of Iraq’s anti-Egyptian policy and has increased Turkey’s efforts to counter Egypt’s aspirations in the area. In the Sudan, the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> has been largely unsuccessful in efforts to replace British with Egyptian tutelage. It has so far failed to secure agreement with the Sudanese over division of the Nile waters. Moreover, the regime’s vigorous response to Israel provocations and its acceptance of Soviet Bloc military assistance have substantially increased the danger of war with Israel and have added to the strain in Egypt’s relations with the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>18. On balance, the position of the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> has probably been strengthened during its more than three years of control. Its members have gained experience, have eliminated dissidents, and have placed reliable supporters in key positions of the civil and military services. In foreign affairs, the regime has achieved sufficient success to demonstrate its dedication to Egypt’s interests and its determination to achieve results. If its domestic efforts have shown less dramatic results, its failures have not been sufficient to evoke any real challenge, and opposition elements remain disunited, suppressed, or ineffective. Nasir and his associates, however, recognize the necessity to produce results. In striving for these, they will be confronted with enormous, perhaps insuperable, difficulties, and may take dangerous risks in foreign policies.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. The Outlook for Political Stability and Political Policies</p>
                        <p>19. Barring such grave developments as assassination of certain key members or defeat in a war with Israel, the position of the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> is not likely to be seriously threatened at least for the next year or so. Personality and policy differences within the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> may lead one or more of its members to break off from the group, but Nasir and his closest supporters will probably be able to preserve their power within the junta.</p>
                        <p>20. The <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> is unlikely to make spectacular gains in achieving organized support from important Egyptian political elements during this period and its effective control will continue to depend primarily on the support of the armed forces. There is no indication that this support is likely to be weakened in the foreseeable future. The <pb xml:id="pg_756" n="756" facs="0784"/>regime has been successful in raising the morale and prestige of Egyptian officers and, as a result of the arms deal with the Soviet Bloc, can count more than ever on the backing of the military services.</p>
                        <p>21. Because of its dependence on the military, the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> will remain under considerable pressure to accommodate its program to the ideas of the Egyptian officer corps—particularly the opinions of the Free Officers group. Practically all of these officers are strongly nationalistic and anti-<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. Many, in addition to being hostile to the Western Powers, are also leftist, although there are few, if any, Communists among them. Their bellicosity toward Israel will make it difficult for the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> to be moderate on the Israeli issue.</p>
                        <p>22. The regime remains under civilian pressure to fulfill earlier promises to restore parliamentary government. Nasir and his associates may set up some form of advisory or puppet parliament and may also proceed with formulating a constitution—some plans for which have already been made. While little is known of these plans, they are apparently based on the concept of a strong chief executive. Reportedly, neither the chief executive nor his cabinet would be responsible to parliament, and the latter would not have the power to propose money bills or to question the basic program of the revolution or the measures of state security. The chief executive would presumably retain the power of veto over such legislation as the parliament could initiate.</p>
                        <p>23. Under such a form of government, Nasir would assume the role of chief executive. Most <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> members would probably continue to be cabinet ministers and would retain considerable influence in the formulation of policy, although the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> as an entity might be eliminated. Nasir and his two closest supporters within the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>, Zakariya Muhi al-Din and Abd al-Hakim Amir, probably would emerge from the process in even stronger positions than at present, if only by ridding themselves of their present obligations to act in concert with the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> as a whole.</p>
                        <p>24. Such limited concessions to constitutionalism will almost certainly not weaken opposition to the regime among its civilian opponents or broaden significantly the base of its popular support. So long as most politically conscious elements in Egypt are excluded from a voice in the government, they will remain indifferent or hostile to the regime. Such organizations as the <gloss target="#t_Wafd1">Wafd</gloss> Party and the Moslem Brotherhood will continue to work for its downfall. The ability of these opposition elements to challenge the regime, however, is likely to remain limited, since no opposition group can hope to overthrow it without significant support from the armed forces.</p>
                        <p>25. The Communist movement in Egypt is now splintered into three competing factions with probably less than 4,000 adherents. <pb xml:id="pg_757" n="757" facs="0785"/>Religio-ethnic minorities and youth groups contain the largest number of members, while students and labor elements are the principal sympathizers. Communist potential and standing are likely to improve if the recent rapprochement between Egypt and the Soviet Bloc continues. Moreover, this rapprochement may lead to Communist support for the regime, particularly for its foreign policies and this, in turn, could result in a weakening of the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>’s internal security precautions and even to Communist infiltration of the government. However, the indigenous Communist movement is not likely to pose a serious threat to the regime so long as the security forces maintain their present surveillance.</p>
                        <p>26. If “parliamentary” government should be established, even in an advisory form, it would probably lead over a period of time to increasing demands by civilian elements for further concessions. The regime would come under growing pressure to relinquish some of the substance, as well as the appearance, of its present power, and its foundations might gradually be eroded. The effectiveness of such civilian demands, however, would depend on the ability of civilian elements to win the support of a significant segment of the armed forces.</p>
                        <p>27. The development of strong and active civilian opposition to the regime would probably affect the loyalty of certain elements of the armed forces to some extent, but no such development is presently foreseeable on a scale sufficient to threaten the regime’s control of the military. For some time to come, the only occurrence likely to turn the armed forces against the regime would be defeat at the hands of Israel. It is extremely unlikely that Nasir or the regime could remain in power in the aftermath of such a disaster.</p>
                        <p>28. In the event of the overthrow of the Nasir regime, the character of its successor would depend in large measure upon the circumstances of the regime’s fall. Defeat at the hands of Israel, with the consequent discredit cast upon the armed forces leadership, would probably be followed by the establishment of some form of Wafdist government supported by elements of the armed forces and police. The <gloss target="#t_Wafd1">Wafd</gloss> probably still retains considerable latent political power. Such a government would almost certainly not be pro-Western. If an overthrow resulted from a combination of relatively less dramatic foreign and domestic policy failures, the successor regime would probably be military, with a constitutional facade featuring Wafdist leaders.</p>
                        <p>29. Though the Moslem Brotherhood might temporarily align itself with a military-Wafdist group in the overthrow of the regime, it is not likely that the Brotherhood would be included among the leadership of the new regime because of the exorbitant demands it <pb xml:id="pg_758" n="758" facs="0786"/>would probably make. The Moslem Brotherhood would probably oppose any regime in which it did not have a strong influence.</p>
                        <p>30. It is possible that the leaders of a successor regime might restore the monarchy, possibly by establishing a regency for Faruq’s son. Such a move would not be intended to restore the power of the Palace, but rather to supply a sense of continuity and legitimacy.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. Economic Situation</p>
                        <p>31. The <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> inherited a number of serious and growing economic problems which previous governments had failed to deal with effectively. The basic problem arises from the fact that the population of Egypt, now roughly 23 million, is increasing by almost two and one-half percent per year, whereas national income shows no comparable rise. Moreover, Egypt is heavily dependent on a single crop—long staple cotton accounts for 80 percent of its exports— which it has had difficulty in selling in recent years. Nevertheless, Egypt attained a balance of payments on current account in 1954. Although its gold and foreign exchange holdings are large, primarily because of the wartime accumulation of sterling, much of this is still blocked by the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. However, there are provisions for the gradual liquidation of this account. Over the past three years, the regime has succeeded in obtaining more than $50 million in economic aid from the US, including $40 million for economic development. During recent years Egypt has enjoyed a high degree of monetary stability. While this stability has been maintained under the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>, this body cannot claim credit for establishing it. The accumulation of large exchange reserves during World War II, coupled with conservative banking practices inherited from the British, largely account for the favorable financial position. It is, in fact, this monetary stability and foreign exchange reserves which make major economic projects in Egypt feasible.</p>
                        <p>32. As a matter of first priority, the regime moved quickly against corruption and inefficiency in government which had adversely affected the economy. It also took emergency measures to dispose of a large cotton carryover which had been priced out of the world market. Finally, it promised to press forward with economic development programs which had been under consideration for years, and added measures of its own. It announced a sweeping program of land redistribution and land reform, labor reforms, liberalized investment laws, a stepped-up industrialization program, and a plan to increase the amount of land in cultivation—primarily through construction of a new high dam on the Nile above Aswan.</p>
                        <p>33. On balance, the regime’s attack on economic problems is not likely to meet with great success. While the land program has won <pb xml:id="pg_759" n="759" facs="0787"/>some support for the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> among the peasantry, its political value has decreased with the passage of time, as it has become apparent that only a tiny fraction—perhaps 150,000 out of nearly three million peasant families—will obtain land of their own through redistribution of the 750,000 acres involved in the program. The rest of Egypt’s six million cultivable acres will remain in the hands of their present owners. Moreover, even if the program is quickly and efficiently implemented, rural living standards will not necessarily improve, because of the growing population. Underemployment among hired farm laborers may increase, and production may actually decrease as a result of the changes in ownership, production methods, and marketing channels. Government attempts to collect payments for the land from the new peasant proprietors will probably become a continuing cause of friction, even though payment rates have been set at half or less of the value of the land to be expropriated and are to be spaced over a 30-year period.</p>
                        <p>34. Despite some success in developing new markets for its cotton through increased sales to Israel and growing barter trade with the Sino-Soviet Bloc, Egypt faces continuing problems in the disposal of the crop. These would become especially severe if a revision of US cotton export policy in 1956 were to confront Egypt with the competition of US surplus sales. In addition, Egypt’s difficulties in selling long staple cotton to the US are increased by a rigid US import quota and by the growing competition of domestic equivalents and synthetics. In these circumstances, Egyptian trade with the Bloc, which in 1954–1955 took over 22 percent of Egypt’s total cotton exports, is likely to increase. While such trade may provide a solution to the cotton surplus, growing dependence on this outlet may make Egypt increasingly susceptible to economic pressures and inducements from the Soviet Bloc, particularly if world cotton prices continue to decline.</p>
                        <p>35. The key project in the regime’s internal development program is the construction of a new high dam on the Nile, a few miles south of the existing Aswan Dam. Over-all costs of the project, including land reclamation and hydroelectric installations, are estimated at approximately $1.3 billion, including about $400 million in foreign exchange components. Construction time for the dam is estimated at 10 years, with a total of 18 years required for completion of all the related projects. The dam should make possible the reclamation of about 1.5 million acres, making up to one-third more arable land available than at present. The hydroelectric installations would provide an important impetus to industry.</p>
                        <p>36. Financing the High Dam presents formidable obstacles, since it depends not only on foreign assistance, but also on Egypt’s willingness to concentrate its own development resources almost <pb xml:id="pg_760" n="760" facs="0788"/>exclusively on this project, and to hold government spending to an absolute minimum in other respects. Failure to exercise this sort of discipline would probably result in unsound government financing with serious inflationary consequences. The Egyptians have engaged in extensive negotiations with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (<gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>), which has concluded on the basis of engineering studies that the project is technically feasible. The Bank has been reluctant, however, to advance a loan until it was satisfied that Egypt or other sources would provide a substantial portion (about 50 percent) of the outside financing necessary. It has also been hesitant to do so until agreement was reached between Egypt and the Sudan on the Nile waters. More recently, an international consortium of British, French, and German firms has done considerable planning for the project, and if financing can be obtained either through the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> or with direct Western governmental aid, appears to be ready to proceed.</p>
                        <p>37. Agreement with the Sudan on the division of presently unallocated Nile waters will be difficult to achieve. The Sudanese are studying an Egyptian proposal, but the good offices of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and possibly of the US may be required before agreement can be reached. The principal factors influencing the Sudan’s position are its own rapid movement toward independence and the difficulties in reconciling Egyptian requirements with its own development plans and anticipated needs.</p>
                        <p>38. In the face of slow progress with the West, Egypt has received from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> an offer reported to have been of $600 million in Soviet goods and services to construct the dam. Payment for this would be in cotton and rice over a 30-year period at two percent interest. If the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> actually followed through, the Aswan High Dam would constitute an enormous monument to Soviet industry. During the course of its construction, it would serve as an important vehicle for the extension of Soviet influence. In spite of certain technical and other objections, the Nasir regime is determined to carry out the project as evidence of its efforts on behalf of the Egyptian masses. If the regime lost hope of obtaining satisfactory financing assistance from Western sources, it would probably seek an acceptable offer from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>39. Even completion of the High Dam is unlikely to raise the Egyptian standard of living significantly, since the population will probably continue to grow at a rate sufficient to absorb the added resources without increasing per capita income. The regime’s plans for increasing industrialization, including construction of a steel mill at Helwan and a fertilizer plant at Aswan, are also unlikely to have a substantial beneficial impact. Industry cannot expand in the future as rapidly as it has during the last 15 years, because of the limited <pb xml:id="pg_761" n="761" facs="0789"/>internal markets for those goods which can be economically produced in Egypt. Moreover, only a small fraction of Egyptian manufactures can meet the competition in world markets.</p>
                        <p>40. In sum, while some progress may be made in coping with Egypt’s economic problems, the population growth factor is such that present reforms and development plans, even if fully implemented, would probably succeed only in holding the low standard of living at its present level. Egypt could probably make some adjustments in its economy by diverting considerable acreage from cotton to wheat, as was done in World War II. However, at present prices of wheat and cotton, Egypt is likely to prefer the production of cotton.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">IV. Military Outlook</p>
                        <p>41. The Egyptian ground forces consist of the regular army, the Frontier Corps, and the National Guard. The regular army, with a strength of 76,000, is composed of 2 infantry division headquarters, 7 infantry brigades, 2 antiaircraft brigades, 1 airborne brigade, 3 armored groups (brigades), and 3 other units at brigade strength, together with smaller artillery, antitank, engineer signal and service units. The National Guard, with an estimated strength of 60,000 (including commandos), is loosely organized along lines paralleling the regular army, but suffers a lack of officers, noncommissioned officers, and equipment. Nevertheless, about 10,000 National Guard troops are serving on the Israeli frontier with the regular army. The Frontier Corps of 6,400 men is disposed along the frontiers in numerous small units. Prior to the Soviet Bloc arms deal, the Egyptian Air Force had 260 aircraft, including 52 jet fighters. Its personnel strength consists of 700 officers, 377 of whom are pilots, and 6,000 enlisted men and civilians. The navy has a personnel strength of 5,700, equipped with a variety of light escort, coastal patrol, and service vessels.</p>
                        <p>42. At the present time approximately 30,000 regular army and National Guard troops, primarily infantry with a small amount of artillery and tanks, are deployed in the Sinai Peninsula.</p>
                        <p>43. Throughout its tenure of power, the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> has assigned a high priority to the improvement of the armed forces. Indeed, it was the poor condition of Egypt’s forces under the old regime, and their consequent defeat in the Palestine War of 1948, which stimulated the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>’s rise to power. The regime will almost certainly continue its vigorous efforts to improve Egypt’s military establishment. Its arms deal with the Soviet Bloc has won the approval of politically conscious civilian elements who share with the regime a desire to build up Egypt’s military capabilities against Israel.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_762" n="762" facs="0790"/>
                        <p>44. The <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> has been highly successful in improving the morale of the armed forces. It has increased military pay and allowances and improved quarters for the forces. Considerable dead wood among senior military officers has been eliminated. Training and performance, primarily at the infantry battalion level, have been considerably improved, in part through the efforts of an unofficial German advisory mission. Morale in all services has also been substantially raised by the government’s success in procuring quantities of relatively modem arms and by its tougher military policy toward Israel.</p>
                        <p>45. Egypt’s actual military capabilities, however, have probably not been significantly improved as yet. The high command and staff are still markedly deficient in professional knowledge and experience. Serious problems of supply and logistics would have to be overcome before the forces could perform efficiently in combat. The political and administrative role played by top level army and air force officers has diverted their attention from military matters. It would take considerable time, effort, and money to make the Egyptian Navy, which lacks modem combat vessels and trained personnel, an effective organization.</p>
                        <p>46. Until recently, the regime’s efforts to modernize and reorganize the forces have been frustrated by its failure to procure modern weapons. Most of the weapons which have been obtained from various foreign commercial sources have been obsolete and heterogeneous. Since 1954, Egypt has obtained about 29 Centurion tanks and 30 jet fighters from the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, and other military items, including two destroyers, are on order from the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. France has agreed to resume arms shipments which were suspended as a result of Egyptian support for the North African nationalists. In 1954, Egypt declined an offer of US grant military aid on the grounds that it could not accept the legal conditions required by the US Military Defense Assistance Program. In the summer of 1955, the US approved an Egyptian request to purchase 100 medium tanks, 50 light piston bombers, and other equipment, but conclusion of the agreement was delayed because of Egypt’s difficulties in finding the dollars to pay for these items.</p>
                        <p>47. Soviet agreement to sell military equipment to Egypt was first expressed to Nasir in the spring of 1955. Nasir announced in late September that Egypt had contracted with Czechoslovakia for an unspecified amount of equipment. Nasir has maintained that the contract is a purely commercial agreement. The agreement is said to be of five years duration and to include an initial order of: 200 jet aircraft; 100 “heavy” tanks; 6 motor torpedo boats; and 2 submarines—all with necessary spare parts. An initial shipment of 37 light jet bombers and 63 MIG–15’s is reportedly to be delivered by <pb xml:id="pg_763" n="763" facs="0791"/>December 1955 and the 100 tanks are to be delivered at an unspecified early date. Some deliveries already have been made and Bloc technicians have arrived in Egypt to assemble the equipment and to instruct in maintenance and operation. The Egyptians claim that these technicians are to remain for limited periods only.</p>
                        <p>48. Assuming that the Bloc actually supplies all of these items, and that they are in good condition, in terms of military hardware alone the deal would: (a) give Egypt marked qualitative and quantitative superiority in both fighter and bomber aircraft over Israel, which is already inferior in numbers of aircraft to the Arab states as a group; (b) significantly reduce Israel’s present numerical superiority in tanks; and (c) furnish Egypt with means of harassing Israel’s shipping.<note n="3" xml:id="d411fn3">A comparison of present Egyptian and Israeli armaments strengths, excluding those scheduled for Egypt from the Soviet Bloc, appears in an appendix. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> With the assistance of Soviet Bloc technicians, the Egyptian Army could have a limited number of tanks in operation in a few weeks after delivery, and within four to five months could have about 100 in operation. However, about a year would be required before the new tanks could be integrated and effectively used in unit operations.</p>
                        <p>49. The Egyptian Air Force (EAF) presently has about 30 pilots qualified and considered combat-ready, under Middle East standards, in British types of jet aircraft. Training of these pilots in Soviet aircraft may have begun already. Improvement of EAF offensive capability against Israel would nevertheless be slow due to inefficiencies in maintenance and supply. It would probably take at least six months for this improvement in offensive capability to become significant. Egypt’s air defense capability, now considered negligible, would likewise improve with the addition of the new types of aircraft. However, the lack of radar, early warning, and a good communications system will minimize this improvement in air defense.</p>
                        <p>50. Although the motor torpedo boats could probably be used on receipt, at least a year would be required before Soviet submarines could be effectively operated by Egyptian crews.</p>
                        <p>51. The chief immediate effect of the arms deals on Egypt’s combat capabilities has been to raise morale. Until the Egyptians are ready to use the new equipment in unit operations, they will probably remain extremely vulnerable to an Israeli attack in force. If such an attack should occur under present circumstances, we estimate that Egypt could defend the Sinai area for only a very short time. Even assuming a successful withdrawal from Sinai, Egyptian forces would probably not be capable of conducting offensive operations <pb xml:id="pg_764" n="764" facs="0792"/>unless the greater part of Israeli forces were engaged on other fronts.</p>
                        <p>52. Egypt’s efforts to improve its capabilities will be hampered by deficiencies in logistics, command and staff proficiency, and intangible military qualities such as esprit de corps. Over the long run, however, several factors must be considered in evaluating Egypt’s military potential. It has a much greater population potential for expansion of the armed forces than does Israel, and in a war of attrition could absorb far more casualties. Together with its Arab allies, it commands economic resources superior to those of Israel, and is in a better geographical position to withstand blockade. If Egypt could absorb and effectively utilize extensive amounts of Soviet equipment, its present power relationship with Israel might be reversed.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">V. Future Foreign Policies and Orientation</p>
                        <p>53. The fundamental objective of Egypt’s foreign policy is to maintain freedom from foreign domination. To this end, the regime considers that it must maintain an independent position between the great power blocs. Although the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> is opposed to local Egyptian Communism, it has welcomed Soviet Bloc support as a means of counteracting Western pressures on Egypt. It sees rivalry between the Bloc and the West as presenting an opportunity both to secure economic advantages and to advance its foreign policy objectives.</p>
                        <p>54. Specific Egyptian foreign policy objectives include: (a) acquiring leadership in the Arab world; (b) strengthening Egypt’s military and political position vis-à-vis Israel; (3) establishing influence in the Sudan; and (d) a general undermining of the Western position in the Middle East and in Africa.</p>
                        <p>55. <hi rend="italic">The Sino-Soviet Bloc</hi>. The <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> almost certainly estimates that the arms agreement has substantially improved its domestic and international position. It almost certainly will not abandon this agreement in the face of Western pressures and it will continue to welcome additional Bloc support.</p>
                        <p>56. Since the signing of the Turco-Pakistani Pact, which preceded the Baghdad Pact,<note n="4" xml:id="d411fn4">Turkey, Iraq, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Pakistan, and Iran are now members of this Pact. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> Egypt has led Arab opposition to Western defense efforts, supported by Syria and Saudi Arabia—the other recipients of Soviet arms offers. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> almost certainly appreciates that US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> difficulties in creating a defense system will be seriously increased: (a) by heightening Arab-Israeli tensions; (b) by depriving the Western Powers of the advantage of being the only significant source of arms for the Arab states; and (c) by creating <pb xml:id="pg_765" n="765" facs="0793"/>invidious comparisons in Arab minds between the spectacular amount and easy terms of Soviet aid promised to Egypt, and the relative handful of materiel which Iraq has been receiving as a member of the “northern tier” group of nations.</p>
                        <p>57. In addition to undermining Western defense efforts and influence in the Middle East, present Soviet policies are probably aimed at lessening Egypt’s dependence on the West, increasing Soviet bargaining power, and fostering the idea that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> shares common objectives in the area with Egypt and its Arab allies. The Soviets probably expect that Egyptian acceptance of arms from the Bloc in exchange for cotton, together with recent agreements for substantially increased barter trade in nonmilitary items, will require continued Egyptian reliance on the Bloc, thus providing increased opportunities for subversion and political penetration.</p>
                        <p>58. In the short run, the most promising and immediate opportunities open to the Soviets lie in exploiting the strong neutralist feeling of the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> and its supporters. Nasir’s trip to the Bandung Conference in April 1955, already had strengthened this neutralism, and <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nehru</persName> may have encouraged Nasir’s opposition to US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-backed defense pacts in the Middle East. Tito’s success in developing a middle position has probably also impressed him.</p>
                        <p>59. We believe that the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> intends to avoid political alignment with the Soviet Bloc. It is unlikely that Egypt would enter into political commitments in exchange for Soviet arms or economic aid. The same apprehensive, suspicious nationalism that underlay Egypt’s rejection of alignment with the West in a Middle East defense organization will probably work with equal force against Soviet efforts to obtain a special position in Egypt. Egypt will continue to interpret any arms agreements with the Soviet Bloc as commercial transactions without political implications, and it will take the position that such transactions should not affect good relations with the West.</p>
                        <p>60. However, the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> regime almost certainly overestimates its ability to handle both the short and long-range risks of accepting the Soviet arms offer. The sheer technical problems of assembling and maintaining the materiel involved, quite aside from training Egyptian personnel to use it effectively, will place the regime under strong compulsions to admit greater numbers of Bloc technicians and training personnel for longer periods than it probably now thinks will be necessary. Having acquired the arms, Nasir will be reluctant to close Egypt’s doors to such personnel as may be needed to make them useful, particularly if the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> itself and the Bloc representatives sent to Egypt continue to avoid the appearance of having political or subversive designs. Egypt will also remain dependent on the Bloc for spare parts.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_766" n="766" facs="0794"/>
                        <p>61. To the extent that the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> is alarmed and provoked by Israeli activist border policies, the urge to seek continuing Bloc technical and military help will increase. If war should actually break out between Egypt and Israel, assuming it continued for any considerable period, the urge would probably become irresistible.</p>
                        <p>62. Initially at least, the Bloc is likely to behave with circumspection in order to soothe Egyptian fears of Soviet political and subversive intentions. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will also probably employ occasions such as Nasir’s visit to Moscow, scheduled for 1956, and Chou En-lai’s forthcoming trip to Cairo, to underscore the similarity of Bloc and Egyptian objectives in the Middle East. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> through such measures will also exploit Nasir’s desire for prestige in the international community.</p>
                        <p>63. So long as the Soviets maintain this correct attitude, the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> regime will be under strong pressure to accept continuing and even increased ties with the Bloc. The <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> appears sufficiently impressed by current Soviet “soft” tactics to believe that deals with the Bloc involve comparatively little risk. In the long run, barring a hardening of Soviet policy toward Egypt, the main factors which will determine the extent of Soviet influence in Egypt are: (a) the regime’s own estimate of its need for Western support to insure its independence; (b) the extent to which its economic, political, and military aspirations are actually satisfied by the West; and (c) the degree of Egyptian satisfaction or dissatisfaction with Soviet performance. Should Egypt feel that it had been “written off” by the West, it would be forced into increasing dependence on the Bloc.</p>
                        <p>64. If the Soviet Bloc elected to supplement material offers to Egypt by a more active campaign on behalf of the Egyptian and Arab position on political issues in the area, the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> would almost certainly welcome such support. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has already indicated that it is prepared to take a more active political part in seeing that “justice,” as Egypt conceives of it, is done in the Middle East. It has reportedly even assured Nasir that it will seek his prior approval before adopting policies on questions, such as arms aid to the Sudan, which affect Egypt’s interests. A Soviet move in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in favor of Arab demands for implementing the 1947 <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution for the partition of Palestine would evoke powerful reactions of approval within Egypt and other Arab states. It would place the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> under an obvious public political debt to the Bloc, and substantially enhance the prestige and potential of the Bloc and of Egyptian Communists. It would also place the Western Powers in an extremely difficult position, in view of their relations with Israel, and would intensify existing Arab resentment at the West’s support of Israel.</p>
                        <p>65. <hi rend="italic">Relations with the US</hi>. The strains on Egyptian relations with the US resulting from Egypt’s arms deal have come on top of a <pb xml:id="pg_767" n="767" facs="0795"/>number of other policy conflicts. The Egyptians have long regarded US support for Israel as a serious if not fatal impediment to cooperation with the US. In the past year or so, US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-backed “northern tier” defense efforts have appeared to the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> to run squarely against its interests, since these efforts involve support for Egypt’s only potent Arab rival, Iraq. Additional Egyptian resentment toward the US has resulted from the regime’s failure to obtain arms from the US on its own terms, from delay in securing US assistance for the high dam, from apprehensions that the US might undercut Egypt by subsidizing US cotton exports, from the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>’s conviction that the US has been unsympathetic to Egyptian objectives in the Sudan, and from the US position on the French North African question.</p>
                        <p>66. We believe that the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> will continue to want friendly relations with the US, and its acceptance of Bloc support may even enhance the value it sets on Western assistance, both for its own value and as a counterweight. The Egyptians in any event will probably make use of Soviet offers in an effort to gain concessions from the US. At the same time, Nasir and his associates, strengthened in their belief that Soviet support has increased their bargaining power, will be more inclined than ever to resist concessions to the West which appear to them inconsistent with their goal of independence and pursuit of their objectives in the area.</p>
                        <p>67. <hi rend="italic">Relations with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and France</hi>. Egyptian hatred for British “imperialism” remains strong and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, along with the US, continues to incur Egyptian resentment over Western defense policies and support for Iraq and Israel. At the same time, Egypt continues to have important economic and military ties with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. Egyptian leaders not only retain a certain respect for <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> advice, but also recognize that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> continues to exercise influence in Jordan and, to a lesser extent, in Iraq, the Sudan, and Libya. Thus in certain matters the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> may be in a better position than the US to influence Egyptian policy. For the most part, however, the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>’s relations with the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> are not likely to differ significantly.</p>
                        <p>68. Egypt and France share a certain interest in preventing the extension of Iraqi influence in the Levant. Nevertheless, relations have been strained by Egypt’s opposition to the French position in North Africa and by Egyptian resentment of French sales of jet fighters and other arms to Israel. Although Egypt may tone down its support of the nationalist cause in French North Africa as a result of a French agreement to resume the sale of arms to Egypt, it is unlikely to abandon this support.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_768" n="768" facs="0796"/>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Policies Toward Middle East Questions</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>69. <hi rend="italic">Israel</hi>. Recent Bloc support for the Arab side against Israel has diminished the chances that the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> would move toward an accommodation with Israel. Indeed the arms deal has substantially increased the likelihood of an Egyptian-Israeli war. Israel may feel compelled to take preventive action. Egypt will probably respond more vigorously to Israeli border actions and, as its strength increases, may become more disposed to launch a “second round” against Israel. The regime is also likely to continue its intransigence with respect to Israel’s demands for passage through the Suez Canal and the Gulf of Aqaba.</p>
                        <p>70. Barring a war, there is some chance that Egypt’s growing military strength, by giving the Nasir regime self-confidence, would lead it to continue to put out feelers for an Israeli-Egyptian settlement—but only on Egypt’s own terms. Nasir has suggested that if Israel would concede a defensible area in the Negev linking Egypt and Jordan and compensate the refugees, Egypt might be ready to negotiate some form of settlement. For the foreseeable future, however, there is little likelihood that Israel would accept a proposal involving any such alienation of its territory. Egyptian willingness to liquidate the Israel problem by some such form of settlement might be increased if the regime became preoccupied with problems relatively remote from the Arab-Israel area, notably its relations with the Sudan.</p>
                        <p>71. <hi rend="italic">Other Arab States</hi>. In most of the Arab world, Egypt’s arms deal with the Soviet Bloc was hailed as a bold assertion of independence from Western tutelage, and as a highly effective move toward overcoming Israel’s military superiority. Among the Arab states the regime’s prestige is now higher than ever, having largely recovered from the blow suffered early in 1955 when Iraq signed the Baghdad Pact and the Egyptian-Saudi-Syrian Pact failed. The <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> is accordingly likely to pursue its objectives in the Arab world with increased vigor and greater hopes of success.</p>
                        <p>72. Foremost among these objectives is Egyptian leadership of the other Arab states. In this effort, the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> finds itself seriously challenged only by Iraq. The latter’s defense ties with the West violate Egypt’s concept of a purely Arab defense arrangement, and combined with Iraq’s recent maneuvers in Syria, raise the spectre of Iraqi domination of the northern Arab states. Such a development would be particularly repugnant to Egypt (and Saudi Arabia) since, the regime fears, it would leave Egypt isolated, and mean the continuation of US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> special positions among the Arab states. The main arena of Egypt’s rivalry with Iraq continues to be the strategically located but weak and divided state of Syria. Egypt <pb xml:id="pg_769" n="769" facs="0797"/>scored a success in October 1955 when it concluded a defense pact with Syria, providing for unified command, a joint military fund, and immediate mutual assistance in case of an Israeli attack.</p>
                        <p>73. Egypt is likely to attempt, on the one hand, to strengthen the Arab League, or a similar association, and concurrently to encourage bilateral military arrangements between Egypt and other Arab states (Iraq excepted). With Syria uppermost in mind, Egypt will almost certainly oppose amalgamation of any Arab states. It will almost certainly continue vigorous efforts to counteract Iraqi moves in Syria, and will accept financial support from Saudi Arabia to this end. It is unlikely that the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> could be reconciled to Iraqi domination of Syria even if it recognized that the alternative might be Soviet penetration and ultimately Communist domination.</p>
                        <p>74. Should Egypt be confronted with an actual Iraqi take-over in Syria, its reaction would be extremely hostile and emotional. The Nasir regime would feel compelled to honor its alliance with Syria, although it could do little militarily. At a minimum it would probably step up its anti-Iraq campaign in Syria and other Arab states, with the vigorous help of Saudi Arabia. The <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> might even commit aircraft against Iraqi forces if the latter entered Syria.</p>
                        <p>75. <hi rend="italic">The Sudan</hi>. The <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> is disturbed by the apparent failure of its Sudanese policies to produce a pro-Egyptian provisional government in the Sudan. It has reluctantly accepted the probability that when the present transitional period ends in 1956, the Sudanese will choose independence rather than some form of union with Egypt. Egypt fears that this development would jeopardize the prospects for agreement on the Nile waters. In addition, Egypt fears that an independent Sudanese government would be weak and unstable, and could not be relied on to uphold agreements on water use. Finally, an independent Sudan would end the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>’s hopes of exploiting Sudanese land resources to help solve Egypt’s pressing population problems.</p>
                        <p>76. It appears unlikely that Egypt can prevent a Sudanese decision in favor of independence. However, it will probably continue its efforts to discredit pro-independence elements in the Sudan, to strengthen pro-union groups, and to foster conflict between the southern and northern areas of the Sudan. Should either the transitional Sudanese government or its successor reject Egyptian offers for a water agreement without leaving the door open for further negotiations, a serious crisis in Egyptian-Sudanese relations would almost certainly develop, possibly leading to the use of force by the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> and thus to direct conflict with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. In the meantime, Egypt is likely to encourage the Sudan to pursue an “independent” and “neutral” policy toward the great powers, which might mean closer Sudanese ties with the Soviet Bloc.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_770" n="770" facs="0798"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">VI. Probable Consequences of Possible US Courses of Action</p>
                        <p>77. While the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> wishes to retain US support, it believes that Egypt’s overriding interests justify actions such as the arms deal with the Soviet Bloc or opposition to the “northern tier” alliance. It also believes that the US should maintain a tolerant attitude toward such actions.</p>
                        <p>78. If the US reaction to the Soviet arms deal is relatively mild and involves no modification of former policies toward Egypt, the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>’s initial response probably will be one of relief. So far, the absence of any marked US policy reaction has resulted in <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> uneasiness as to the form US policy toward Egypt might eventually take. This uneasiness could lead to increased suspicion of the US and consequently to further restriction of US activities in Egypt.</p>
                        <p>79. A US or <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> decision to assist Egypt in constructing the High Aswan Dam would be welcomed as a strong indication of continued US support. At the same time, the regime would conclude that such a decision was in direct response to the arms deal and to Soviet economic assistance offers, and that it could continue to obtain benefits by playing the West and the Bloc off against each other.</p>
                        <p>80. Although a US withdrawal of economic and technical aid already programmed would have little effect on the Egyptian economy, such a move would probably produce an angry and emotional reaction from the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>. It would almost certainly lead Nasir to conclude that the US was attempting to isolate Egypt and bring about the downfall of the regime. The danger of violent anti-US disorders would be great. The <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> would probably rely increasingly on Soviet economic and technical support. These dangers would be greatly increased if in addition to withdrawing existing aid, the US should make other moves, such as the dumping of surplus US cotton. Such a policy or even the public threat of it would almost certainly have a highly unsettling effect on Egypt’s economy.</p>
                        <p>81. A US decision to discontinue aid after the end of the current year’s program would have only a limited effect on Egypt’s economy. Adverse reaction in Egypt would not be as great as if existing programs were abruptly terminated. Such action, however, would be regarded by the regime as evidence of US opposition, or at least indifference, to the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>’s continued control of Egypt.</p>
                        <p>82. The Egyptian reaction to US moves to reassure Israel would depend on the extent to which such moves appeared to apply to both sides and to be designed to preserve the status quo. A reaffirmation of the Tripartite Declaration of 1950 would probably produce only a slight reaction in Egypt and the other Arab states. A convincing demonstration of US determination to intervene effectively in <pb xml:id="pg_771" n="771" facs="0799"/>the event of aggression would probably reassure and restrain both sides, although Egypt and the other Arab states would regard it primarily as a guarantee of Israel’s security. If the US provided Israel with any amount of arms, even if labeled as being primarily defensive, or particularly if it extended to Israel alone a guarantee of its presently-held territory, US relations with Egypt and the other Arab states would be severely strained. Such a US security guarantee, if accompanied by extensive shipments of arms, not only might lead Egypt to break off relations with the US, and even to accept a Soviet guarantee if offered, but also would endanger the position of the Western Powers throughout the Middle East.</p>

                        <p>10. For Ambassador from Secretary. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> told me yesterday <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> is concerned over impression in Tel Aviv that US Government does not fully support his Guildhall speech which <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Ambassador has assured Israeli Government had Secretary’s “full agreement”. He asks at minimum that <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> be told by you that US supports <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> in this matter.</p>
                        <p>For your information:</p>
                        <p>While not desiring to disassociate myself from <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> initiative which on whole I consider constructive, you should know that I did not approve <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> speech in advance. In fact I was only shown by <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> single paragraph from speech at noon on day of its delivery and I raised question about point it discussed reference to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution of 1947.<note n="2" xml:id="d412fn2">See <ref target="#d391">Document 391</ref>.</note>

                        <p>Unless Department instructs you to contrary I suggest you might however let <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> know in general terms that US and <pb xml:id="pg_773" n="773" facs="0801"/>

                        <p>For <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName>. I understand British Embassy, Washington has copy <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> cable from Tel Aviv on which <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s concern based.<note n="3" xml:id="d412fn3">Patrick Hancock of the British Delegation in Geneva gave <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> a copy of the telegram from Tel Aviv under cover of a memorandum dated November 15. The telegram reported that Israeli press comment on <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s speech was “increasingly uncompromising and unfriendly”; that “the Israel Government believes that the U.S. Government are not fully behind it”; and that the United States could best correct this misconception by issuing a public statement of support. (Department of State, Central Files, 396.1–GE/11–1555)</note> I incline strongly against public statement which cable suggests unless you were consulted more fully than I was and in timely advance of <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> speech.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said he had called in pursuance of a conversation between Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> and Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> in Geneva regarding arms.<note n="2" xml:id="d413fn2">Reported in <ref target="#d371">Document 371</ref>.</note> He emphasized that the Israeli Government had had no intention whatever of expending its resources for any considerable arms purchases until a few months ago, when the <hi rend="italic">massive</hi> imbalance being created by the Czech-Egyptian arms deal became known. He said the Israeli request for arms sprang <hi rend="italic">directly</hi>
                            <pb xml:id="pg_774" n="774" facs="0802"/>from that imbalance. He was fearful that other Arab states might also obtain large quantities of arms from the Soviet bloc and cited the continued threats and hostile acts against Israel by its Arab neighbors as the basis for the dire apprehensions of the Israeli people.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said that Israel, like the United States, wanted to be strong militarily in order to <hi rend="italic">prevent</hi> aggression.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador explained that Israel came to the United States because the 1950 Tripartite Declaration led his Government to believe that it could expect United States help. (His succeeding formal presentation followed almost verbally the attached note to the Secretary of State.<note n="3" xml:id="d413fn3">The note, not attached to the source text, requested approval for Israel’s purchase of arms and equipment, listed on an attachment. It declared that Israel’s decision to expand its military procurement program was due to the “massive influx of Soviet arms into Egypt” under the Czech-Egyptian agreement which would enable Egypt to threaten Israel’s population centers and to extend belligerent practices into the Mediterranean. It argued that in the past, the United States had opposed creation of an arms imbalance which could be used for intimidation or aggression, and it declared that Israel’s proposed arms purchase program was intended “to strengthen Israel’s capacity of legitimate self-defense to the minimal extent compatible with her security.” (Department of State, Central Files, 784A.5–<gloss target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss>/11–1655)</note>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> expressed appreciation for this clarification of the principles which would govern the United States in its examination of his Government’s request, which, he felt, was fully in accord with President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s statement opposing an arms race and stating that arms would be accorded for self-defense. He emphasized that the Israeli request for arms was <hi rend="italic">solely</hi> for defensive purposes. He asked that the Israeli list of arms be kept strictly confidential, for security reasons. As regards General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName>’ proposals, he said the General was already fully aware of his Government’s approval. The only reason General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> had not been authorized to inform the <pb xml:id="pg_775" n="775" facs="0803"/>Egyptian Government of this approval was a technical one, i.e., the Egyptians would have refused if they felt Israel had already agreed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> asked whether the Israeli Government would agree to a demarcation of the entire El Auja demilitarized zone, pointing out that if United Nations observers are to certify the absence of military installations and personnel in the zone, they would need to know the precise boundaries of the zone on all sides. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said he would not wish to go beyond the <persName>Burns</persName> proposals<note n="6" xml:id="d413fn6">See <ref target="#d376">Documents 376</ref> and <ref target="#d382">382</ref>.</note> at this time since, if additional proposals were added, his Government might wish to ask, for example, that the area in Sinai beyond which Egypt is forbidden by the armistice to maintain troops and installations should also be demarcated.</p>
                        <p>Referring to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName>’s references to a general settlement of the Arab-Israeli problem, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> spoke in strong opposition to the recent Mansion House speech of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>. He said that references had often been made for the necessity for secret diplomacy when matters such as frontiers were to be discussed. Consequently, he had been shocked by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s proposals regarding frontiers made from the most public platform possible. Even more important, Israeli objections were to the substance of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s reference to the United Nations resolutions. Speaking frankly, he did not think the United Kingdom could qualify in any way as a mediator in this question, since the United Kingdom had tried to prevent the creation of Israel from the start and today has numerous and intimate treaty relations with the Arab states. He thought it remarkable that the United Kingdom would now invoke the 1947 resolution when, at the time it was passed, the United Kingdom denounced it bitterly and refused even to permit the United Nations commission to enter Palestine. He said the United States and France were in quite a different position since “you don’t sign up with any Arab state that comes along while leaving Israel out.” He said his Government would be ready at any time any Arab state asked for boundary discussions under the armistice. He spoke in highest terms of the Secretary’s speech of August 26 on the grounds that it did not prejudge the territorial settlement. He felt that the most urgent matter referred to in the Secretary’s speech was the question of compensation for refugees. His Government was ready and anxious to begin discussions on this question promptly.</p>
                        <p>In answer to a question by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>, Colonel Salmon stated that Israel had no substantial arms purchasing programs in other countries. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> referred to press reports that Israel was obtaining Mystére fighter planes from France and said that not one single <pb xml:id="pg_776" n="776" facs="0804"/>Mystére had been obtained. He did not know what possibility there might be for obtaining Mystéres.</p>
                        <p>As regards financing, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> referred again to the statement in the note that Israel hoped we would extend the lowest possible prices and most liberal credit terms in view of his Government’s difficult economic and financial situation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> pointed out that the question of financing was a complicated legal one requiring serious examination. In answer to a question, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> and Colonel Salmon stated that the Israeli request was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> contingent upon special financial arrangements being accorded by the United States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SR1">Shiloah</persName> said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> had pointed out to Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> in Geneva that Israel did not know how to fight submarines and would welcome consultations with appropriate United States authorities on this subject. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> remarked that anti-submarine weapons are often under highest security classification.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> terminated the conversation with renewed emphasis on the solemnity and importance of his call on the Acting Secretary, on a subject which his Government regarded as a significant landmark in United States-Israeli relations.</p>

                        <p>2029. Geneva for Secretary. I am puzzled and confused as to our government’s attitude toward <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s Guildhall speech on Arab-Israel situation. I have had no reply to my telegram 1959<note n="2" xml:id="d414fn2">

With regard to <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 317 from Geneva,<note n="3" xml:id="d414fn3">Printed as <ref target="#d412">Document 412</ref>.</note> I can only say that rightly or wrongly British have definite impression <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s speech although not its exact phraseology had Secretary’s approval. As stated in our telegram 1926,<note n="4" xml:id="d414fn4">Not printed. (Department of State, Central Files, 684A.86/11–955)</note> we were told by Foreign Office on November 9 that “Secretary has been informed in Geneva of Prime Minister’s intention make such statement and has agreed.”</p>

In this connection, I feel Department may wish remember that last August when Secretary made his speech on subject, <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> came out within 24 hours with a statement publicly supporting Secretary’s position, also that in his remarks in House of Commons yesterday (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 2005<note n="6" xml:id="d414fn6">Not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 684A.86/11–1555)</note>), <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> referred no less than three separate times to fact that British and American Governments were working together for settlement of Arab-Israeli dispute.</p>
                        <p>In light of foregoing, I hope it will be possible for Department to advise me precisely in near future what I should say to <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> in reply to his approach to my November 11.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> explained that the purpose of this opening discussion between United States, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> officials was exploratory, without definite commitments on either side. Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger</persName> agreed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> then explained to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> that the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Governments supported the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> entirely in this matter and asked what the Bank considered to be the chief problems involved.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> said the chief question was whether Egypt would obtain adequate foreign exchange and provide enough local currency for the project. The Bank wanted to know whether Egypt was sufficiently serious in this matter to cut down on other projects and tighten its belt for the next ten years. He said the Egyptians have been naive in thinking that a project of this magnitude was easy, and were suspicious that the Bank was dictated to by the United States and United Kingdom. He pointed out that this was the biggest single undertaking the Bank had ever gone into. The Bank felt that $200 million was the most it could lend since this was the maximum amount of loans Egypt could service under present circumstances. Consequently <hi rend="italic">any</hi> other loans that Egypt incurred for any purpose would reduce the amount of the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> loan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> asked whether the Bank felt it had to undertake the whole job at one time or could the task be carried out successfully by starting on a part of it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> said all the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> studies up to the present had indicated that anyone who undertook the project should be prepared to go through with the whole job. Mr. Garner said the hydro-electric and power installations might conceivably be delayed and that the work could be spread out over 25 years but that both of these alternatives were highly undesirable.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName> asked whether Egypt would derive any income from the project before it was completed. Mr. Garner said that a nominal amount of additional irrigation might be possible after the coffer dam was completed. In response to a question, he said we must expect that Egyptian cotton production will be increased by this project.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_779" n="779" facs="0807"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> asked about the dangers of inflation in Egypt as a result of the undertaking. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> said the dangers were sizeable and that stern management by the Egyptian Government would be required. He pointed out that although the Bank would not advance the entire $200 million at once, it would have to put aside the money, charging Egypt three-fourths of one percent interest on the money being held. He said this would be the longest “standby” operation the Bank had yet undertaken. In answer to a question, he said the Bank would continually review Egypt’s credit worthiness. He was aware that the Egyptian Minister of Finance, Mr. Kaissouni, thought the Bank was too pessimistic regarding Egypt’s ability to repay foreign loans.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Flett asked whether the hydro-electric development was necessary to make the project financially feasible. Mr. Garner was doubtful that the project could be justified without the income to be produced by the production of electricity, estimated at 700,000 <gloss target="#t_kw1">kw</gloss>. originally, to be doubled subsequently.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> asked how the Bank contemplated the additional $200 million in foreign exchange and $900 million in local currency would be raised. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> said the additional foreign exchange would probably have to come from grants. The local currency would be raised by taxes and internal borrowings. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName> thought that in order to avoid serious inflation in Egypt, which would increase the cost of construction greatly, Egypt would need a large amount of foreign aid in the form of commodities.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> expressed doubt that an actual local contract could be signed between the Bank and the Egyptian Government in less than two years, because of the many preliminary studies and negotiations required. He pointed out that the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> had already given the Egyptian Government a letter of intent, several months ago, indicating that <hi rend="italic">if</hi> Egypt would do certain things, the Bank would be able to undertake the project. He said the <hi rend="italic">if</hi> was a very large one, as he had explained to Mr. Kaissouni last month in Istanbul and would explain to him again in Washington on November 21.<note n="2" xml:id="d415fn2">No record of this conversation has been found in Department of State files, but see <ref target="#d423">Document 423</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger</persName> asked what the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> would require in the way of assurances regarding additional foreign exchange on a grant basis. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> said that if the Bank had assurances by the United States and United Kingdom Governments that they would continue to support this project and back the Bank, he did not think a definite commitment stated in figures would be required. Mr. Garner pointed out that Egypt would not need substantial foreign exchange for two <pb xml:id="pg_780" n="780" facs="0808"/>or three years and that five years would be required for the construction of the diversion tunnels and the coffer dam.</p>
                        <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger</persName> asked specifically what the Bank wanted from the Egyptian Government before the Bank could give Egypt a go-ahead to start the preliminary work on the project. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> recalled that perhaps the biggest if in the letter of intent concerned a water agreement with the Sudan. Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger</persName> thought that four or five months would be required to settle that matter. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> said that division of the water was not the only problem, since thirty thousand farms and homes in the Sudan would be flooded by the lake. At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> distributed draft copies of a memorandum of what he proposed to say to Mr. Kaissouni on November 21.<note n="3" xml:id="d415fn3">No copy of this memorandum has been found in Department of State files.</note> Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger</persName> expressed the thought that the opening paragraph seemed somewhat peremptory in its emphasis on what assurances the Bank must have from Egypt. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> said the language could be made more “diplomatic” as long as the Bank’s requirements were made clear. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWR1">Burgess</persName> said the memorandum made sense to him. Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger</persName> suggested that the Bank take the lead in calling a meeting of United States, United Kingdom and <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> economists to consider the matter prior to Mr. Kaissouni’s arrival. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName> would represent the State Department; Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWR1">Burgess</persName> said Mr. Overby would represent Treasury, and Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger</persName> said that Mr. Flett would represent the United Kingdom. It was agreed that the meeting would be held on November 17.<note n="4" xml:id="d415fn4">No account of this meeting has been found in Department of State files.</note>

He outlined his views without prompting and was obviously speaking with authority <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>. In summary his position as follows:</p>
                        <p>Tactics. Egypt prepared to work towards settlement Arab-Israeli issues at earliest practical date. <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> welcomes good offices of U.S. and U.K. toward that end. Initial moves should be highly secret and through diplomatic channels but use of Trieste approach or even direct contact not ruled out in later stages. If matters could be moved to where Egypt believed there was “51 percent chance” of success, Egypt would at that time take lead with other Arab States even at risk severe opposition. Until this stage reached other Arab States should not be brought into picture. First step to guide further discussions should be for U.S. and U.K. attempt secure agreement of both sides on principles of approaches to major issues. On this basis <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> believed we should by now have Egypt’s views clearly enough in mind to approach Israel. This approach should not be on basis that Egypt had specifically agreed to certain things, but that in view of conversations here we felt that Egypt might be willing to consider settlement along lines certain principles.</p>
                        <p>Substance. Egypt’s position on “major issues” may be summarized as follows:</p>
                        <p>(a) Jerusalem—Egypt will accept any solution that is acceptable to world community. If internationalization is so acceptable and practical this would be welcomed by Egypt. If this not possible and acceptance of split city and adequate system of protection of holy <pb xml:id="pg_782" n="782" facs="0810"/>places along lines of Swedish resolution were acceptable to world community, then this too would be all right with Egypt. In other words Egypt willing approach discussions on Jerusalem with completely open mind.</p>
                        <p>(b) Refugees—Egypt believes there should be repatriation to extent practicable although realizes this quite restricted. For remainder of refugees, resettlement and compensation only answer. Compensation to be based upon actual loss of physical property only. Egypt accepts fact that resources beyond those of Israel would be necessary and would not object to principle that others help Israel pay what is really her own debt to society.</p>
                        <p>(c) Territorial—Egypt recognizes concessions from traditionally previously held positions must be made by both sides. Only principle that need be recognized as far as she concerned was that actual continuity of Arab sovereign territory should be reestablished. By this <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> did not mean a corridor. Size of territory to be transferred need not be defined at this stage during which only agreement upon principle should be sought. (There was considerable discussion regarding peacetime use of Eilath. <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> made clear if we pressed him on this point at this particular time his answer would be an emphatic “no”. However he saw no hope of forcing decision at this early date. We gained impression that ultimate concession may be possible on this point but in any case would not be obtained easily and certainly not early in talks.)</p>
                        <p>(d) Blockade—provided other things could be worked out Egypt realized this would mean complete freedom of transit of Suez. It would also mean end of Arab blockade as far as third countries were concerned. Extent of Arab desire reestablish trade and other ties with Israel would be matter for their own sovereign determination and would not form part of any settlement agreements. In other words Government of Egypt realized that type of settlement she envisaged would end state of belligerency and legislative and legal positions based upon it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: <persName corresp="#p_TSH1">Trevelyan</persName> and I believe this to be positive approach and we strongly recommend our governments now approach Israel upon basis outlined. <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName>’s presentation is certainly more than we have obtained from Government of Egypt on serious basis heretofore and much more than could be envisaged as coming from any other Arab State. <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> did not once mention 1947 partition boundaries. His position, as reported many times before, seems fairly close to Alpha plan with exception of Negev, which he clearly envisages to be last great obstacle to settlement. He was careful last night avoid using term “whole of Negev” and we believe he feels that by starting with matter of principle, gap could be eventually narrowed between present positions on both sides to point where outside forces could perhaps obtain solution upon some middle ground that both sides might “reluctantly” accept.</p>

                        <p>We were at roughly this stage before (although <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> now more definite and forthcoming and speaking with greater authority) when I urged approach to Israel in <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 461, September 14.<note n="2" xml:id="d416fn2">
                                <ref target="#d274">Document 274</ref>.</note> Department’s cables however sought some further “concrete evidence” that Egypt desired settlement. I gather from discussions in Paris and Geneva that what was meant at minimum of this phrase was Egyptian willingness to appoint representative to join in settlement discussions either with Israelis or some third party at some specified place. Do hope (and <persName corresp="#p_TSH1">Trevelyan</persName> concurs) that this position will not be maintained since it is clear that Government of Egypt will not agree to start out in this fashion. In addition obvious political difficulties, there are in fact many practical considerations including communications, selection of representatives et cetera that would cause them to refuse. Such a course could not be kept secret and neither Government of Egypt nor, we assume, ourselves would be willing to see matter become public or other Arab States informed until Government of Egypt can see some possibility of success. Furthermore <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> obviously wishes to keep <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> out of matter as well until this stage reached.</p>
                        <p>Repeat British Ambassador and I strongly urge early approach to Israel as next step in discussions. We can continue exploring here as opportunities permit but this should not delay approach to Israel. After such approach we can more clearly work out subsequent tactics.<note n="3" xml:id="d416fn3">On November 19, <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> sent <persName>Dulles</persName> a message in which <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> recommended, on the basis of this dinner conversation with <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName>, that American and British representatives “explore the ground with the Israelis.

                        <p>515. At Prime Minister’s request I called at his apartment in Jerusalem yesterday afternoon. Obviously <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> concerned over <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> speech and arms supplies to Egypt. In our long conversation he discussed emphatically and seriously current security position Israel which he said greatly worried him especially in light of recent developments. He said threat to Israel security becomes more dangerous every day; <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> has boasted he will wipe out Israel in six months; and <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s speech greatly strengthened Egypt’s intransigence.</p>
                        <p>He said <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> selling Egypt 64 Centurion tanks of which 38 delivered but <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> fails to deliver to Israel equipment it agreed to sell her. Thus <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> has violated spirit of tripartite declaration. France also selling arms to Egypt; British and French arms plus Soviet arms giving Egypt superiority over Israel.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> said that if <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> were not able to purchase certain arms from US because they were too expensive then US should not prevent France and Italy from selling arms to Israel. When I denied we had taken such action he replied “may be not France but we know definitely Italy is being prevented from selling to us.” I again expressed doubt regarding authenticity of his information and subsequent to meeting I informed one of his assistants that I believed report on this subject from the [garble] Rome had been misunderstood. In response to request of Israel Embassy Rome for meeting to discuss arms procurement with Israel Deputy Minister of Defense<note n="2" xml:id="d417fn2">Presumably Shimon Peres, who was Director General of the Ministry of Defense.</note> American Embassy Rome, not in position advise re Italian arms supply to Israel, had suggested such discussion might more properly take place in Washington or Tel Aviv (Rome’s 1686 to Department<note n="3" xml:id="d417fn3">Not printed. (Department of State, Central Files, 784A.56/11–1455)</note>); there was no attempt prevent shipment as <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> alleged.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> repeated he was very worried as to what would happen to Israel if she sat idly by while arms poured into Egypt and Israel got virtually nothing and in somewhat restrained manner commented “Israel cannot wait quietly to be struck down. Consciously or unconsciously <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> is giving Egypt possibility of striking down Israel”.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_785" n="785" facs="0813"/>
                        <p>I said effectiveness of <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and French arms supply to Egypt seemed to depend on relative quantities involved and whether it would be continuing operation or merely covered orders already placed or in pipeline. <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> thought any arms added to those <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> receiving from Soviets increase materially threat to Israel’s security and he opposed such policy.</p>
                        <p>Subject of <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s speech was very much on his mind. He was considerably exercised by British Ambassadors statement to Foreign Ministry that speech had been fully agreed to by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>. Although he felt certain British Ambassador had not made deliberate misstatement <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> could not reconcile this statement with what he considered basic differences in <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s speech and President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s statement also of November 9 nor could he visualize Secretary approving speech containing such contradictions with President’s statement. He then made following comparison: <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s speech denied (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>) British arms to Israel whereas President agreed to consider arms sales to Israel; made no reference to tripartite declaration whereas President did; did not speak against area arms race but President spoke against arms race.</p>
                        <p>He attacked <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s mention of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution 1947 along lines his Knesset speech November 15 (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 508<note n="4" xml:id="d417fn4">See <ref target="#d406fn5">footnote 5, Document 406</ref>.</note>) underscoring particularly fact that resolution never contemplated sovereignty for any existing Arab state over any land now held by Israel or over area since taken by Jordan or Gaza now held by Egypt.</p>
                        <p>In reply my question how he interpreted <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> speech he said “it is an attempt to eliminate Israel—not by people of Great Britain but by present government which considers Israel nuisance and feels it could make deal with Arab states if Israel no longer exists.” Re concession of land by Israel, he said, “I do not believe that people of Great Britain would permit their government to send troops to fight against Israel.” He then referred to an interview he gave to British correspondent some months ago in which he said if <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> wanted Israel to make concessions of its sovereign area then she must send troops to enforce that wish, in which event Israel would fight. That attitude re <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s proposal of territorial concessions held good today, he said. He thought <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s suggestion was move to isolate Israel in area as well as within western world.</p>
                        <p>I was unable to extract from <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> his own estimate of time before Egypt would be in position to employ incoming Soviet arms. But he implied that danger was closer than once believed and spoke of daily increase in danger. My impression was Israel would be able more accurately to assess imminence of danger in two or three months. I spoke of Egypt’s need for trained pilots to fly MIGs. <pb xml:id="pg_786" n="786" facs="0814"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> said Communist pilots would be supplied with planes. I replied that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> claimed to have sent his own men to Czechoslovakia for training but <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> said there would also be Czechoslovakian pilots and those to come over Israel would probably be Czechs—and every technician would be Communist agent.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> then discussed at some length design of Soviets to penetrate not only the Near East but entire African continent pointing to Egypt as ideal starting point. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>, he thought, was ideal instrument or agent who although probably legally anti-Communist would soon be unwitting tool of <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> wondered if <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> was alive to this danger. I replied that I was certain that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> understood <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> and that he was thoroughly aware of critical dangers of Soviet penetration and ambitions. Nor did I feel that he has been misled by the “Geneva smiles” as <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> thought possible. He expressed hope that I was right.</p>
                        <p>Although <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> appeared to be not well man he showed considerable vigor and his voice was strong. He was using cane in connection with his attack of lumbago but he escorted me down hall to entrance to his apartment with surprising freedom of action. His color was as high as usual but not usual healthy pink. He spoke with his usual emphasis but showed more emotion than I have ever noted in past and revealed, I thought, greater seriousness of attitude toward situation and reflected more obviously heavy weight of his responsibilities as Prime Minister. <persName corresp="#p_HCC1">Herzog</persName>, of American section, Foreign Office who was present thought <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> showed more signs of worry and responsibility than he had seen since 1948 war days.</p>

                        <p>1. A committee of Ambassadors should be formed composed of the British, French and Italian Ambassadors and a representative of the Department. The committee should first consider the question of approval of the draft “Agreed Minute” of the Tripartite meeting at Geneva. Subsequently, it should consider broad policy questions; the policy to be followed regarding representations to other friendly governments; basic procedural matters; and any contracts and shipments or other problems on which there is disagreement at the <gloss target="#t_NEACC1">NEACC</gloss> level. The Committee would meet at the request of any member.</p>
                        <p>2. The present <gloss target="#t_NEACC1">NEACC</gloss>, expanded to include Italy and with the present level representation, should be continued. <gloss target="#t_NEACC1">NEACC</gloss> will be charged with the following responsibilities: a) maintenance of records on all shipments and all proposed shipments by members or by other countries including the Soviet bloc; b) preparation of current studies on the relative armament strengths and capabilities of Israel and bordering Arab states; c) preparation of an agreed list of light equipment which could be shipped without consultation and submission of the list for approval to the committee of Ambassadors; d) consideration in the first instance of proposed contracts or shipments by the participating countries; e) immediate examination of all existing contracts not previously approved by <gloss target="#t_NEACC1">NEACC</gloss>; f) submission of recommendations to the committee of Ambassadors regarding representations to friendly governments about the supply of arms. The procedural and secretarial arrangements of the present <gloss target="#t_NEACC1">NEACC</gloss> should be continued with the addition of Italy.</p>
                        <p>3. It should be agreed by the ambassadors that the existence of the Committee and its work should be kept secret.</p>

                        <p>527. <persName corresp="#p_HCC1">Herzog</persName>, Chief American Section Foreign Ministry, yesterday referred to <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>’s November 15 conversation with Ambassador (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 515<note n="2" xml:id="d419fn2">
                                <ref target="#d417">Document 417</ref>.</note>) and inquired whether Embassy had received information confirming or denying <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>’s message that Secretary was in full agreement <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s statement. In replying I avoided any direct answer but made the following points:</p>
                        <p>(1) US area policy had been set forth publicly in Secretary’s August 26 address and President’s statement November 9.</p>
                        <p>(2) The Secretary in his talk with <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> at Paris<note n="3" xml:id="d419fn3">See <ref target="#d359">Document 359</ref>.</note> had emphasized need for Israel to give urgent consideration to sacrifices it would be willing to make to obtain settlement.</p>
                        <p>(3) The <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> endorses <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s speech insofar as it supports the Secretary’s August 26 address.</p>
                        <p>In reply, <persName corresp="#p_HCC1">Herzog</persName> in a tone of unwonted bitterness said that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> appeared to be getting everything he wanted. He was getting his arms from the Soviet Union, the High Aswan Dam from the US and now <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> had come along and offered him slices of Israel’s territory. I commented it was not clear at this moment as to how any of these 3 matters were developing but suggested that perhaps Israel was too prone to look to the US to solve all of its problems and that the time had arrived for <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to do some hard practical thinking re bringing about an Israel-Arab settlement. It appeared to me that if there was going to be a settlement an accommodation by both sides was required.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary referred to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName>’s report of the meeting on November 16 with the Egyptian Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> at Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TSH1">Trevelyan</persName>’s residence<note n="2" xml:id="d420fn2">See <ref target="#d416">Document 416</ref>.</note> and said we had asked <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> to give us any information which he might develop as to whether <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> had been speaking with the authorization of Nasir. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_TSH1">Trevelyan</persName> had reported his belief that <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> had reflected Nasir’s views. He said that he would give the Department any further information they received on it.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he would be seeing Israel Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> the following morning (November 21).<note n="3" xml:id="d420fn3">See <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>.</note> He said that <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> was in this country for two or three weeks and was obviously doing more than merely selling bonds. He was attempting to go over the head of the U.S. Government in an effort to build up pressure here for Israel’s demands for arms and a security guarantee. The Secretary said that the Israel Embassy had suggested to the Department somewhat belatedly that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> would like to make a courtesy call on the Secretary Monday<note n="4" xml:id="d420fn4">November 21.</note> morning. The Secretary said that he intended to make the meeting somewhat more than that. He intended to say to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>: (1) that the Israel Government must accept the proposals of the Secretary’s August 26th speech more unequivocally than it has; (2) with respect to territory, it must do more than make a few minor mutual adjustments, it must relinquish a section of the Negev to the Arabs to make possible a land connection between Egypt and the rest of the Arab world; and, (3) the Israel Government must undertake to keep the situation in the area calm. It must not take advantage of little incidents to launch reprisal riots. <pb xml:id="pg_791" n="791" facs="0819"/>It must not attempt at this time to force the Gulf of Aqaba.<note n="5" xml:id="d420fn5">On September 10, 1955, Egypt announced new regulations for shipping in the Gulf of Aqaba requiring all ships intending to sail through the Gulf to obtain Egypt’s permission at least 72 hours in advance. Egypt refused to grant the right of passage to Israel’s ships.</note> The Secretary said that he would tell <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> that under those conditions the U.S. would do all that it could to persuade the Arab states to reach a settlement. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> observed that that would be entirely in harmony with the joint US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> policy. The Secretary said that the Israel Government is obviously trying to drive a wedge between the U.S. and the U.K., especially following Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s Mansion House speech. The Secretary said that he would have liked it a little better if he had had a chance to see the speech somewhat more in advance of its delivery. The Secretary said that he feels that the reference to the 1947 resolution was unfortunate. It is not, in fact, the basis of the present Arab position. No one really thinks that the Galilee can be taken from Israel and the Negev, which the Arabs do want, is given to Israel under the 1947 resolution. However, the Secretary said, practically speaking, the US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> policies are in line and his remarks to <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> would show that there is no material difference in the position of the two countries. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> said that there had been some anxiety on the part of the Egyptians about a possible difference between the U.S. and U.K. positions. The Secretary said that <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> must understand that the present Near East situation imperils us as well as Israel and Israel “must put something more in the pot” to make a settlement possible.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we have received quite a substantial request for arms from the Israel Government.<note n="6" xml:id="d420fn6">See <ref target="#d413">Documents 413</ref>.</note> Most of the items are essentially defensive in nature but many of them could be turned to offensive purposes. A plan for coordinating Western arms deliveries to the Middle East was worked out in Geneva, which the Secretary feels is very important.<note n="7" xml:id="d420fn7">See <ref target="#d409">Document 409</ref>.</note> The French hold some reservations so that we are not yet in a position to go ahead with it but we should get it underway as soon as possible so that what one of our countries does is not nullified by what the others do.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he felt that it was important for the Italians to be included in the arrangements.<note n="8" xml:id="d420fn8">See <ref target="#d409fn3">footnote 3, Document 409</ref>.</note> Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> inquired as to whether the Italians would be brought in on much the same basis as the Canadians and the Belgians for instance. The Secretary said that he believed it was desirable to bring in the Italians as one of a four power undertaking and it was his impression <pb xml:id="pg_792" n="792" facs="0820"/>that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> had agreed to that. The Secretary said that he thought it would be helpful to the political situation in Italy in addition to making possible a more effective control of arms shipment. For these reasons he thought that the relationship on the part of the Italians should be one of equality with the other three powers. The U.K., U.S. and the French might meet in the first instance and draw up the general plan of operation but the Italians should be brought in as regular attendants at meetings after that. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> inquired whether the Italians should be a member of <gloss target="#t_NEACC1">NEACC</gloss>. The Secretary replied that he thought it would not be necessary for them to be a part of <gloss target="#t_NEACC1">NEACC</gloss>, although he had not made up his mind.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> referred to an instruction that he had received from the Foreign Office to consult with the Department about action which might be taken in the event of necessity under the Tripartite Declaration. The Secretary said that he thought that was a constructive suggestion and that we should begin consultation now. The Pentagon is not keen on the U.S. becoming militarily involved in the area. However, we have the means of exercising effective restraint on Israel by economic and financial measures and Great Britain could bring pressure to bear on Egypt through Egypt’s blocked sterling. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> said that the Arabs have recently been shifting their balances around, notably into Switzerland in order to remove them from British control.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary opened the discussion by saying that although he realized Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> had requested an appointment in order to make a courtesy call, he wished to take advantage of the occasion to speak of a matter of the greatest importance. The Secretary said he believes there is a possibility of moving toward a settlement along the lines of his August 26th speech. Two things are necessary, however, if further progress is to be made. First, there must be self-control and restraint on both sides so that there will not be a build up to an explosive border situation. There must not be any effort to compel a settlement of specific issues by force, in the Gulf of Aqaba for instance. Secondly, the Israel Government must be prepared to make some concession in the Negev which would make possible an area of contact between Egypt and the other Arab states. Such an area would not necessarily be large nor of great value. And the compensation to Israel from effecting a settlement would outweigh any loss of territory. The position of rigidly standing on the present armistice lines is not tenable. If there is to be a settlement, a lot of people will have to make contributions. The United States has indicated the contributions that it is prepared to make. The Arabs will have to retreat some from their position. So will the Israel Government. The Secretary said that he can understand that the Israel Government would not want the Arabs to know what concessions it would be prepared to make for a settlement until negotiations were well underway. But we must know that there is flexibility if we are going to be in a position to push things along. The Secretary said he could assure Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> that we are presenting our views on the other side as well although Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>, of course, only sees one side of it. <pb xml:id="pg_794" n="794" facs="0822"/>There are indications, the Secretary said, that Egypt is worried about the long-term consequences of its action in making a deal with the Soviet Bloc and that it is beginning to have second thoughts.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary handed an aide-mémoire to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d421fn2">See <ref target="#d424">Document 424</ref>.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> said that with respect to the first point, the necessity of maintaining calm along the borders, there had recently been a series of provocations along the Jordan border. Israel had made no reaction up to the present time and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> said he hoped it could continue to refrain from taking action, but he had to say there was a possibility that things would burst out of bounds.</p>
                        <p>Of graver concern was the Secretary’s second point, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> said. The Secretary had mentioned several times the need for concessions from both sides. But the Arabs are only asked to give up things they talk about, not anything they possess. Israel, however, is expected to give up territory it already possesses. If Egypt is to be given contiguity with Jordan, it can be done only in one of two ways: (1) by giving up the port of Elat and shrinking northwards; or, (2) by cutting a belt of land out of the Negev, in other words by cutting Israel in two. This is not fair and the Israel Government should not be asked to do it. The contiguity which Egypt now seeks never existed before. The present situation existed under the British Mandate. There is nothing vital in that contiguity. There are no roads that go through that part of the country, no railroads, and no traffic. There is nothing that would start moving through it. It is only a national slogan and for that Israel is expected to cut itself in two.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he wished to emphasize that we are talking about something of the greatest seriousness, namely, the threat to Israel and the grave threat of the relation of the Middle East to the free world as a whole. The West has great stakes in the Middle East. Israel is one of them. The United States does not intend to allow any of its other extremely important stakes in the area to threaten the existence of Israel. By the same token, we do not think that in the present international situation the Israel Government should allow the contribution which it can make to a settlement and which would not violate Israel’s vital interests, to stand in the way of a settlement. The extent and nature of the contribution should and must be a matter for discussion and development. But the Israel Government should not take the position of saying that it will not consider a solution that might be worked out.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> said that Israel, by its geographic position, is the hub of the area and this imposes an obligation on it to be a good neighbor which it intends to be if the Arab states would only be <pb xml:id="pg_795" n="795" facs="0823"/>good neighbors. Israel has offered to provide communication facilities for the Arabs across Israel territory, following a settlement, but giving up its sovereignty over present Israel territory to meet a whim of Nasir’s is another matter. Who can tell what Nasir would then go on to request? It would be the beginning of a slippery slope.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we are not talking about a whim. We are talking about the continued existence of Israel. All we are asking is for the Israel Government to tell us what it would be prepared to do. That would not be the beginning of a slippery slope. The Secretary said that he had a rule in dealing with the Soviet group not to agree to a change in his position in reliance upon Soviet promises. That is a rather good rule to follow in most international negotiations. He does not expect to give up something of value in advance of getting an adequate return. He is not naive and recognizes that there are many risks in this situation and that there could be some duplicity. But we do believe that, as a result of a combination of pressures and inducement, there is a chance for a settlement, whether 50–50 or 1 in 10, no one could say. It cannot, however, be explored without knowing what Israel’s position is going to be. If Israel says no then the possibility of a settlement is off and we shall all have to face the consequences. We believe that there is an appreciable chance for a settlement. It would give Israel peace. It would reverse the process of Soviet penetration in the Middle East. The Secretary said that he did not make this statement lightly. He was not engaging in mere wishful thinking. But any further attempt towards a settlement has to be based upon our knowledge that Israel will cooperate. We have not advanced far enough so that we are asking Israel to state its willingness to make concessions publicly but we must know whether Israel would be willing to make concessions or not. If “no” is the last word, then Israel is putting us all in great peril. If we have to make a choice of sticking to Israel in the face of all that the Middle East is to the safety and continued existence of the free world, Israel will be forcing us to make a very grave choice. If the present opportunities for a settlement are to be seized, it will be necessary for us to have Israel’s position in the next few days. We can not go any further in developing the possibilities of a settlement with the Arabs until we know Israel’s position.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> said that he saw no certainty that Egypt, if it knew Israel would agree to a settlement, would itself agree. There was no certainty, if Israel agreed, that such a concession would close the breach in the wall against Soviet penetration in the area. Israel leaders sat with Neville Chamberlain and Lord Halifax at the beginning of World War II and heard them say that the clouds were gathering, that the Allies must gather the Arabs to them, and that on those grounds they were forced to repudiate the 1939 White <pb xml:id="pg_796" n="796" facs="0824"/>Paper.<note n="3" xml:id="d421fn3">Dated May 17, 1939. (<hi rend="italic">Palestine: Statement of Policy. Cmd. 6019</hi>)</note> War broke out but the Arabs did not rally to the Allies. The only thing that brought the Arabs to the Allied side was the Allied victory. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> said that he did not dispute the purity of the Secretary’s intentions but it is results and not intentions that count. He said he did not see Israel capable of making the concession that the Secretary asked.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that in Korea and Formosa there were governments, faced by Communist mass power, that felt the only way out was in world war, wherever the U.S. would defeat their enemies. He said he assumed that Israel would not want to get into that situation vis-á
-vis the Arabs, that it would not want to go down a road where there would be no solution short of general war. The Secretary said he was against peace at any price as much as anyone but that one cannot be blind to the fact that the scales are more heavily weighted against war than at any time in history. The sacrifices that are called for to save peace are greater. No one is suggesting that Israel do anything that would cripple it. But it is necessary for us to know whether there is flexibility in Israel’s immediate answer and he hoped that he would not give him a negative answer. The consequences to everyone concerned would be most serious.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he wished to say that the views of the United States and the United Kingdom are very close. He had not seen <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s speech until a few hours before it was given. He would not have put things in just the way that <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> did but he did not want Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> to think that there is any sharp divergence that could be exploited to advantage. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> said that it was not a question of exploiting a difference, it was a question of whether the United States concurred in <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s idea of a compromise. The Secretary said that we are not engaged in an intellectual dialectic. We are faced with a very practical situation and that it was a matter of importance for him to know whether, to make possible a settlement that could be of infinite value to Israel, Israel would be willing to give up something of comparatively little value. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> said that if it was a question of give and take, of exchanging territory on a small scale on the principle of mutuality, it could be discussed but that Israel could not give up vital points, such as Elat, nor could it agree to something that would result in cutting Israel in two.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he would like to have the Israel Government’s answer in writing. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> said that it would take two or three days.</p>

                        <head>422. Editorial Note</head>
                        <p>On November 21, at the 267th Meeting of the National Security Council, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, in the course of his report to the National Security Council about the Geneva Meeting of Foreign Ministers, offered the following analysis of the Near Eastern situation:</p>
                        <p>“Lastly, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he would touch on the problems of the Near East. In the main, our policies toward that area had been run from Washington by Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName>, although Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had likewise been involved while at Geneva.</p>
                        <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> expressed the view that there could be little doubt but that the Soviets had deliberately opened a new cold war front in the Near East. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> had been very evasive when the Secretary had questioned him on Soviet policy toward that area, and had kept insisting that the arms deal with Egypt was a simple commercial transaction from which no serious political repercussions were to be expected. It was obvious, continued Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, that the Soviet moves in the Near East confronted the West with a very grave situation… . We needed to watch this situation very carefully. For some 25 years we had observed the Communists going to work to bring China under their control. We had done nothing about it until it was too late. We could not afford to repeat this mistake with regard to the Middle East or Africa.</p>
                        <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then said he did not believe that the Arab governments were entirely happy over the prospect of possible future dependence on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. It was obvious that they wanted to play off the West against the Soviet bloc, but if they were compelled to choose one or another, they wouldn’t be very happy to choose the Soviet bloc. On the other hand, they might be forced to make such a choice if the West became identified with Israel in active hostilities between Israel and the Arab States. The only solution that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> could perceive for the short-range problem was a general solution of the quarrel between the Israelis and the Arabs. Such a solution he believed by no means impossible. Our policies and those of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> were pretty much alike, though Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> expressed some distaste for Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s recent speech on the Near East situation. He said that <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> had tried to drag him into supporting this speech at the very last minute, but that he, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, had bucked at full endorsement. After all, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out, his own speech of August 26 on this situation had been discussed for weeks in advance with the British and his proposals cleared with them before the speech was made.</p>
                        <p>“Nevertheless, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that no significant cleavage between the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> on Near Eastern policy could be permitted. It was plain enough that the United Kingdom was trying very hard to swing support over to the side of the Arabs and to regain the lost British position with the Arab States. While this was understandable, it was simply impossible to ignore the position of the Israeli Government. If we did so the Israelis might move in such a way as to bring down the whole house.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_798" n="798" facs="0826"/>
                        <p>“This reminded Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> that he had had a serious talk with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> at the State Department this morning. [See supra] Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had urged <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> to remain calm and to avoid incidents involving the Arabs even if provocation existed. It had been a good talk. The Israelis had presented us with a large request for arms. Accordingly, in the course of his conversation Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had referred to the fact that the U.S., along with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, was setting up a group to exchange views on arms requests from Middle Eastern countries before any action was taken. [See <ref target="#d418">Document 418</ref>] Apropos of the Israeli-Arab situation as a whole, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that while he regarded it as extremely dangerous, it was not more so than other difficulties which we have encountered and surmounted.” (Eisenhower Library, Whitman File, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Records)</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> in describing our great interest in the High Aswan Dam project illustrated its tremendous magnitude by pointing out that relative to the size of the respective economies it is larger than the total of all US public works of this type produced since 1900. This underlined the importance of ample technical preparation and solid financing. The World Bank he thought is the logical institution for a project of this magnitude and best equipped to handle the job efficiently and economically. He said we would keep in touch with the Bank and encourage it all we could. Mr. Kaissouni responded by saying that the magnitude of the economic problems facing Egypt require bold action; “if Egypt could build the Pyramids alone it could with outside help handle the High Dam.” He referred to his <pb xml:id="pg_799" n="799" facs="0827"/>conversation with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> of the World Bank<note n="2" xml:id="d423fn2">No record of this conversation, which apparently took place on November 21, has been found in Department of State files.</note> mentioning that the principal questions raised by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> had to do with the source of financing external costs and the division of the Nile waters. The nature of these problems he thought underlined the importance of US help.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the division of Nile waters, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> said we would do all we could to help toward a settlement but the temporary absence of a government in the Sudan made progress difficult.<note n="3" xml:id="d423fn3">See <ref target="#d405fn2">footnote 2, Document 405</ref>.</note> He was hopeful this would soon be resolved but we needed more facts to be of real assistance. He thought the British were in a better position to help. Considerable discussion followed concerning the details of this problem and the 50–50 offer which the Egyptians recently made to the Sudanese. He felt the 50–50 offer was generous; it would provide the Sudanese more water than they could use for many years. The discussion on this point clarified the meaning of Egypt’s proposal. All the Egyptians want is a Sudanese guarantee not to use up within the Sudan more than half the water presently “wasted” into the sea.</p>
                        <p>In response to the opinion that a settlement with the Sudanese of this matter was prerequisite to a Bank decision, Mr. Kaissouni expressed hope that enough “prospect of settlement” could be reached to persuade the Bank to move on the first stages of the project. He felt that the Sudanese position was now an internal political affair. It was pointed out that if the Dam project were started prior to reasonably firm settlement the Sudanese might later demand an even higher price for an agreement. In response to question Mr. Kaissouni felt the present Sudanese Government could ratify an agreement and that, in the absence of agreement, a mutually accepted decision to arbitrate the matter should enable Egypt to go ahead with the Dam. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hussein</persName> pointed out that under the terms of a 1929 agreement<note n="4" xml:id="d423fn4">On May 7, 1929, representatives of the Governments of Egypt and the United Kingdom signed a treaty that provided for the regulation of the supply of Nile water to Egypt and, at the same time, safeguarded the interests of the population of the Sudan. For text, see <hi rend="italic">British and Foreign State Papers, 1929, Part 1</hi>, volume 130, pp. 104–106.</note> the present Sudanese Government was bound to accept arbitration of such matters as this.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kaissouni, reporting on his conversation with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName>, said the latter thought the Bank might be able to put up about $200 million of his estimated $600 million required for external costs of the project. It was the large difference between these two figures which required outside assistance from other sources over a period of approximately a decade. In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName>’s query <pb xml:id="pg_800" n="800" facs="0828"/>regarding the possibility of short term credits as a possible offset to long term loans, Mr. Kaissouni referred to the British, French and German Consortium’s offer of medium term export credits approximating<note n="5" xml:id="d423fn5">For <persName corresp="#p_AWW1">Aldrich</persName>’s summary of Kaissouni’s conversation with <persName corresp="#p_BRA1">Butler</persName>, as related to <persName corresp="#p_AWW1">Aldrich</persName> by <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>, see <ref target="#d399">Document 399</ref>.</note> million pounds each. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA1">Butler</persName> told him in London 5 this figure could be enlarged. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName>, however, took the position that short term financing was incompatible with long term financing by the Bank. If Egypt could handle a $400 million loan of any type, the Bank itself would be able to provide credit; this type of financing would only reduce Egypt’s credit worthiness in the Bank’s eyes. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> added in this connection that long term financing by facilitating cash payments to contractors was in his experience the most efficient procedure, offering possibilities of savings and fuller competitive bidding.</p>
                        <p>In regard to competitive bidding Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> stressed that all the US desired was that American firms be given an opportunity to bid equal to that offered any other firms. Mr. Kaissouni seemed to imply that competitive bidding was synonymous with splitting up or proliferation of contracts. He felt that dealing with one group offered greater efficiency; it would permit going ahead before details of the whole project were ready. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> replied that the employment of able consulting engineers to handle the planning and coordinating of the total project should meet this difficulty; he thought that the Bank’s method of operation would permit going ahead on parts of the project before the completion of all detailed plans or bidding on all phases.</p>
                        <p>In response to the question whether or not Egypt itself could finance and otherwise go ahead with the coffer dam and tunnels, Mr. Kaissouni replied in the affirmative but stressed that Egypt wanted assurance that the whole project could be carried forward before launching this first phase. He expressed great hope that he could reach an understanding with the Bank before he returned to Cairo. He got the impression, however, that the Bank wants a US commitment as a prerequisite to its own decision.</p>
                        <p>Following Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName>’s observation that more information re basic figures is needed before commitments are possible, Mr. Kaissouni alleged that Egypt would be able from its own resources to handle the additional requirements over and above what the Bank, the US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> might provide. No specific amounts, however, were mentioned in this connection. In the course of discussing the dangers of inflation Mr. Kaissouni recognized the importance of how Egypt raised its own funds. He thought there was considerable scope for public borrowing and for tapping potential investment funds of <pb xml:id="pg_801" n="801" facs="0829"/>insurance companies and other local institutions without significant inflationary impact. He alleged there were large amounts of funds available in Egypt for investment in government bonds.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> alluded to the possibility that American agriculture will fear expanded output of cotton in Egypt as a result of the increase in cultivable land. He hoped that we could meet this problem or that natural developments will have erased it by the time the Dam is built. We have been under great pressures from the cotton growers to subsidize export of our surplus cotton. He was hopeful we could continue to resist these pressures. Mr. Kaissouni observed that Egypt was cutting back cotton production next year and that he had talked to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> about a possible international agreement to control cotton planting. He said if the US imposed an export subsidy Egypt would have to respond by reducing its cotton prices at great loss to itself. Egypt’s cotton exports were off about 10 million pounds this year due largely to the uncertainty of the cotton market. Egypt was much concerned that this instability be eliminated.</p>
                        <p>In concluding the conversation Mr. Kaissouni did not appear to be highly encouraged from his conversation with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName>; apparently the contrary was the case in respect to his earlier conversations with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA1">Butler</persName> in London. He again stressed his hope that the project should go ahead without waiting for final agreement with the Sudan; otherwise, since the Sudanese were not in a hurry, there might be long delay. In this connection Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> thought the British could give positive assistance. He expressed his conviction that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> personally was very hopeful regarding the High Aswan Dam project. As an international servant, however, and as a banker he should quite properly be meticulous and cautious in an enterprise of this magnitude. He hoped Mr. Kaissouni would keep in touch with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> and that following his talks with the Bank there might be ways in which we could be helpful. We would follow the matter closely with the Bank.<note n="6" xml:id="d423fn6">The Department on November 23 transmitted a summary of this conversation to the Embassy in Cairo.

                        <p>1051. Secretary gave <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> Nov 21 aide-mémoire quoted below. Separate telegram follows reporting conversation.<note n="2" xml:id="d424fn2">Telegram 1062 to Cairo, November 23, also sent to London and Tel Aviv. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 684A.86/11–2355)</note> You may discuss matter with British. Otherwise you should not reveal fact or substance of meeting in any way.</p>
                        <p>“In the opinion of the United States Government a settlement of the principal issues of the Israel-Arab dispute is essential if Israel is in the long run to survive. This has become more urgent in view of the apparent intention of the Soviet Government now to seek for its own purposes to implement Arab hostility to Israel.</p>
                        <p>The United States Government believes that a settlement may be possible if the Governments concerned accept the approach outlined by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> in his August 26th speech, an approach which involves concessions by Arab States as well as by Israel.</p>
                        <p>It is, however, in our opinion, of the utmost importance that the Governments concerned do everything in their power to maintain calm along the armistice lines, even in the face of provocations. They should cooperate to the fullest with General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName>. Israel, for example, would not seek to compel the settlement of specific issues by force, such as the right of transit in the Gulf of Aqaba.</p>
                        <p>We believe that it should be recognized that the territorial adjustments referred to in Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ August 26th speech may have to include concessions in the Negev to provide an Arab area joining Egypt with the rest of the Arab world. These concessions need not, as we see it, involve loss of any appreciably populated land or land of any substantial economic value.</p>
                        <p>The settlement, outlined by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ August 26th speech, would, as there indicated, involve very considerable contributions, both political and economic, by the United States. We believe, however, that it is indispensable that the Governments directly concerned should also be prepared to make contributions. The positive value to Israel of such a settlement, in terms of a prosperous and viable existence, would be incomparably greater than what it is suggested might be required of Israel to procure that settlement.</p>

Re Palestine. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> Hammarskjold called meeting of France, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and US this morning at which he proposed <pb xml:id="pg_805" n="805" facs="0833"/>report to us on latest developments in Palestine. When meeting opened Hammarskjold passed 6-page memorandum (pouched today)<note n="2" xml:id="d427fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BJW1">Barco</persName> sent <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName>’s memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Ludlow</persName>. A copy is <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., <gloss target="#t_UNP1">UNP</gloss> Files: Lot 58 D 224, Palestine.</note> relating General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName>’ efforts to arrive at an agreement on his 3-point program for the El Auja Demilitarized Zone<note n="3" xml:id="d427fn3">For General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName>’ program, see <ref target="#d376">Documents 376</ref> and <ref target="#d382">382</ref>.</note> and the attitudes of Egypt and Israel. The concluding paragraphs of the memorandum state that Egypt “While not rejecting the proposals, have suggested certain additional points for consideration. Egypt feels that the special character of the Kibbutz and of the civil police which they consider military in character, taken together with the presence of Israeli forces in the defensive area east of the <gloss target="#t_DZ1">DZ</gloss>, constitute a direct threat to the security of Egyptian forces, and that consequently Egypt needs defensive positions at the western end of the defensive area west of the <gloss target="#t_DZ1">DZ</gloss>. As regards the marking of the western boundary of the <gloss target="#t_DZ1">DZ</gloss>, Egypt has proposed the marking of all sides of the zone both to distinguish clearly between the zone and the adjacent areas as well as to rebut the contention of Israel that the <gloss target="#t_DZ1">DZ</gloss> is its sovereign territory”.</p>
                        <p>The report goes on to say that “the Government of Israel, while stating that they accept the proposals in principle, have likewise advanced certain conditions with regard to their implementation ….<note n="4" xml:id="d427fn4">Ellipsis in the source text.</note> Furthermore, the Israelis have attempted to introduce into the discussion regarding the three-point program the allegation that Egypt is responsible for organizing raids into Israel territory in areas other than the <gloss target="#t_DZ1">DZ</gloss>; they have, thus, tended to make it a condition of Israeli acceptance of the proposals that Egypt should give satisfactory guarantees that such raids would cease. In recent public statements, the Israeli press has attempted to link together the allegation that Egypt has rejected the proposals with accusations that Egypt is responsible for organizing these raids. This development presents a parallel to the press build-up which preceded the Israeli military action of 2 November.”<note n="5" xml:id="d427fn5">See <ref target="#d381fn6">footnote 6, Document 381</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Cordier stated that Israel is now relating the problem of the <gloss target="#t_DZ1">DZ</gloss> to raids from Jordan. He read from a report which had just come in that the <hi rend="italic">Jerusalem Post</hi> was making much of the fact that there had in recent days been 21 raids from Jordan with no return fire from Israel. Cordier also said that <persName>Burns</persName> is putting three questions to Israel as follows:</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_806" n="806" facs="0834"/>
                        <p>1. Israeli withdrawal from the <gloss target="#t_DZ1">DZ</gloss> and limitation of truly civilian police to 30;</p>
                        <p>2. Withdrawal of checkposts from a distance of 1,000 meters from Egyptian posts (this is a change from the old idea of a straight 500 meter withdrawal zone, and is probably more practical since it avoids any impression of making more permanent the temporary frontier);</p>
                        <p>3. Freedom of movement of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> observers.</p>
                        <p>Hammarskjold said that all initiative for the present was in <persName>Burns</persName>’ hands and that he did not propose to approach the Egyptians or Israelis in New York.</p>
                        <p>Hammarskjold then said that he proposed to raise the question of Palestine at tomorrow’s monthly luncheon of the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> members and to circulate to the members at the luncheon his above memorandum. He said he felt that the information it contained should be made available to members of the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> and it was preferable for him to do so at a private meeting of all the members rather than to inform them individually.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WGE1">Wadsworth</persName> told Hammarskjold that we had reservations about desirability of raising this question at an informal meeting of the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> members. Hammarskjold argued that since the information he planned to give the Council members was appropriate for him to give them individually or to use in a report to a public meeting of the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>, he could see no basis for any objection. <persName corresp="#p_WGE1">Wadsworth</persName> pointed out that some of the language of the report indicated conclusions as to the intent of the parties and questioned the wisdom of circulating such conclusions at such a meeting.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Dixon</persName> was not present during this part of the discussion and Ramsbotham, speaking for the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, suggested that Hammarskjold might make an oral report at the luncheon meeting, basing his remarks on the memorandum and then, if a member should ask for a memorandum, he could supply it. Hammarskjold quickly accepted this suggestion and said that he would act accordingly. <persName corresp="#p_BJW1">Barco</persName> again for the US raised the question of the desirability of a discussion of the Palestine question at an informal meeting of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> members (with Soviets present) and reiterated our reservations regarding the utilization of informal luncheons of the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> for such business. Hammarskjold said this would reopen the whole question of the purpose of the luncheons, that he had a clear understanding with the members of the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> that this was indeed the purpose of the monthly luncheons and that on the basis of this understanding he intended to proceed as he had indicated. He also stated that he intended his report to be simply information for the members and that no “discussion” should or would ensue. We doubt that this is a very realistic expectation.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_807" n="807" facs="0835"/>
                        <p>It should be pointed out that the Secretary General is tending to his original proposal for private, informal <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> business meetings which he proposed in July, and to which we took exception. I am under the impression that we do not wish at this time to provide any opportunity for Soviets to contend that they are entering into discussions with us, outside the regular public meetings of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, on the Middle East, and on this basis I feel that I should object to Hammarskjold’s raising the Palestine question in this way at a luncheon to be attended by the Soviet representative.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 684A.86/11–1955)</note> He aware of talks of <persName corresp="#p_TSH1">Trevelyan</persName> and I with <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> and took same general line. Wishing however be more specific, stated felt it important that I be able report he fully aware of and stood behind specific positions given by <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> on November 16. He said he thought so, but perhaps I had better outline for him my understanding of <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName>’s position.</p>
                        <p>I thereupon read to him full contents of paragraphs on tactics and substance of <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 976<note n="3" xml:id="d428fn3">
                                <ref target="#d416">Document 416</ref>.</note> (omitting only sentences enclosed in parentheses in subparagraph c on subject Eilath). We went through contents sentence by sentence discussing their implications in sufficient detail to insure against lack of understanding. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> agreed message accurate and expressed his own views with one reservation on subject of refugees.</p>
                        <p>He agreed majority of refugees would no longer desire return Israel or would not remain after they saw present conditions. (He referred to lot of the Arab in Israel as that of “Class B” citizens.) He thought however it would be most difficult for any Arab leader to take a position which deprived the refugee of his right to return. He <pb xml:id="pg_808" n="808" facs="0836"/>therefore favored an approach which would allow the refugee to make his own decision about repatriation vis-à-vis resettlement and compensation. He agreed that this would be most difficult for Israel and wondered whether some impartial sensing of the real refugee opinion was possible through an agency such as <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> which could relieve both Israel and Arabs of difficult political problem. Told him I feared any such poll would indicate a far greater desire to return to Israel than would be actual case if opportunity were in fact presented.</p>
                        <p>It is probably academic to attempt pursue this particular question much farther at moment. I found it encouraging however that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> would endorse, with this reservation, such a specifically worded message to Department. It is hardly a surprise however as both <persName corresp="#p_TSH1">Trevelyan</persName> and I felt <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> would not have been so forthcoming on his own.</p>

(Telegram 838 from Cairo; Department of State, Central Files, 874.2614/10–3055)</note> I understand that the main difficulty the International Bank has in helping the Egyptians is that they <pb xml:id="pg_809" n="809" facs="0837"/>should pay some regard to their usual rule of international tendering. If this is insisted upon and the Egyptians leave Washington without agreement, I fear the Russians are certain to get the contract. Poland will act as a stooge in this case as Czechoslovakia did for the arms. The Bank are not unnaturally anxious about the position of the Egyptian economy over the next thirty year outlook and want to be assured that there is some outside finance in addition to the money which the Bank will themselves put up. We are prepared to do our small part in supporting our share of the consortium and there is also the question of the other two Governments involved namely the French and the German Governments. We believe that they will play their part. It would be invaluable to get the help of your Government, it being always understood that in that event an American firm would take part in the operation.</p>
                        <p>I hate to trouble you with this but I am convinced that on our joint success in excluding the Russians from this contract may depend the future of Africa. I hope to have the chance of a talk with you when it suits you about the whole of this situation but meanwhile we must avert the disaster of the two Egyptians leaving Washington without the conviction that agreement is going to be reached.</p>

                        <p>The President called me on the telephone this morning.</p>
                        <p>He asked me to tell you upon your return<note n="2" xml:id="d430fn2">According to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ Appointment Book, he was vacationing at his retreat on Duck Island in Lake Ontario from the afternoon of November 23 until the early afternoon of November 28. Upon his arrival in Washington, he went to the Department of State, where he met with <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName>. (Princeton University Library, Dulles Papers)</note> that he would have <pb xml:id="pg_810" n="810" facs="0838"/>no objection to <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s coming over in January.<note n="3" xml:id="d430fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> suggested such a visit in a personal message of November 23 to <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>, stating that the main purpose would be “to talk over the world scene together.” (Eisenhower Library, Whitman File, International File)</note> In making arrangements he preferred that <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> would not be there during a weekend, as he finds it desirable to rest up. I told him that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> had hinted that <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> might like to come over earlier, and would be ready to come at any time we called for him. The President did not indicate that he thought an earlier meeting was necessary, though he had no objection if you thought it desirable.</p>
                        <p>The President raised the matter of the Aswan Dam and I told him that we were fairly well agreed to proceed with the project, and that we were now endeavoring to assess our position and how far we would be committed.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the Middle East situation generally, I told the President that we had many disquieting developments within the last few days. I said that I was going to recommend that Bob Anderson should go to Cairo within about the next week, after we had cleared our own position on the Aswan Dam, in order to try our best to arrive at an understanding with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>.<note n="4" xml:id="d430fn4">No documentation has been found in Department of State files to indicate that <persName>Anderson</persName> journeyed to Cairo at that time.</note> The President suggested that Milton Eisenhower<note n="5" xml:id="d430fn5">The President’s brother, who was President of Pennsylvania State University.</note> might be useful in such a capacity. I said I felt sure he could be at a suitable opportunity, but we were trying to keep the matter confidential during the earlier stages and I thought Bob Anderson would probably attract less attention than Milton.</p>
                        <p>I said that the Aswan Dam project was the largest single project yet undertaken anywhere in the world, and the complications were almost unbelievable. He said he had no appreciation before of the magnitude of the proposal and he could well see that it was not a thing where a solution could be found on short notice; nevertheless, we were hopeful that we would be able to make a commitment to go ahead on a general basis within the next week or 10 days.</p>
                        <p>The President suggested that late tomorrow morning when he goes to the office in Gettysburg you might wish to call him on the secret telephone from the <persName corresp="#p_WGTD1">White</persName> House. A definite time should be set up in advance.<note n="6" xml:id="d430fn6">The Secretary spoke with the President late in the afternoon of November 29 about <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s projected visit, and <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> reiterated his approval.

                        <p>555. In the course of separate conversations yesterday with Eytan, Kollek and <persName corresp="#p_HCC1">Herzog</persName>, I was informed as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. Distribution <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>’s 1500-word telegraphic report <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>’s talk with Secretary on November 21 has been limited to foregoing plus <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MGMG1">Myerson</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> was characterized as having been taken by surprise and as having submitted no recommendations on the talk. When <persName corresp="#p_HCC1">Herzog</persName> and, later, Kollek commenced discuss substance of talk, I informed them I was under injunction not to discuss the matter.</p>
                        <p>2. Was given impression that government had made no decision to retaliate for recent incidents and that no reprisals were planned unless new incidents involving mortalities created unusual public pressure for action. Consensus <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> thinking is that arms aid problem greatly overshadowed all others and was serving to restrain <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> behavior in less vital matters.</p>
                        <p>3. Tolkowsky, Chief <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> Air Force, yesterday gave <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName> intelligence estimate of Egyptian receipts Soviet aircraft and their impact on Israel’s security position. According to Kollek, <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> has photographs “substantial number” of MIG’s on an airfield near Alexandria and also several MIG’s located airfield Suez area. <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> also has tentatively identified 5 to 7 Ilyushin two-motor jet bombers in Egyptian possession. Kollek said <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> was banking heavily on French promises deliveries Mystères but added French had “crossed them up” in past (General Dayan told me last night <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> wanted Mystere IV; that the II was no good).</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_HCC1">Herzog</persName> said that key question future Israel course of action would arise when Dayan informs Cabinet that Egyptian receipts Soviet arms were reaching point where <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> could no longer be responsible for the security of the state. He added his judgment that <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> would be satisfied if it could obtain from US enough planes and other items to cope successfully with the rapid increment in Egyptian strength. On this point Kollek made surprising statement that US policy should be to maintain arms situation between Egypt and Israel under which neither party could successfully launch an offensive war. He thought Israel would be satisfied with a smaller number of planes then Egypt was receiving provided the discrepancy was not <pb xml:id="pg_812" n="812" facs="0840"/>greater than could be compensated by superior Israel techniques and maintenance.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: While I have no means of knowing whether information regarding Egyptian plane receipts is substantially correct, I believe the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> will press vigorously for rapid compensating deliveries Mystere IV’s and F–86’s from France and US. Israeli’s mood now that they are faced with the fact rather than the theory of survival is one of less truculence and less belligerency. Reports from several sources indicate that <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName> is allergic to preventive war concept and would like to find a practicable alternative.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Assistance to Egypt in Financing the High Aswan Dam</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName> said that before getting on to the second scheduled item on the agenda, the Secretary of State wished to make a report to the National Security Council on the subject of financing the High Aswan Dam in Egypt.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> expressed the belief that while the forthcoming proposal for U.S. assistance in the financing of this Dam fell within existing national security policy for the area, such large funds were involved that he had believed it right to report the plan to the National Security Council. He said that he would ask Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> to report on the main provisions of the plan.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> explained that the State Department had reached the conclusion that it was essential to go ahead with the plan for assisting the Egyptians to construct this Dam. Conversations had been going on both with the International Bank and with the British. The latter had committed themselves to go along with us in helping to finance the project, and had also agreed to go along with our proposal to bring in the International Bank. They had abandoned their previous view of the desirability of a consortium. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> then proceeded to summarize the three major steps which Would be taken in developing the program for providing assistance to the Egyptians.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName>’s exposition, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that while we have been busy working on our own plan for assisting the Egyptians with this Dam, there were strong indications that the Soviet Union in turn was doing its best to bring off a deal with the Egyptians on the Dam. Accordingly, even if the United States made the generous proposal outlined by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName>, the Russians might duplicate it, and it was possible that the Egyptians would take the Soviet offer. Nevertheless, it seemed essential to make this serious and liberal offer to the Egyptian Government. If the Egyptians accepted, it would certainly be highly impractical for Egypt to switch to a Soviet satellite status, at least while the project was in the course of construction. Moreover, the presence of so many engineers, technicians, and other people from the free world in Egypt, would constitute a strong influence in keeping Egypt on the side of the free world.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that without expressing a judgment as to whether or not it was wise to make this offer to the Egyptian Government, he believed that there were a certain number of basic facts which he wished to bring out in order that the National <pb xml:id="pg_814" n="814" facs="0842"/>Security Council would have a clear understanding of the implications of the proposed offer to Egypt. In the first place, the over-all cost figure of $1.3 billion for completing the project, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, was just a beginning. To complete this project over a period of from 20 to 25 years would, in his opinion, cost $2 billion. After going into further details to substantiate this cost estimate, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> pointed out that for the next 12 to 15 years the United States Government was going to have to bear down on the Egyptians in order to induce them to live on the austere basis which would be necessary if this project were to be carried to completion. This was going to be very tough on the Egyptian people, but the austerity was essential if the project was to be brought into production. The United States in turn was going to be under constant Egyptian pressure to provide additional economic assistance in order to cushion the austerity. Accordingly, it was Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>’s guess that we would never get out of this business without additional annual contributions to Egypt above the foreign exchange figure of some $200 million which we would provide by way of foreign exchange for carrying out the project.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> then said that there was another fundamental fact which the National Security Council would do well to ponder. All of us here were believers in a free society based on free economic competition. But what we would be doing in Egypt would be tantamount to creating a completely nationalized project which would have the effect of handing over the economy of Egypt entirely into the hands of the Egyptian Government. In Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>’s view, the results of this move could not be more completely Communistic if it had been the deliberate attempt of the United States to make it so. Moreover, the by-product, in the shape of additional cotton and other products from the newly developed agricultural lands, would result in additional competition with the U.S. for markets.</p>
                        <p>In any event, continued Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, these were certain fundamentals which the Council should keep in mind. This fashion of assisting in the building of the High Aswan Dam amounted to a terrific example of the United States devoting itself to building up a socialized economy in Egypt for all the world to look at. All this was bound to have enduring repercussions. Is this, inquired Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, how we propose to compete with the Soviet Union in the forthcoming economic struggle? Of course, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> admitted, Russia could very well make all kinds of promises to Egypt to finance the projected Dam. If accepted, Russia would send in her people in large numbers. They would run all over Egypt, ultimately Communize it, and then say they were unable to go through with the project. This, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, seemed to <pb xml:id="pg_815" n="815" facs="0843"/>be the alternative we face; but nevertheless real difficulties were going to be raised for us if we adopted the proposal for assistance which had been outlined earlier.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>’s comment, the President said he would like to reply first to the point raised by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> regarding the increased competition between U.S. and Egyptian cotton raisers which would result from the completion of the High Aswan Dam. The President pointed out that the building of the Dam would inevitably take a good many years. In less than fifty years the population of the United States would increase by something more than 50,000 [<hi rend="italic">50,000,000</hi>?] people. This population increase would help our own farmers and soften any blow which might result from increased Egyptian production.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the President said he would comment on Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>’s point about contributing to the development of a socialized economy in Egypt. The President pointed out that the United States itself had never and would never venture on any enterprise of the scale of the High Aswan Dam except through the instrumentality of the Government and Government financing. This had been true of the <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> Dam and a great many similar projects, all of which had been financed with Federal funds. Accordingly, it did not seem to the President that the United States was actually departing from its traditional principles in assisting the Egyptians with their project, although he admitted that this was a sobering decision for the Government to make.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> wondered whether it might not be possible to enlist a certain amount of private Egyptian capital to assist in financing the Dam. If this were done, a certain number, at least, of private citizens in Egypt would have a stake in the completed project.</p>
                        <p>In reply to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s inquiry, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> repeated that the basic cost of the enterprise was $1.3 billion. The new land made available for cultivation as a result of the construction of the Dam, would be privately and not collectively worked. Of this total of $1.3 billion, the sum of $400 million or $500 million would be necessary to provide foreign exchange. This sum would be provided by the International Bank, the United States, and the United Kingdom. The other $900 million would have to be raised by the Egyptians in Egypt. It was bound to include a certain percentage of private capital. Moreover, continued Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName>, the Egyptians appeared to be aware of the heavy burden they are facing for the future, although Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> admitted that the United States would probably have to intervene from time to time with additional assistance if the Egyptians were to carry this burden.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_816" n="816" facs="0844"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that there was one other important aspect of this proposal which needed to be brought out. He felt that implicit in this proposed program of assistance would be the fact that the Egyptians were going to reach some genuine understanding with Israel. Certainly the Egyptians could never undertake so large and costly an enterprise as this and simultaneously carry on a great armament competition or a war with Israel. The necessity for this understanding with the Israelis couldn’t be explicitly stated by us as a part of our assistance agreement, but Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> was sure that it could be made obvious in the course of development.</p>
                        <p>As far as the question of money was concerned, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said the amount to be contributed by the United States did not really involve a great deal larger contribution than the United States would probably be obliged to spend in this area if we continued the present level of our existing assistance programs. It merely meant that our expenditures to assist Egypt would serve a more useful and fruitful end. His one great worry, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, was that a number of other nations would expect help from the United States similar to that which would be given to Egypt. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> broke in to express hearty agreement with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ fears. Nevertheless, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, there was no sound reason why the United States could not assist in financing projects similar to the Dam in various other underdeveloped countries—provided the International Bank would assist, provided our contribution was no greater proportionately, and provided the projects which we were to undertake to assist in construction were as sound and useful as this Dam in Egypt. There was a certain obvious advantage to the United States in undertaking such conspicuous and useful projects as the Dam, and all in all, he believed the outlook not as forbidding as might now appear at first glance.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> expressed grave doubts as to whether other projects in other underdeveloped countries would be as meritorious as the High Aswan Dam. Moreover, he said he would prophesy that at least a half dozen other countries would insist that the projects for which they sought U.S. assistance were every bit as meritorious as the Egyptian project.</p>
                        <p>The President intervened to point out his view that the International Bank would be of great help to us in screening the various projects suggested by other countries. If these projects seemed of doubtful value and U.S. assistance had to be refused, some of the onus would fall on the Bank and not all of it on the United States Government. … It all seemed to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> a case of “damned if you do and damned if you don’t.”</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> spoke in support of the proposed plan of U.S. assistance, and said that the only thing that really worried him about <pb xml:id="pg_817" n="817" facs="0845"/>it was the “socialistic aspect”. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> added that what really worried him was the fear that Egypt would turn down our proposal and accept a Soviet counter-proposal.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> said he felt compelled to point out to the Council one very discouraging aspect of this proposal. When the High Aswan Dam project was finally completed and in operation, the arable land available to Egypt would be increased by 30%. On the other hand, by that time the population of Egypt will have increased to such a point that the addition of the new arable land would accomplish no appreciable improvement in the Egyptian standard of living.</p>
                        <p>At this point the President, smiling, turned to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> and asked him if he remembered the famous World War I cartoon: “If you knows a better ’ole, go to it.” Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> replied that he guessed he “died hard”.</p>

                        <p rend="center">U.S. POLICY ON FINANCING HIGH ASWAN DAM IN EGYPT</p>
                        <p>The Egyptian Finance Minister, Kaissouni, has been discussing the financing of the High Aswan Dam with the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and representatives of the United States and United Kingdom Governments. The Egyptian Government attaches great importance to this project. The dam would provide Egypt a one-third increase in cultivable area, more food, and a higher national income; it would control Nile floods and provide power for future industrialization. It has been the subject of a political commitment by the present government to the Egyptian people. The total cost of the dam and other investment projects is estimated at $1.8 billion of which the cost attributable to the dam is $1.1 billion. Ten years would be required to complete the project. The Egyptian Government is determined to advance this project and would probably accept a Soviet offer of assistance if help cannot be obtained from the West. Western financing of the project is therefore necessary if the threat of Soviet penetration is to be avoided.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> has already informed Dr. Kaissouni that it would lend Egypt $200 million of the foreign exchange component estimated at $500 million provided Egypt could raise sufficient local currency, agree on division of the Nile waters with the Sudan, establish appropriate administrative procedures, and contract no other foreign debts.</p>
                        <p>It is recommended that the following course of action be undertaken:</p>
                        <p>1. Before going ahead with the project, the United States should obtain an agreement with the United Kingdom providing that:</p>
                        <p>(a) Of the total financing by the U.K. and the U.S., the U.K. share should be not less than 20 per cent;</p>
                        <p>(b) The U.K. is prepared to join with the U.S., the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>, and the Egyptian Government in support of the arrangement set forth in this statement.</p>
                        <p>2. The U.S. and the U.K. would present separate but coordinated letters of intent to the Egyptians stating that the U.S. and the U.K. are prepared to aid in the financing of the High Aswan Dam, as follows:</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_819" n="819" facs="0847"/>
                        <p>(a) By making a joint grant contribution towards the foreign exchange cost—estimated at $30.8 to $42 million—of the initial phase of the project comprising construction of the several cofferdams and diversion tunnels over the period 1956–1961.</p>
                        <p>(b) By making a grant aid contribution of $200 million spread over the 10-year period of the construction of the project. (On the part of the U.S. the Administration will actively seek Congressional approval of the funds required by the project.)</p>
                        <p>3. The U.S. and the U.K. should exert every effort to see that an agreement is reached between Egypt and the Sudan for a fair division of the Nile waters in a manner agreeable to the contracting parties.</p>
                        <p>4. The U.S. and the U.K. will inform the Egyptians that we do not believe that their proposal to negotiate an over-all contract with a consortium would be desirable. It is our view that a procedure involving competitive bidding of the type normally required by the International Bank would insure the most expeditious and economic execution of the project.</p>
                        <p>5. The <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> would give the Egyptian Government a letter of intent stating its willingness to proceed with the financing of the project subject to certain conditions which would be specified, including an agreement on the Nile waters. The <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> as a mark of its intent to move ahead with the financing would propose to Egypt the formation of a working group consisting of representatives of the Bank and Egypt to study financing and technical questions in connection with the construction of the dam.</p>
                        <p>6. In view of the magnitude of the undertaking and the great strains it will inevitably impose on the resources of Egypt, the Bank will make clear to the Egyptians that in order to mobilize the funds required and to maintain economic stability it will be essential to follow sound fiscal and monetary policies and establish firm priorities for development expenditures. The Government of Egypt would be expected to agree not to assume any other foreign debts which would impair its ability to discharge its obligation to the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>7. In return for the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> loan, and the U.S. and the U.K. assistance in meeting a substantial part of the foreign exchange requirements of the project, Egypt would be informed that she must finance the remaining costs of the dam out of Egyptian resources.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_820" n="820" facs="0848"/>
                        <p>8. The U.S. would inform Egypt that wherever possible the U.S. will continue to aid Egypt to improve its economy through a continuation of the mutual assistance program.<note n="2" xml:id="d433fn2">The Department of State on December 2 transmitted a summary of this policy paper to the Embassies in Cairo and London.

With respect to the prospects for an Arab-Israeli settlement, <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> believed that “they [the Arabs] are now ready to accept the fact that they will have to live with an Israel state.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.)</note> Deliver following message to <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> from Secretary:</p>
                        <p>“Dear <persName>Harold</persName>: I appreciate very much your message of November 19<note n="3" xml:id="d434fn3">See <ref target="#d416fn3">footnote 3, Document 416</ref>.</note> and also your first-hand account of the Baghdad Pact meeting with your impressions of the current atmosphere in the Near East. All the participants at the meeting are to be congratulated on the businesslike manner in which the new organization was launched.</p>
                        <p>“We certainly should not lose the impetus which has been developed. At the same time we need to keep in mind our present plans to make another try through Egypt towards an Arab-Israel settlement. I am encouraged by your assessment that the Arabs appear receptive to concrete moves towards a settlement and also by a report from <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> of a conversation with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> in which the latter endorsed <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName>’s encouraging remarks to our two Ambassadors.<note n="4" xml:id="d434fn4">See <ref target="#d428">Document 428</ref>.</note> Accordingly, I think that the next order of business should be another major effort to secure Egypt’s cooperation in moving towards <pb xml:id="pg_821" n="821" facs="0849"/>a settlement. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> is calling on me again on December 6<note n="5" xml:id="d434fn5">See <ref target="#d437">Document 437</ref>.</note> and I shall stress anew the essentiality of Israel making its contribution to a settlement.</p>
                        <p>“An immediate move to expand the Baghdad Pact would probably deny us <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s cooperation. Therefore, I think we should wait a little before trying to bring in Jordan and Lebanon. If we are not successful in Egypt, we should endeavor to secure the adherence of those two states as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>“US adherence to the Pact would probably have to be coupled with a security guarantee for Israel. My thought is that such a guarantee should not be extended prior to agreement on Israel’s permanent frontiers at least on the part of the northern Arab States. Otherwise, we would be giving up our strongest lever for use with Israel in obtaining a settlement.</p>
                        <p>“I was pleased that you mentioned the Buraimi incident as a matter of our mutual concern. I am disturbed by the possibility of this becoming another issue to be seized upon by nations in the area to attack the West and I believe a solution is urgently needed, possibly through a resumption of arbitration with an effective neutral supervisory commission in the zone of dispute,</p>

                        <p>576. <persName corresp="#p_HCC1">Herzog</persName> told me this morning that <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> had adopted a consistent position with Cabinet that solution to Egyptian threat was along lines of Israel arms procurement rather than preventive <pb xml:id="pg_822" n="822" facs="0850"/>action. <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> thought if enough arms could be obtained from West to offset “most” of Egypt’s Soviet arms, <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> in time would realize futility devotion his resources to munitions instead of to economic development. When I asked <persName corresp="#p_HCC1">Herzog</persName> whether Cabinet agreed with <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>’s position he replied: “I think so, but temper of people is such that if no arms are forthcoming things will be very serious indeed”.</p>
                        <p>In commenting to <persName corresp="#p_HCC1">Herzog</persName> re foregoing, I stressed the following:</p>
                        <p>1. Whether <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> in time loses interest in arms and arrives at “futility” conclusion depends in large part on Israel behavior pattern.</p>
                        <p>2. In my first few months in Israel relations with Egypt were relatively tranquil and <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> through <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> (Embassy telegram 212 August 30, 1954<note n="2" xml:id="d435fn2">For text, see <ref target="frus1952-54v09">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1952–1954, vol. IX</ref>, p. 1635.</note>) had stressed to <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> need for gradual and careful work, leading towards peaceful settlement.</p>
                        <p>3. Instead Israel had taken two measures which worked in opposite direction. Firstly Bat Galim test case was entirely unnecessary. It would be three or four years before any economic need send Israel flagships through Suez. In interim concentration should have been through diplomatic channels on clearing up problem getting Middle East oil through Suez in foreign bottoms.</p>
                        <p>4. Secondly, Israel defense force in summer 1954 for no good purpose had activated sabotage group in Egypt. Their activities had been very amateurish; agents had been apprehended; and once members Muslim Brotherhood had been executed by <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> it was inevitable that some of Jews would meet same fate.</p>
                        <p>5. Hanging Jewish spies and Bat Galim case (coupled with <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> revenge complex) had so inflamed Israel public opinion that Gaza incident followed shortly. This in turn had concentrated concern <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> and <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> on Israel threat and was largely, although not totally, responsible for Egyptian efforts obtain arms superiority.</p>
                        <p>6. It was ironical but of importance in determining future policy that <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> in efforts improve Israel’s security had stirred Egypt out of its military lethargy, thus creating additional insecurity for Israel.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HCC1">Herzog</persName>’s reply to foregoing was that “some people in Government” also attached importance to factors I mentioned but they also interpreted <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s recent behavior as being due to neutralism “found at Bandung” and his “dreams of empire”.</p>

                        <p>The Government of Israel has always upheld the necessity of a settlement with the neighboring Arab States.</p>
                        <p>2. It notes that the Secretary of State, in his Aide-Mémoire of November 21,<note n="2" xml:id="d436fn2">See <ref target="#d424">Document 424</ref>.</note> advocates an “approach which involves concessions by Arab states as well as Israel”. While the Israel Government believes that the legitimate interests of Israel and the Arab States are reconcilable as they stand, it holds that if concessions are to be made they must be based on equality and reciprocity. The Aide-Mémoire of November 21, however, discusses a territorial concession by Israel, without indicating the need for any specific territorial concession to be made by any Arab State.</p>
                        <p>3. If the Arab States prevent violence from their side of the demarcation line, Israel will maintain complete calm on its side. Israel’s policy is, also, to avoid reaction to provocation, except when such abstention imperils the security of its population or the integrity of its territory. The assistance of the United States would be welcomed in securing the cessation of “commando” raids and other violent actions now being carried out against Israel on various fronts, principally on Egypt’s responsibility.</p>
                        <p>4. Israel’s only intentions in the Gulf of Aqaba are those of free passage in conformity with its elementary rights under international law. If Egypt does not use force to impede passage in the Gulf, there is no reason to anticipate the use of force by Israel to ensure it. Moreover, if negotiations with Egypt prove feasible, Israel will abstain from any action in the Gulf likely to prejudice them.</p>
                        <p>5. The Government of Israel was interested to hear the view expressed by the Secretary of State on November 21, that there is now a chance of a settlement. Unfortunately, this impression is not borne out by the current acts and statements of Arab Governments. Encroachments continue into Israel, on the Egyptian, Syrian and Jordanian fronts. There is still no certainty of Arab acceptance of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>’s plan, which may well serve as a test of Arab sincerity. Arms from Soviet sources continue to flow into Egypt. In these circumstances, it is likely that the Egyptian regime is merely attempting to give an illusory impression of peaceful intent, in order <pb xml:id="pg_824" n="824" facs="0852"/>to gain time for strengthening its forces in preparation for intimidation or aggression when the time is ripe. At any rate, the Government of Israel is unaware of any concrete evidence which would disprove this analysis of Egyptian intentions.</p>
                        <p>6. Nevertheless, in order to assist the Secretary in his exploration, the Government of Israel submits its confidential views on the contribution which Israel might make in the context of a peace settlement. The settlement to which Israel aspires is one which would benefit both parties, by inaugurating an era of development and social progress; by enabling a reduction of defence expenditures; and by initiating processes of political, economic and cultural cooperation. Israel does not advance a claim to any of the territory held by Arab States under the General Armistice Agreements. On the other hand, Israel sees no reason for ceding any of its territory to any of the neighboring Arab States, and cannot see its way to discussing a settlement on such a prejudicial basis.</p>
                        <p>7. The following is the general outline of a settlement which Israel would envisage:</p>
                        <p>(i) The Government of Israel is ready to authorize a meeting at any appropriate level between its representatives and those of the Government of Egypt, to discuss progress towards a settlement, it being clearly understood that the basis for such a meeting would not include the cession of any part of Israel territory to a neighboring state.</p>
                        <p>(ii) Israel is prepared to discuss mutual adjustments of the armistice frontier for the benefit of both parties, on the understanding that the integrity and continuity of Israel’s territory is not impaired.</p>
                        <p>(iii) Israel would be willing, in the context of a peace settlement, to contribute substantially to the opening of freer communications between all the States of the Near East, so as to enhance the economic strength and commercial enterprise of the region, and promote political and cultural understanding. These measures, which would in each case be effected without change of the existing territorial jurisdiction, might include on Israel’s part:</p>
                        <p>(a) Provision for communication by air and railway between Egypt and Lebanon;</p>
                        <p>(b) Port facilities in Haifa for the Kingdom of Jordan, including transit rights by road to and from the Port;</p>
                        <p>(c) A transit arrangement to be agreed to by Israel for communication between Egypt and the Kingdom of Jordan, it being clearly understood that Israel will not cede territory, whether populated or unpopulated, in the Negev.</p>
                        <p>(iv) The Government of Israel recalls that it has already conveyed its affirmative attitude, subject to certain reservations, to the proposal on refugee compensation contained in Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ speech of August 26, 1955.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_825" n="825" facs="0853"/>
                        <p>(v) The United States is also aware of Israel’s readiness to cooperate in an agreed plan for the coordinated use of the Jordan and Yarmuk Rivers, as elaborated by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>. The Government of Israel would welcome information on the attitude of Arab Governments to this project.</p>
                        <p>8. The subjects proposed above for discussion and action represent a significant contribution by Israel to the establishment of peace with the Arab States. These States would, of course, have to make a corresponding contribution in order to ensure fair conditions for a peaceful settlement on the basis of mutuality. Thus, freedom of transit for Arab traffic between Egypt and Lebanon would entail corresponding freedom for Israeli traffic northwards over Lebanon and southward over Egypt. Similarly, if the Kingdom of Jordan is to have free access to and from Haifa and port facilities therein, it should agree to restore free access to the Wailing Wall, the Mount of Olives and Mount Scopus. Similarly, there should be a broad element of mutuality in any territorial adjustments agreed upon in accordance with Paragraph 2. Egypt should abstain from blockades and practices of maritime interception. Indeed, this duty is incumbent upon her under the Armistice Agreement, whether or not a settlement is achieved. In the context of a settlement such as that discussed here, all Governments should undertake to abstain from pressure and intimidation against governments or agencies wishing to trade with any state in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>9. In discussing the prospect of a peaceful settlement, the Government of Israel cannot ignore the prejudicial effects of the increasing preponderance of the Arab States, and especially of Egypt, in armed strength. Unless prompt steps are taken to reduce this perilous disparity, by providing Israel with additional arms for self-defence, such as would be matched in quality and effectiveness to the arms now obtained by Egypt, there will be an inevitable aggravation of Arab intransigeance and of Israel’s apprehensions. In such circumstances the Israel Government finds it difficult to conceive any hopeful discussion of progress towards peace.</p>

                        <p>The Israel Foreign Minister called at his request. He said that the Israel Government had given careful and searching thought to the aide-mémoire which the Secretary had handed to him on November 21<note n="2" xml:id="d437fn2">See <ref target="#d424">Document 424</ref>.</note> and to the remarks which the Secretary had made at that time.<note n="3" xml:id="d437fn3">See <ref target="#d421">Document 421</ref>.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> said that he had exchanged messages with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> and it could be assumed that the Prime Minister had consulted his principle colleagues in the Israel Government. He said that the Israel Government’s reactions have been incorporated in an aide-mémoire which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> handed to the Secretary.<note n="4" xml:id="d437fn4">
                                <hi rend="italic">Supra.</hi>
                            </note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> said that he had been deeply impressed by the Secretary’s statement in their last meeting that if there should unfortunately be head-long clashes requiring a decision on the part of the United States between supporting Israel and the Arab states, it is a foregone conclusion that the United States would support Israel. The Secretary commented that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> had over-simplified his remarks. He said the United States has repeatedly reaffirmed its position under the Tripartite Declaration of 1950 and, if a clash in the Middle East occurred through any aggression by Israel, it would be necessary for us to oppose it. What the Secretary had intended to say in the remarks Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> referred to was that if, despite all of our best efforts, a struggle developed in the Middle East between a Soviet-supported Arab world and a democratic Israel, our sympathy, at the very least, would be with Israel.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> said that he intended to speak seriously and frankly. He hoped the Secretary would also regard his remarks as friendly. The most vital and crucial interests of Israel are at stake. Israel wants <pb xml:id="pg_827" n="827" facs="0855"/>to differ as little as possible from the United States, but it was necessary to state Israel’s position clearly. First, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> said, he had been taken aback by the upsurging of a wave of optimism at the possibility of an early settlement. He had seen the wave rising in press reports from Cairo and later from Washington. The previous day a reporter had quoted Vice President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> as being optimistic. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> said he saw no change of heart in <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> nor any change in the provocatory activities along the borders. The Israel Government has had indirect contacts with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>, in part through American Jews traveling through Egypt, but none of the reports had been encouraging. In reply to a question from the Secretary, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> said that none of these contacts had been very recent. The most significant factor of all, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> said, was the Egyptian-Czech arms deal. With all Israel’s passionate desire for peace, it was necessary for the Israelis to exercise prudence in appraising the present situation. It does more harm to be unduly optimistic than to be healthily skeptical. Apart from an evaluation of the concrete prospects Israel is faced with, the Israel Government has noticed a certain departure, indicated in the speeches of the British Prime Minister at the Guild Hall and in Parliament and also in the suggestion by the Secretary that it may be inevitable for Israel to make territorial concessions to Egypt and possibly to others. There seemed to be a significant chronological sequence and the Israel Government could not help from believing that there had been cause and effect. It believes the new departure is the result of the Soviet-Egyptian arms deal. Before the deal, Israel had sought clarification of passages in the Secretary’s August 26 speech relating to boundaries. What the Israelis were told was reassuring. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> told Ambassador Elath that “nothing drastic” was contemplated, only “minor adjustments”. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> had gathered the same thing here in Washington. So Israel is forced to conclude that this insistence upon the indispensability of concessions is new and stems from the turn of events in Egypt. If this is so, then it is nothing less than a premium upon doing business with the Kremlin. The Israel public will regard the reported prospect of a loan to Egypt for the Aswan Dam as an additional premium. It will appear that if any country wants a loan or support for concessions the thing to do is to strike a deal with the Soviet Bloc. The Egyptian junta is getting the best of both worlds: arms from Russia, loans from the United States and the United Kingdom, and support for concessions from Israel. These public impressions will inevitably evoke the ghost of Munich. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> is out to gain time and to outwit both the West and Israel. What he wants would be at the expense of Israel’s security and ultimate survival. He is creating the impression of willingness to talk settlement in order to get the Aswan loan and also to gain time to absorb <pb xml:id="pg_828" n="828" facs="0856"/>his new arms and to achieve military confidence. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> said that he wished the crux of his remarks to be that there is no question of Israel agreeing to cede territory. It is essential to differentiate between adjustments which would be reciprocal, mutual, minor, and the result of give and take on the one hand, and cession of territory on the other. This is not a difference in degree but a difference in kind. What is now suggested is a cession of territory and that is not something that Israel can accept. Aside from a question of statesmanship, there would be no chance of such a cession being approved by the Israel Parliament or ratified by its electorate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> said he regarded <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s speech not only as a blunder but as a disaster. He said he was driven to the conclusion that <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> did it to improve Britain’s position with the Arab world. It was a “disaster” because it was bound to strengthen Arab intransigence. If <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> has Britain upholding his claims, why should he settle for any less? Since Israel will not concede, it makes the absence of a settlement a certainty. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> said that he believed the most charitable hypothesis is that <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> is committed to certain ruts of thought carried over from previous days. The Bernadotte Plan had carried a “Made in Britain” label. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> commented that <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s speeches had not earned him any support in the British press, with the sole exception of the <hi rend="italic">London Times</hi>. Most of the papers had been scathing in their attacks. The American press had also found the speeches revolting in their suggestion that Israel, which is so small, should give up land to the Arab states who already have so much.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> said that he wished to be constructive as well as critical and he hoped the aide-mémoire that he had handed the Secretary would be regarded in that light. If the Arabs want a settlement they should agree to the Jordan Valley Plan. It has been worked out on the concept of reciprocity. The Israel Government prefers to approach the question of a settlement through direct negotiation but it is not opposed in principle to mediation, as it has indicated by its cooperation with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>. But a mediator should not take up a position on a question such as the Negev in advance. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> had, therefore, disqualified himself as a mediator. The question for Israel is whether it can embark upon negotiations from a position of weakness while Egypt does so from strength. Does the United States believe it is wise or fair to begin negotiations at a time when <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> has planes and tanks in increasing quantities and when he knows that Israel has no definite prospect of getting them. Is not Israel’s claims for a similar number of weapons an irresistible one? Should Israel trust that nothing untoward will happen? For its part, Israel cannot put such trust in <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_829" n="829" facs="0857"/>
                        <p>With respect to the Secretary’s request on November 21 that Israel not force the issue of the Gulf of Aqaba at the present time, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> said that all Israel is doing is to use its own port. It is not encroaching on anyone. It is Egypt that has declared that it is going to use violence to prevent this use. What the United States is doing is asking Israel to submit to violence, to stay put, to submit to brutal force. There is, of course, always the question of political sagacity. If Israel were actually negotiating a settlement, it would not force the Aqaba issue. But unless and until negotiations begin or appear practical, Israel cannot renounce its elementary rights. It would be reducing its strength of negotiation. Israel, by renouncing its right to use its own port, would merely be giving additional strength to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s position. With what prospect would Israel be starting negotiations? It is being undermined at all points. This is not the general theory of the democracies in their efforts to cope with the Communist threat. The Secretary remarked that he did not believe the two situations were parallel.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> said that, as his last point, he wanted to suggest the advisability of concentrating on the <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> mission. This is concrete and tangible and on this issue <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> is on trial. He promised Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> that he would use his efforts to overcome the objections of Syria and other Arab states. Would it not be advisable to wait a couple of months and see if he carries out his pledge? Two years have been spent on the negotiations on the Jordan Valley Plan, which is a U.S. undertaking. If it succeeds, there will be grounds for encouragement. If it fails, then it will be necessary to strengthen Israel and wait for a better mood.</p>
                        <p>In comment upon Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>’s protest at the encouraging state of mind, he found in certain quarters about the prospects of a settlement, the Secretary said he had set forth his position in his press conference that morning.<note n="5" xml:id="d437fn5">For excerpts from the transcript of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ news conference of December 6, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, December 19, 1955, p. 1007.</note> He read the following from the transcript: “We continue to feel very strongly that there should be a solution of that problem. I can only go back in these matters to my comprehensive statement of August 26 on this subject, which was very thoroughly and carefully prepared, which emphasizes what we believe to be the imperative need of a solution to prevent, as I then said, the development of an arms race which would sap the economic strength of these countries. The gains to come out of a settlement from both sides are immense. We continue to hope that both sides will see the possibilities of such gains in the situation. I would not say that there are any concrete developments which could be adduced <pb xml:id="pg_830" n="830" facs="0858"/>as proof that they had been so convinced as yet. But the possibilities in our opinion still exist.”</p>
                        <p>With respect to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>’s point that the U.K. and possibly the U.S. had changed its position with respect to territorial adjustments and with respect to aid on the Aswan Dam as a result of the Egyptian-Czech arms deal, the Secretary said that such was not the case. As far as the U.S. is concerned, its views with respect to possible territorial adjustments had been in formulation for more than a year, ever since the Secretary had told <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> in the fall of 1954 that he was studying the question. The views we hold today are the same as those we had six months ago. The Secretary said that he had asked <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Francis Russell</persName> to work with him in seeing what the U.S. could do to help in making a settlement possible. He hoped that some day it would be possible for him to tell Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> or some of his colleagues more in detail what our views were. We have been studying the possibility of assisting in the construction of the Aswan Dam for over two years. Our attitude on what constitutes a fair agreement with respect to territorial adjustments and our attitude on economic development in the area has not altered as a result of the Soviet arms deal.</p>
                        <p>On the question of “cession” of territory in the Negev, the Secretary said that the Israel-Egyptian Armistice Agreement provides that the armistice lines were to be without prejudice to the question of ultimate boundary decisions. Israel’s present title to territory in that area is provisional, not final. The Secretary said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> had mentioned a lot of evil things that would flow from a willingness on the part of Israel to regard the Negev boundaries as negotiable: loss of access to Elat, loss of valuable mineral products, loss of population, and dismemberment of Israel. The Secretary said that he believes there are ways of avoiding this chamber of horrors and still provide land communication between Egypt and the rest of the Arab world. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> remarked that Israel had offered to provide a right of transit. The Secretary commented that that was not enough, in his best judgment, to obtain a settlement.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that, in his opinion, any possibility of a settlement must be carried forward by the mediation approach. He said we are not offering ourselves in that role but we are exploring simultaneously on both sides what the attitudes toward a settlement are. The Secretary said that he believes the time for a special effort at settlement is right here now. Today and for some months, the position of Israel will be one of military superiority. It will take time for Egypt to assimilate any arms it acquires. Egypt has always taken the position that it could not negotiate from weakness but it may feel that the prospect of an increase in its actual armed strength will suffice to enable it to contemplate a settlement. It is not probable <pb xml:id="pg_831" n="831" facs="0859"/>that we shall ever find a time of perfect equilibrium. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> said he must deny that Israel has military superiority. The Secretary said that all he could do was to take the advice of this Government’s military experts who believe that Israel has current military superiority. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> said that if Israel has superiority, it is the result of factors unrelated to equipment. The Secretary said it was quite true that this superiority may be less decisive in the future than it is now. The present is, therefore, a good opportunity to make a serious effort at a settlement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> said that the mood in Israel now is one of tense calm in the face of a grave danger. He pointed to the fact that there had been no recent reactions to border provocations because the public knows that the Government is attempting to deal with the larger danger. The Secretary said that he thought it doubtful that efforts by both sides to increase armaments would produce a better situation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he had only had an opportunity to read very hastily the aide-mémoire which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> had just handed to him but it was his impression that it was not adequately responsive to the Secretary’s requests of November 21. Nevertheless, it does indicate a certain willingness to negotiate. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> interpolated, “provided the cession of territory is not made the starting point.” The Secretary said that he had not suggested it as a starting point. The Secretary said that whatever merit there may be in Israel’s attitude toward the question of the use of the Gulf of Aqaba, it was necessary to bear in mind the practical fact which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> had mentioned, namely, that a raising of the issue<note n="6" xml:id="d437fn6">At this point in the text, the word “forcible” is inserted in Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ handwriting.</note> at this time would be most unfortunate with respect to the prospect of a settlement. The Secretary referred to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>’s suggestion that negotiations be delayed for a couple of months to see whether there might be agreement at the end of that time on the Jordan Valley Plan. The Secretary said that those two months are too valuable to spend in waiting. That may be the very time when a rough military equilibrium will best provide an opportunity for moving toward a settlement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> asked whether the impression his colleagues had obtained at the time of the Secretary’s speech last August that territorial adjustments would be mutual and not drastic was accurate. The Secretary said that <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Francis Russell</persName> had studied the problem intensively last spring and that, from a review of the situation with him, the Secretary’s impression had been that Israel would have less in terms of square miles but that it would not involve areas that were heavily populated or had great strategic value. With respect to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>’s <pb xml:id="pg_832" n="832" facs="0860"/>comment that it was one thing to negotiate and another thing to have a pre-judged plan, the Secretary said that he was not sure which category he would put our present thinking into. We have tried to satisfy ourselves that there is a solution that would not involve real loss to Israel but out of which would come some very real gains. The Secretary said that he believed there is a possibility of an equitable settlement and he hopes that Israel will not foreclose it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> said that he expected to be leaving the United States in a week and that it would be most important for him to have some indication of the United States’ answer to Israel’s request for arms. The Secretary said that the Department expected to receive from Defense by the end of this week a report with respect to availability and cost. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> said that what he would be most interested in would be not the details but a general understanding with respect to availability and especially the possibility of acquiring jet aircraft.</p>

                        <p>During the course of a call on the Secretary by Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger Makins</persName> about other matters, the Secretary mentioned that he had had an hour-and-a-half conversation with Israel Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> today.<note n="2" xml:id="d438fn2">See <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the general tenor of <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>’s remarks had not been good and that the latter had insisted that Israel could not give up any territory and could never enter into negotiations <pb xml:id="pg_833" n="833" facs="0861"/>committed in advance to territorial concessions. The Secretary said he had commented to <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> that it was not necessary to be committed in advance to territorial concessions and that what was important was the results achieved at the conclusion of negotiations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> had charged that the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had changed their position as a result of the Egyptian arms deal, to which the Secretary had replied that there had been no change in our position over the last six months and that if he were put on the stand he could produce documents and charts, drawn up long before the Egyptian arms deal, indicating that our position then was the same as it is now. Based on this position, he had made his statement on August 26, 1955 on our policy with respect to the Arab-Israel settlement.</p>
                        <p>Returning to <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>’s comments, the Secretary said <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> had insisted throughout the conversation that Israel could not give up any of its economic assets and could most certainly not give up access to the Port of Eilat, to which the Secretary had replied that we were not asking Israel to give up its economic assets or access to Eilat, but that there would have to be territorial adjustments and that when the negotiations were over, Israel would probably possess less square miles than before. However, this would be compensated, because what Israel might lose in territory it would gain in real security if a settlement were reached.</p>
                        <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger</persName> asked how <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> had reacted to this, and the Secretary replied that he had not reacted badly. However, <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> had taken the position that the present moment was inopportune to enter into negotiations and that it would be better to wait two or three months to see how the Egyptians reacted to <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Eric Johnston</persName>’s proposals with respect to the Jordan Waters. The Secretary had replied by saying we could not afford to waste time. In the next two or three months the Egyptians will not have assimilated the arms which they are receiving, and if progress towards a settlement could be made, it might head off an arms race and possibly keep the Soviet arms deal to a one-shot operation. If, on the other hand, we simply waited, the situation could deteriorate further, and therefore we believed it was essential to try to make progress now and not to lose two vital months. The Secretary added that <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> had indicated that when the time was ripe, Israel would be willing to negotiate either directly with the Arabs or through a mediator. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> had added, however, that <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> had disqualified himself as a mediator by reason of the recent position he had taken.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the Secretary said that while <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> had said many uncompromising things, the Secretary felt that there might be some give in the Israeli position. Therefore, his over-all reaction to his talk with <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> was not one of discouragement. He added that <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> had given him an aide-mémoire which he had not had time <pb xml:id="pg_834" n="834" facs="0862"/>to study.<note n="3" xml:id="d438fn3">
                                <ref target="#d436">Document 436</ref>.</note> Also, <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> had pressed him for a U.S. reply on the Israeli arms request, and it seemed probable that we would have to give this reply next week. Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger</persName> asked whether he had understood the Secretary correctly to say that the reply would have to be given next week. The Secretary replied in the affirmative and said that actually the Department of Defense had staffed the Israeli arms request, and although he had not seen the Defense paper since he had asked that it not be sent him until after his talk today with <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>, he understood that most of the arms requested were available and that price tags had been put on them. The Secretary indicated that the nature of our reply would have to be studied very carefully but that he felt it would probably have to be given next week. He added that <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> had indicated he would be willing to remain on in the U.S. for a few extra days if this would enable him to receive the reply directly.</p>

However, <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName> gave no indication that Israelis might be prepared under any circumstances consider removal Kibbutz or police force.</p>

                        <p>I walked with the President from his living lodge to the lodge where the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting is held.<note n="2" xml:id="d442fn2">According to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ Appointment Book, the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting that day at Camp David began at 10 a.m. (Princeton University Library, Dulles Papers)</note> We discussed the question of arms to Israel. I said that we would probably have the Defense Department’s list on availability and costing within the next day or two, and we would then have to reach a policy decision.<note n="3" xml:id="d442fn3">In a memorandum, December 7, <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> informed the Secretary that the Department of Defense would be providing this data in the near future.

                        </p>
                        <p>I said that in general our thought was to concentrate on primarily defensive items, although the big problem would be the jet planes which, while essentially fighter and interceptor planes, could be used offensively to drop bombs.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed the view that we could not very well refuse to let the Israelis buy some defensive weapons.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out that I was looking into the question of whether we could limit the list to the same type of equipment which we were prepared to sell Egypt last June. This would at least in principle make our action less subject to criticism by the Arabs. Also, I hoped we could announce some program for Iraq and Saudi Arabia at the same time and possibly something about the Aswan Dam. However, I said that undoubtedly any sale of arms to Israel would be misinterpreted in the Arab world as support for Israel against her Arab neighbors and would have bad political repercussions, tending to drive the Arabs more and more into the arms of the Soviet Union.</p>

                        <p>At luncheon on December 8 at Camp David, President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, Secretary of the Treasury <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, and Dr. Howard Snyder, the President’s <pb xml:id="pg_838" n="838" facs="0866"/>personal physician, reviewed several matters, among them the problem of financing the Aswan Dam. On this subject, <persName>Dulles</persName> recorded the following:</p>
                        <p>“There then ensued some general conversation. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> expressed the view that if we went to Congress for specific authorization on a project like the Aswan Dam, it would probably be defeated on the grounds that it would ultimately increase agriculture production and also that every Congressman who wanted a dam for his district would press against giving a big dam to the Egyptians.</p>
                        <p>“I said that I did not think that Congressmen ought to be called upon to vote on specific projects which involved these difficulties for them but that the responsibility should be taken by the national administration and Congress merely asked for general authority. However, this needed to be such as to permit of supporting projects which had several years to run; only thus could we dependably support major projects which were of a character to catch the popular imagination and produce the psychological results we sought.</p>
                        <p>“The idea then developed that we might ask Congress for authority to use not more than 100 million dollars a year for 10 years for ‘soft’ local currency loans, subject, however, to appropriations to be made on an annual basis. This would be somewhat like the policy adopted to finance the Marshall Plan where there was an authorization for 4 or 5 years but with only annual appropriations.</p>
                        <p>“The net result of the proposal would be to enable the Administration to undertake long-term projects, aggregating in value one billion dollars.</p>
                        <p>“The President thought this was an interesting idea to be explored.” (Eisenhower Library, Dulles Papers, Meetings with the President)</p>

                        <p>584. At suggestion of Foreign Ministry yesterday afternoon I made what I thought was to be a courtesy call on Acting Foreign Minister. In an 80-minute conversation <persName corresp="#p_MGMG1">Myerson</persName> made following points:</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_839" n="839" facs="0867"/>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s recent protestations about wanting peace were designed to mislead western powers and were made to gain time.</p>
                        <p>2. His real intentions were set forth in his <hi rend="italic">New York Post</hi> interview (October 13) when he “declared war on international Jewry, especially American Jewry, as well as on Israel”.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s ultimate objective was destruction of Israel, but he might be planning to do this in stages by taking Negev first.</p>
                        <p>4. Could not understand Britain’s support of <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s objective to link up Egypt and Jordan. He was already engaged subversion in Jordan and territorial contiguity would hasten Egyptian takeover to Britain’s detriment.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_MGMG1">Myerson</persName> next said Soviet move into Egypt was directed at western powers; Soviets were not supplying arms to Egypt for purpose of destroying Israel but if in process Israel was destroyed Soviets would not mind. She added: “Who knows, if we had requested Soviet arms we might have received them, but we have made no such request.”</p>
                        <p>6. When I asked <persName corresp="#p_MGMG1">Myerson</persName> whether she was convinced that <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> would attack Israel when militarily strong enough, she replied that “there is not shadow of doubt in my mind.”</p>
                        <p>7. In reply to my question as to whether her views on <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> reflected doubt as to his desire for settlement or skepticism that he would honor an agreement <persName corresp="#p_MGMG1">Myerson</persName> replied “both”. Her subsequent remarks however were concentrated on latter aspect and she illustrated her views by referring to Suez settlement and subsequent “double cross” which <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had given United States.</p>
                        <p>8. When <persName corresp="#p_MGMG1">Myerson</persName> said that immediate problem was for Israel to get arms from west I replied this would be nothing better than stopgap and that our view which we shared with British was that definitive settlement was imperative.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: <persName corresp="#p_MGMG1">Myerson</persName>’s concentration on <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> with virtually no reference to Egypt or <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> is characteristic of current Israel public and governmental thinking which personalizes Egyptian-Israel relations as fight between <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> and Israel plus Diaspora.</p>
                        <p>In my judgment <persName corresp="#p_MGMG1">Myerson</persName>’s stated conviction <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> will attack when able represents her real belief; the overwhelming majority of Israelis share this view; and it constitutes one of most dangerous aspects of situation in months ahead.</p>

                        <p>(<persName>Burns</persName> explained to us that police in his view counter-balance personnel of <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> checkposts on Western side D/Z. He noted that special committee had not yet decided their status but he felt that principle of police in D/Z depended essentially on status Kibbutz which <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> has never decided. He speculated <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> might eventually have to decide status police but he had observed no enthusiasm for <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> consideration problem at present time.)</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Burns</persName> saw <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> again later same day. View <persName corresp="#p_AGAH1">Amer</persName>’s position <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> withdrew suggestions previously made re demarcation and checkpost. <persName>Burns</persName> clearly disappointed Egyptian position. He points out that by sticking to technicalities <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> in effect leaving Israelis in military occupation D/Z. <persName>Burns</persName> hopes situation will remain “fluid” and mentioned <persName corresp="#p_AGAH1">Amer</persName> had assured him Egyptian troops in region D/Z had strict orders hold fire unless attacked. However <persName>Burns</persName> fears Israelis may take advantage <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> “rejection” <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> proposals to try mark unilaterally Western side D/Z. <persName>Burns</persName> said he would forbid such action but is not hopeful Israelis will desist. In that event further clashes likely.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: Problem is that each side fears attack by other but neither for political reasons seems prepared grant free movement <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> observers in disturbed area. (<persName>Burns</persName> admitted Israelis still restricting movements of observers in Western front area to main roads, <pb xml:id="pg_841" n="841" facs="0869"/>although they are permitted move freely in D/Z. In return <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> prohibits movement observers in area west of D/Z.) This would appear best means solve problem which is essentially fear of both sides of concealed military build-up. Hope to see <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> within next few days and will endeavor persuade him reexamine <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> position. In meantime, hope Israelis can be persuaded not to go ahead with marking and to make some progress on observer movement in Western front area.</p>

Negev vital to Israel <pb xml:id="pg_843" n="843" facs="0871"/>and he unable to see why Western powers thought it necessary to foster Egyptian aspirations to Arab leadership by giving <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> slice of Negev. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> replied settlement might stand or fall over Negev. It should be possible reconcile opposing views of Israel and Egypt without impairing vital interest of either. Major question was whether Israel would agree that Negev problem is negotiable. Would be great tragedy if either side stated it not prepared even negotiate on subject. US convinced that if settlement is to be reached it must be worked out with Egypt and Egypt would not consider settlement unless some arrangements made regarding Negev.</p>

                        </dateline>
                        <p>DEAR MR. SECRETARY: On the eve of my departure for Israel I wish to thank you for the opportunities which I have had of exchanging ideas with you in such a frank and earnest spirit.</p>
                        <p>Since our last meeting I have given much thought to your views on an Arab-Israel settlement. In accordance with your suggestion after our talk on December 6,<note n="2" xml:id="d448fn2">See <ref target="#d437">Document 437</ref>.</note> we have remained in touch with the Department; and we have received, through Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName>, a more detailed account of your thinking on the eight main problems which arise in the consideration of a settlement.<note n="3" xml:id="d448fn3">See <ref target="#d446">Documents 446</ref> and <ref target="#d447">447</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>When I return home, my colleagues and I will carefully examine these ideas, which have clearly been formulated in a genuine desire to resolve the conflict. There are several points which invite comment, but in this letter I should like to dwell only on the two matters which cause us the greatest difficulty and anxiety.</p>
                        <p>The most acute of these is the territorial question. In the aide-mémoire of December 6<note n="4" xml:id="d448fn4">
                                <ref target="#d436">Document 436</ref>.</note> I reiterated our willingness, in the context of a peace settlement, to consider mutual adjustments of the present borders for the benefit of both parties. Such rectification would not involve substantial changes of territory; but they might bring about improved conditions of security and communication.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_845" n="845" facs="0873"/>
                        <p>We continue, however, to be deeply disturbed by the Department’s advocacy of a change in the Negev which would “provide an Arab area joining Egypt with the rest of the Arab world.”</p>
                        <p>In our conversations on November 21<note n="5" xml:id="d448fn5">See <ref target="#d421">Document 421</ref>.</note> and December 6, I outlined the reasons which prompt us to oppose the principle of unilateral territorial sacrifice, whether in the Negev or elsewhere. Our objection is all the stronger when we reflect on the purpose which this particular sacrifice is to serve. There is something wholly artificial about the idea of Arab inter-communication between one wilderness and another wilderness, across a part of Israel where no lateral communications exist or have ever existed. On December 6 I told you of my deep apprehension that in order to achieve this dubious purpose, which responds to no essential needs of the region, Israel would be called upon either to amputate itself, or to cut itself in two and find Elath severed from its main body. I also expressed the fear that such a change would impede vital development work. In reply, you indicated that you had none of these consequences in mind, and believed that a way could be found of avoiding them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> has since acquainted us with methods whereby it is proposed to reconcile Israel’s vital interests to maintain its territorial integrity and hold Elath with the assumed need for providing “an Arab area joining Egypt with the rest of the Arab world.” For example, he has described the idea of triangles of territory in the southern Negev, one to be ceded to Egypt, the other to Jordan, meeting at a point of intersection through which Israel’s communications would run. I understand that amongst the various solutions discussed this is considered the most favorable to Israel’s interests.</p>
                        <p>I must tell you in all candor that this kind of proposal does not allay any of our apprehensions.</p>
                        <p>(1) It involves a considerable cession of territory to two countries which have no right to expand beyond their present frontiers at Israel’s expense. (Indeed, they both gained territory beyond their 1947 positions as a result of their invasion of Israel and occupation of parts of former Palestine.)</p>
                        <p>(2) The Department seems to understand that Israel’s outlet to the sea at its own port of Elath is a vital national asset which Israel cannot be called upon to renounce. But under the proposal in question this vital asset would be left hanging at the end of a slender thread, which the Egyptians and the Jordanians would be in a position to snap at any moment from the scissor-like position which they would acquire. In the insecurity thus created, communication with Elath would be utterly precarious. Economic development at Elath, or in the parts of the Negev adjoining the Arab triangles, would be discouraged and, indeed, paralyzed by the proximity of these two wedges of foreign territory. Prospecting for <pb xml:id="pg_846" n="846" facs="0874"/>mineral and other resources would be a hopeless venture amidst such a medley of interlocking frontier lines. Thus, although the map might indicate that Israel would not technically be losing Elath, the actual consequences of the proposed arrangement would amount to its loss, and indeed, to the prevention of our effective control and development of a major part of the southern Negev.</p>
                        <p>(3) In an effort to get an immediate settlement, complications are created by this proposal which hold the seed of future conflicts. In this case, there is not even the prospect of a short-term settlement arising from such an unacceptable proposal. The whole arrangement is one which, if it existed under the Armistice, should be removed by a peace settlement. It is certainly not the function of a settlement to create new and dangerous sources of friction and clash.</p>
                        <p>(4) The suggested imbroglio of interlocking frontiers is unnecessary even in terms of the problem which it purports to solve. For this problem there is a simple and rational solution. I refer to our agreement to consider a transit arrangement across this part of Israel territory without affecting the existing territorial jurisdiction. Objective world opinion would surely regard such a solution as more just, more stable and more conducive to long-term peace than the explosive situation which would be created by the drawing of lines on a map, without adequate thought to their effect on everyday life in the region concerned, and on the fate of the assets which it contains.</p>
                        <p>In this connection I would again urge the fullest consideration for the proposals contained in paragraph 7 of our aide-mémoire of December 6. A settlement established on such principles of reciprocity would transform the situation in the Middle East beyond recognition, without imposing any sacrifice of national interest or honor on any of the parties concerned. It would thus meet the definition which you formulated on August 26. It is not usual for a country which has been subjected for eight years to attack, siege and other forms of implacable hostility to offer its adversaries such tangible advantages as those enumerated in our aide-mémoire. I fear, however, that dogmatic insistence on the need for “an Arab area joining Egypt with the rest of the Arab world” would thwart any prospect of settlement which might now exist or subsequently arise.</p>
                        <p>The second problem on which I desire to comment is that of Arab refugees. The welfare of the refugees themselves, the interests of the Arab countries, and the stability of the region all require a solution by resettlement in Arab lands. To such a solution Israel can contribute significantly by the payment of compensation; and by accepting Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName>’s project, under which the major portion of the waters of the Jordan and Yarmuk Rivers would be available to Arab States for new agricultural development.</p>
                        <p>The measures of inter-communication and economic cooperation outlined in our aide-mémoire of December 6 would also assist the refugees, by increasing the viability of the countries absorbing them, especially of Jordan where 500,000 refugees now live as citizens of <pb xml:id="pg_847" n="847" facs="0875"/>the Kingdom. You will also recall what we have done and are doing in releasing blocked accounts, reuniting separated families and resettling in Israel, at our own expense, tens of thousands of Arabs displaced by the vicissitudes of war. All this together proves that we neglect no opportunity of contributing to the solution of a problem which would never have arisen at all, but for the folly of Arab governments in attempting the violent destruction of our State.</p>
                        <p>I must, however, say in all frankness that I cannot envisage how an Israel Government, in addition to all these burdens and contributions, can undertake to settle tens of thousands of Arab families in Israel. The economic and financial difficulties are grave enough: but even they are overshadowed by political and security considerations of the most compelling character. We cannot forget that these people have for eight years been heavily indoctrinated by Arab governments with hatred of Israel and denial of its statehood. It would not be conducive to their welfare or to our security for them to be resettled in Israel. Indeed, the very logic which moves you to uphold resettlement in Arab lands as the best solution for the vast majority, applies with equally compelling force to the minority. It cannot seriously be argued, for example, that it is possible for the vast Arab countries to absorb, say, 750,000 refugees and impossible for them to absorb 800,000. If there is a resettlement scheme, these relatively small differences of dimension would not prejudice its feasibility. For Israel, on the other hand, an undertaking to resettle Arabs would be a political and human impossibility. Moreover, the mere holding out of a prospect of repatriation, even for a fraction of the total number, would strengthen the resistance of all refugees to any resettlement at all. I therefore hope that you may see your way to pursue your thinking on this problem to its final outcome, and advocate resettlement and compensation as its total solution.</p>
                        <p>I presume that we shall continue to discuss these matters through our diplomatic channels in the coming days and weeks.</p>
                        <p>I cannot conclude without reference to the main preoccupation now weighing on my mind. It is difficult for us, in the absence of tangible supporting evidence, to assume that we are on the verge of negotiations with Arab States genuinely desirous of a settlement. Even if negotiations were to begin, there is no assurance that they would end in agreement. In the meantime, arms from Soviet sources continue to reach Egypt, while no corresponding increase in defensive strength has yet been made available to Israel. It is inconceivable to us that any friendly country should desire Israel to face its hostile neighbors from a position of growing weakness and vulnerability.</p>
                        <p>It was therefore my strong hope—especially in the light of what I heard from you on December 6—that I might receive an affirmative <pb xml:id="pg_848" n="848" facs="0876"/>answer to our request for the sale of arms before my departure. This problem continues to dominate our thoughts and I earnestly hope that we may soon have news which will alleviate our anxious suspense.</p>
                        <p>On leaving American soil I should like again to thank you and the Department for the unfailing courtesy which I have encountered during my stay in the United States.</p>
                        <p>I am, dear Mr. Secretary,</p>

                        </dateline>
                        <p>A matter of major importance which may come to a head while I am away<note n="2" xml:id="d449fn2">According to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ Appointment Book, he left Washington on December 13 for Paris to attend meetings of the North Atlantic Council. (Princeton University Library, Dulles Papers)</note> is what we say to <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> about the Israelis’ request for arms.</p>
                        <p>I suggested to <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">George Allen</persName> that we might divide the list into two parts, namely, part one being items which are available for immediate delivery and item 2 matters which are not available for immediate delivery. The latter two include the tanks and planes which will only be available for delivery next year at various stages, beginning with the spring and running through several years.</p>
                        <p>The items available for immediate delivery are the less expensive items and items which are more distinctively of exclusive defensive use.</p>
                        <p>I am wondering whether, in view of the provision of the law and corresponding agreement with Israel that items shall not be used for aggression, we could not say to Israel that we will sell her now the presently available items which, broadly speaking, are not utilized before aggression, but that in view of the danger that there will be aggression, we are not prepared to commit ourselves now for the items which could be used for this purpose. We are, however, <pb xml:id="pg_849" n="849" facs="0877"/>prepared to start to put these items in a state of readiness subject to the condition that intervening events or the then situation do not create a presumption of reasonable danger that the items will if then delivered be used for aggressive purposes.</p>
                        <p>It is quite true that these items such as tanks and planes could also be used for defensive purposes. However, we believe that our 1950 Declaration gives Israel reasonable assurance against itself being the victim of aggression and that under these circumstances we must be very careful in the delivery of dual purpose weapons, i.e., weapons almost equally available either for offense or defense.</p>
                        <p>Another phase of this matter was raised by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName>, who suggested we might ask Congress to pass a resolution endorsing the 1950 policy statement and authorizing the President to implement it.</p>
                        <p>This is, I think, worth considering, although I have a notion that it would arouse very considerable Arab antagonisms.</p>

                        <p>I outlined to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> the United States Government’s willingness (subject to informal Congressional approval) to enter into an agreement to aid in building the Aswan Dam. It is <pb xml:id="pg_850" n="850" facs="0878"/>anticipated that an arrangement could be worked out along the following lines:</p>
                        <p>1. The US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would together make a grant aid contribution of $70 million to cover the foreign exchange cost of the first phase of the construction, estimated to require about four years. The Egyptians would put up $65 million for local expenditures, toward which the US could contribute about $20 million in P.L. 480 wheat.</p>
                        <p>2. The World Bank would supervise the first phase of the program as the agent for the expenditure of the US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> funds. During the first two years of the initial period, the Bank would proceed with plans and negotiations looking toward the financing of the second phase—the main dam and the electrical works.</p>
                        <p>3. The World Bank would give the Egyptians a letter of intent, stating its readiness to consider a loan of $200 to $250 million for the foreign exchange costs of the second phase, subject to the following points being worked out:</p>
                        <p>a. Agreement on division of the Nile waters with Sudan.</p>
                        <p>b. Agreement with Egypt on internal financing of the local costs and stabilization of the local economy.</p>
                        <p>c. Agreement for additional outside financing of foreign exchange costs (present estimate of Bank is $80 to $130 million, which must obviously be largely supplied by US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>).</p>
                        <p>4. The US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would advise Egypt that they would give “sympathetic and urgent consideration” to a long-term loan to help in financing the foreign exchange costs of the second phase over and above the World Bank loan. Decision would be dependent upon the satisfactory working out of details between Egypt and the Bank in (3) above.</p>
                        <p>5. After thorough consideration, the US finds that if Public Funds are to be used on either a grant aid or a loan basis, a direct negotiated contract with the Consortium is not feasible, and competitive bidding is required. The procedures normally employed by the World Bank would be satisfactory. Contrary to the opinion of the Egyptians, some of whom are strongly in favor of a closed deal with the Consortium, the Bank does not believe that competitive bidding will delay the project.</p>
                        <p>6. In order to make funds immediately available for the first phase, the US contribution would have to come out of current <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956 <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> appropriations. This will require application of at least $20 million out of the total of $30 million of funds programmed for Egyptian aid in the current year. The balance would have to come from contingency reserves, etc. It may even be necessary to draw on some of the funds scheduled for Egypt in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957. The Egyptians would have to understand this clearly at the outset. Furthermore, contrary to the desires of the Egyptians, we cannot guarantee what <pb xml:id="pg_851" n="851" facs="0879"/>the level of grant aid programs might be in future years. These funds are authorized by Congress on a year-to-year basis, and there is no assurance that Congress will not take the large amount of appropriations devoted to the Aswan Dam project into consideration in determining such future authorizations.</p>
                        <p>7. A confidential agreement between the US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> as to their respective shares should be reached immediately, both for the first and second phases—the latter to be determined on a percentage basis inasmuch as the total amount is not yet firm.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> stated that, based on the original estimate of $40 million, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> was ready to put up $10 million. Now that the foreign exchange cost of the first phase has been determined to be $70 million, he doubted that his Government was prepared to maintain the 25% ratio. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> and I urged him strongly to do so, due to (a) difficulties we would certainly encounter in Congress, and (b) the added $20 million of wheat which we were contributing. He promised to obtain instructions on this point, as well as the percentage of participation by the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> in the second phase, by December 13.</p>
                        <p>We agreed to apply all possible speed in arriving at a decision in an attempt to give the Egyptians a firm proposal by December 16.</p>
                        <p>A working group was set up to prepare drafts of aide-mémoires,</p>

                        <p>1124. General tenor United States-Egyptian relations, including press treatment, on definite trend towards improvement. This believed largely due to present favorable publicity regarding forecast that United States will help on High Dam plus absence as yet of any word that United States may supply arms to Israel.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_852" n="852" facs="0880"/>
                        <p>It may be helpful for Department to have again in capsule form what we think would be results of furnishing Israel with substantial military equipment.</p>
                        <p>1. Israeli security would not be enhanced but perhaps more seriously threatened. Egypt sure to increase orders to Czechoslovakia. Probability of flow of Soviet arms, either through Egypt or directly to other Arab States, particularly Syria and perhaps Saudi Arabia would increase. Pressure on Iraq adopt “Arab” policy would be resumed.</p>
                        <p>2. As more arms are obtained from Soviet source, Arab feeling of gratitude for help of <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will become more pronounced. This in contrast to bitterness that will be thrown at United States, because <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> and other Arabs will be convinced it our policy try to keep Israel stronger than Egypt. This could reach point where United States lives and property would be in jeopardy.</p>
                        <p>3. Economic hold of Soviet bloc upon Egypt and perhaps other Arab States will be increased as result of further long range commitment Egyptian resources as per (1) above.</p>
                        <p>4. Good effects of United States assistance on High Dam will be completely over-balanced, at least in short run, by supply of military equipment to Israel. While from viewpoint development of Egypt and standard of living of people High Dam is essential, emotions involved in what Arabs view as immediate security problem would take precedence over probably more vital but much less dramatic long-range economic considerations.</p>
                        <p>Am certain Department will keep factors such as above in mind in facing up to extremely difficult decision that has been forced upon us.</p>

                        <p>597. When talking this morning to Tekoah, in charge armistice affairs Foreign Ministry, he gave me the same official version last night’s action against Syria as reported Embassy telegram 592.<note n="2" xml:id="d452fn2">Dated December 12; not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.)</note> I <pb xml:id="pg_853" n="853" facs="0881"/>replied that an action of this magnitude could not be planned and placed in operation over night; that the alleged incident had not been serious and that Lake Tiberias situation had been less troublesome this year than last. I did not accept the Israel explanation of last night’s aggression and doubted whether world opinion would. Tekoah then said that the action was more of a preventive than punitive nature. With the fishing season beginning it was necessary to teach the Syrians that they could not interfere with Israel activities on the lake. I replied that opinion abroad would regard the action taken and casualties inflicted as disproportionate to the objective he had mentioned. In a subsequent conversation with <persName corresp="#p_HCC1">Herzog</persName> I reminded him of our talk last week when I ventured the opinion that the worst thing Israel could do at this juncture was to stir up trouble with any of its northern neighbors and he had expressed himself as being in full agreement with this view.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: Although the official <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> explanation is adequate to justify last night’s action to the Israel public, already conditioned by prolonged detention Israeli prisoners in Damascus (Embassy telegram 403<note n="3" xml:id="d452fn3">Dated October 24, not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 683.84A/10–2455)</note>) and statement by <persName corresp="#p_AGAH1">Amer</persName> that Egypt and Syria ready to open war against Israel (Embassy telegram 559<note n="4" xml:id="d452fn4">In telegram 559, November 30, <persName corresp="#p_LEB1">Lawson</persName> catalogued a series of recent press despatches that had served to intensify Israeli concern with their “‘survival’ problem.” Among these was a statement attributed to <persName corresp="#p_AGAH1">Amer</persName> that “Egypt and Syria are ready to open wars of liberation against Israel moment public opinion in both countries demands it.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 784A.5/11–3055)</note>), it neither explains nor justifies timing or magnitude Israel operation. Coming on the eve of US decision re arms availability for Israel this operation is explicable only as (a) a first class Israel blunder or, (b) a decision by <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> “to <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> alone [<hi rend="italic">go it</hi>] alone” dealing with the Arabs. It is known that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> has been apprehensive about efforts to complete its encirclement by bringing Lebanon and possibly Jordan into network of alliances directed from Cairo (Embassy despatch 387<note n="5" xml:id="d452fn5">In despatch 387, December 12, the Embassy in Tel Aviv informed the Department of State that on December 7 Israel’s government-controlled radio station, Kol Israel, broadcast a warning to Lebanon to avoid involvement with Syria in a military pact. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 780.5/12–1255)</note>).

                        <p>On December 13, the Representative of Syria informed the President of the Security Council of the Israeli attack on December 11–12 in the area east of Lake Tiberias and called for a meeting of the Security Council. (U.N. doc. <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>/3505)</p>
                        <p>The Chief of Staff of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization, in a report dated December 15 and in a supplementary statement dated December 30, observed that Israel had linked the Lake Tiberias attack with the shelling of Israeli fishing boats and their police escorts in the lake, but concluded that there was a striking disparity between the scale of retaliation and the provocation that the Israeli Government had cited. (U.N. doc. <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>/3516 and Add. 1, and Add. 1/Corr. 1)</p>
                        <p>The Security Council considered the Syrian complaint on December 16 and 22 and at six meetings between January 9 and 19, 1956. (U.N. docs. <gloss target="#t_SPV1">S/PV</gloss>. 707–715) On December 22, the Representative of Syria introduced a draft resolution in which the Security Council would: 1) condemn Israel for the “outrageous attack”; 2) decide that the attack constituted aggression under Article 39 of the United Nations Charter; 3) call upon Members to apply economic sanctions and to expel Israel from the United Nations; and 4) decide that Israel should pay adequate compensation. (U.N. doc. <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>/3519) On January 9, 1956, the Representative of the Soviet Union submitted amendments to replace paragraphs 2) and 3) with paragraphs calling upon Israel to take all necessary measures to prevent such actions and warning Israel that their recurrence would require the Security Council to consider the application of Article 39 of the Charter. (U.N. doc. <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>/3528)</p>
                        <p>On January 11, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States submitted a draft resolution, by which the Security Council would note that, according to the reports of the Chief of Staff of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization, the attack deliberately violated the provisions of the General Armistice Agreement, including those relating to the Demilitarized Zone. It would also <pb xml:id="pg_855" n="855" facs="0883"/>note that there had been interference by the Syrian authorities with Israeli activities on Lake Tiberias, in contravention of the Armistice Agreement. By the operative part of this draft resolution, the Security Council would: 1) remind Israel that it had already condemned military action in breach of the General Armistice Agreements and had called upon Israel to take effective measures to prevent such actions; 2) condemn the attack of December 11, 1955, as a flagrant violation of the cease-fire provisions of its resolution of July 15, 1948 (U.N. doc. <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>/902), of the terms of the Armistice Agreement, and of Israel’s obligations under the United Nations Charter; 3) express its grave concern at Israel’s failure to comply with its obligations; 4) call upon Israel to do so in the future, in default of which the Council would have to consider what further measures were required to maintain or restore peace; 5) call upon the parties to comply with their obligations under the terms of the General Armistice Agreement to respect the Armistice Demarcation Line and the Demilitarized Zone; 6) request the Chief of Staff to pursue suggestions for improving the situation in the area of Lake Tiberias; and 7) call upon both parties to cooperate with the Chief of Staff in this and all other respects, to carry out the provisions of the Armistice Agreement in good faith, and in particular to make full use of the Mixed Armistice Commission’s machinery in the interpretation and application of its provisions. (U.N. doc. <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>/3530 and Corr. 1)</p>
                        <p>On January 12, Iran proposed amendments to the three-power draft resolution that would: delete the reference in the preamble about Syrian interference on Lake Tiberias; replace paragraph 4) of the operative part with a paragraph declaring that such actions in the future would constitute a breach of the peace within the meaning of Article 39 requiring consideration by the Council of the measures provided for in Chapter VII; delete paragraph 5); and add a new paragraph requiring Israel to pay adequate compensation. (U.N. doc. <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>/3532)</p>
                        <p>The sponsors of the three-power draft resolution revised their text on January 17 and again on January 18. (U.N. docs. <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>/3530/Rev. 2 and <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>/3530/Rev. 3) New paragraphs were added whereby the Council would hold that Syrian interference with Israeli activities on Lake Tiberias in no way justified Israel’s action and call upon the parties to arrange with the Chief of Staff for an immediate exchange of all military prisoners.</p>
                        <p>On January 18, Yugoslavia submitted another draft resolution. According to it, the Security Council would: 1) condemn the attack of December 11–12, 1955; 2) call upon Israel to refrain from such military action in the future; 3) consider that Syria was entitled to compensation; and 4) request the Chief of Staff to take appropriate <pb xml:id="pg_856" n="856" facs="0884"/>steps for the release of prisoners taken in this action. (U.N. doc. <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>/3536)</p>
                        <p>The Security Council, by 8 votes to 2, with 1 abstention, decided to grant priority in voting to the revised three-power draft resolution of January 18. (U.N. doc. <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>/3530/Rev. 3) The Council unanimously adopted this measure on January 19. (U.N. doc. <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>/3538) The Council did not vote on the other draft resolutions.</p>

The U.S. was awaiting reports from the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in the latter regard.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said he would convey this to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>. He could understand the position of the U.S. in the situation which had been created. There still remained the fundamental problem of the imbalance which existed in the area. The problem of an Arab-Israel settlement still existed. He hoped the U.S. would not fail to carry out undertakings to bring effort to bear on these problems because of “sporadic outbreaks.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> pointed out that the timing of the incident in Syria could not possibly have been worse, even from the viewpoint of <pb xml:id="pg_857" n="857" facs="0885"/>Israel’s own national interests. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> admitted “off the record” that he had not read the news reports of the incident with enthusiasm.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> turned to the recent informal discussions between Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SR1">Shiloah</persName> concerning the elements of a peace settlement.<note n="2" xml:id="d454fn2">
                                <ref target="#d446">Documents 446</ref> and <ref target="#d447">447</ref>.</note> In a lengthy discussion, he made the following points: 1) the double triangle proposal, while attractive on the map, meant in effect the loss of the Southern Negev to Israel. This Israel could not accept. 2) Israel would be coming to us with a counter-proposal whereby Egypt would be given transit rights across the Negev, not on “suffrance” but as a result of “international statutory procedures.” 3) He made much of the fact Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">John Foster Dulles</persName>, as a member of the U.S. Delegation to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly in 1948, had, according to <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>, led the opposition to the Bernadotte proposals which would have confirmed Israel’s possession of Western Galilee in return for the grant of the Negev, from Beersheba southwards, to Jordan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> replied that while we would be glad to look at any counter-suggestion which the Israelis brought forward, his own best judgment was that such a proposal as the Israelis envisaged making would be inadequate to meet the need for a settlement. He mentioned recent news reports about two Algerian pilgrims being shot as they attempted, unknowingly, to walk across Israel territory en route home from the pilgrimage to Mecca. Incidents such as these would dramatize to the Arabs the need for land communications between the Arab states. He emphasized to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> that the U.S. was not putting forward suggestions regarding possible territorial adjustments in the Negev because we thought that such adjustments were in themselves good things. Our interest in the matter was in getting a settlement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> asked, on behalf of his Foreign Minister, how serious was Arab willingness to work toward a peace settlement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> said that the amount of time and discussion on the subject we had spent with Arab leaders about equalled the time we had spent with Israelis. The Secretary’s best estimate was that there was a sufficiently serious desire on both sides to work toward a settlement to justify an all-out effort, and that until the Syrian incident, the Secretary had felt that the next two or three weeks offered the best opportunity to do so.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> suggested that both he and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> tell the press, in case questions should be asked, that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>’s visit had been “for periodic consultation.” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> indicated assent.</p>

They had tried to keep press treatment such as to play down emotions but of course not belittle seriousness of attack.</p>

Following substance information conveyed orally by Actg <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> and supported by British Ambassador and <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName>:</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Begin summary</hi>: After careful study of how US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Governments, in conjunction <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>, might assist Egypt build Dam, we have now reached point in thinking which would render it useful to tell Egyptian officials how matters developing. British and US Governments expect within next few days to be prepared document offers in form aide-mémoire.<note n="3" xml:id="d457fn3">
                                <ref target="#d461">Document 461</ref>.</note> Third document will be given Egyptians by <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>,<note n="4" xml:id="d457fn4">The referenced document, “Draft of Proposed Letter from the President of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to the Prime Minister of Egypt,” is the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>’s letter of intent. (Department of State, Central Files, 874.2614/ 12–1655) For portions of the letter, see vol. XV, <ref target="#d457fn2">footnote 2</ref>, p. 1. According to a memorandum of December 19 from the Secretary of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to Under Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> handed this document to Kaissouni on December 17. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.)</note> the three communications being interrelated. We hope they will render it possible for Egypt to proceed with project. We do not yet have draft aide-mémoire, which we will discuss with Kaissouni before their delivery; however following is general outline main points of arrangement which we think it might be possible undertake:</p>
                        <p>A. Re first stage, US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would together make grant aid contributions to preliminary Dam works aggregating $70 million covering necessary foreign exchange costs. Understood that Egyptian <pb xml:id="pg_861" n="861" facs="0889"/>Government would put up remainder required for foreign exchange costs as well as for local costs this stage of project. Re local costs US might be in position provide additional assistance through utilization of substantial amounts Egyptian currency representing proceeds of sale to Egypt of wheat under P.L. 480. To extent such monies might be used burden upon Egyptian Government of raising local funds would of course be lessened.</p>
                        <p>B. Re second stage US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Governments would undertake cooperate with Egypt other Governments which might be interested and <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> by lending their further support toward execution of project. While not empowered to speak for <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> it our understanding that <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> is contemplating letter of intent stating its readiness consider loan to Egypt of up to $200 million for foreign exchange costs of second stage subject to there having been worked out satisfactorily such points as internal financing, agreement with Sudan on division of Nile Waters, stability of local economy and arrangements for additional outside financing which will be needed.</p>
                        <p>C. Certain aspects of mechanics of implementing project are of considerable importance within context of assistance from US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>:</p>
                        <p>(1) We will propose that disbursement of grant funds for first stage be handled by <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> on basis of criteria normally applicable to Bank’s own funds. In other words, from outset <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> would assume responsibility for handling foreign exchange provided for project by US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Governments.</p>
                        <p>(2) After thorough consideration <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> finds that if US public funds are to be used on either grant aid or loan basis, directly negotiated contract with consortium is not feasible. We aware of Egyptian desire to enter into such a negotiated contract, in belief that only this course would permit initiation of work on project in 1957. On basis our discussions with <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> however believe if procedures normally employed by Bank are used in this instance project will not be delayed. By following method of “invitational bidding” not only will legal difficulties relating to the American aid be overcome but we will avoid severe criticism which inevitably would follow any endeavor to make an American contribution on basis excluding competition. Our objection to negotiate contract is based on a principle and would not be overcome by for example adding American firm to consortium. Objection would be equally strong if American firm alone were being considered for contract. We have no objection to consortium as such and in fact consider it quite possible it will win contract under competitive bidding.</p>
                        <p>D. Again turning to question US grant assistance for stage one, in order make funds immediately available American contribution will necessarily come out of current <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 56 <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> appropriations. This contribution will far exceed <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 56 program which might have been undertaken in Egypt in absence of Dam project. Our going ahead with latter project will therefore have effect of reducing substantially other elements of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 56 Program for Egypt, although it is not expected that <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 55 program of which greatest part still unexpended <pb xml:id="pg_862" n="862" facs="0890"/>will be affected. Indeed latter funds should provide important support to Egyptian economy during calendar year 56.</p>
                        <p>E. Should be understood that in establishing magnitude economic programs for Egypt in subsequent fiscal years Congress undoubtedly will take into account sums committed by US to Dam project. Assistance to Egypt as well as to other countries provided for by annual Congressional action, and in calling these matters to attention Egyptian officials we not endeavoring to predict amounts that will in fact be available in future years. <hi rend="italic">End summary</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Egyptians expressed great appreciation this evidence US <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Bank desire help with project of such importance to Egypt, and main discussion centered around two points: a) whether US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> might be prepared now make firm commitment re assistance in phase 2 of project and b) requirement for competitive bidding.</p>
                        <p>While Egyptians seemed disappointed that firm phase 2 commitment could not be made, they were reasonably satisfied with explanation given. Re second point, however, Egyptians and particularly Hilmi urged strongly reconsideration so that negotiated contract can be given consortium. They expressed belief that delays which would inevitably accompany bidding for contract would result in postponement initiation of work beyond July 57, which is present target date. They suggested that in order avoid any criticism that US funds being spent for negotiated contract, Egypt would assume financial responsibility for consortium services (amounting approximately $23 million) with understanding full $70 million contributed by US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would be utilized under Bank procedures for purchases made on basis of competitive bids. Acting Secretary, British Ambassador and <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> undertook consider Egyptian suggestion, but made it clear it unlikely that US could agree proceed with project on this basis.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>: Believe US must insist on competitive bidding for contract although we hope that simple and expeditious means meeting this requirement can be devised. Department shares <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> view that bidding on “invitational” basis would be possible without causing undue difficulties or delays.</p>
                        <p>We will keep you informed of further developments.</p>

At meeting yesterday afternoon<note n="2" xml:id="d458fn2">See <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note> with Egyptian Delegation, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> of <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>, I verbally outlined details of proposed financing for project along lines my memorandum to you of December 12.<note n="3" xml:id="d458fn3">
                                <ref target="#d450">Document 450</ref>.</note> Egyptians appeared to welcome proposal warmly in all details except US requirement for competition in awarding contract. They reacted violently to suggestion that US public funds could not be used for purpose of a “negotiated” contract between Egypt and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-French-German combine of contractors claiming that such procedure would cause delay of at least a year in initiation of project. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> countered by stating that <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> did not believe any such delay would result.</p>
                        <p>Egyptians then proposed that they would pay for portion of contract embodying “fees and services” to consortium out of own funds amounting to $20 million on condition US would divert equivalent amount toward auxiliary irrigation aspects of project and thereby avoid direct expenditure of US funds on this item. Meeting adjourned with our promise to consider this proposal although I stated we were most doubtful this was a feasible solution, as it would be considered a subterfuge.</p>
                        <p>After the meeting <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> told me he already had instructions to make a strong démarche on US today in favor of negotiated contract with consortium. I explained to him that there would be violent reaction in Congress to such a procedure, especially where it involved payment of US public funds without competition to a British-French-German combine of contractors with a foreign government in which the US would have no opportunity to evaluate soundness or propriety of the deal. We were, furthermore, getting unfavorable impression of the Egyptians’ insistence on such procedure together with their refusal even to consider ways whereby competitive procedure could be expedited. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> firmly supports the US position regarding competitive procedure and has advised me privately he feels that our acquiescence in “negotiated” contract would have serious repercussions. It is his opinion and mine that Egyptians and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> will eventually agree to our position if we remain firm. There is not slightest question in my mind that Egyptians are <pb xml:id="pg_864" n="864" facs="0892"/>being strongly pressured by the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> in their present attitude of demanding a closed contract for the consortium.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> and others in Washington also feel we would be under great criticism by Congress and public generally if we acquiesced to such a proposal. You will remember <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> difficulties on grain elevator contract in Pakistan last year. I discussed the matter with Governor Adams and we are considering discussion with the President later this morning.<note n="4" xml:id="d458fn4">See <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>.</note> We do not doubt that <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> will again approach the President on behalf of the consortium.</p>
                        <p>I intend to continue a firm but courteous line on this aspect of the negotiations if you agree, and in such event I would appreciate your taking a parallel position with <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> in Paris. You may wish to discuss this matter with <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName>, both of whom I understand feel strongly on the subject.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_Tedul1">Tedul</gloss> 3. Re Aswan Dam. At Adams’ suggestion I forwarded copy of my <gloss target="#t_Tedul1">Tedul</gloss> 2<note n="2" xml:id="d459fn2">
                                <hi rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note> of this morning to President in Gettysburg. He called me by phone a few minutes ago, making the following points.</p>
                        <p>1. We cannot violate our basic procedures and customs of handling US Government funds by eliminating competition for the Aswan Dam contract, such as by awarding it to the consortium on a “negotiated” basis.</p>
                        <p>2. While we would be glad to see a US contractor included in the consortium, as proposed in <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s message to him of November 27,<note n="3" xml:id="d459fn3">
                                <ref target="#d429">Document 429</ref>.</note> that does not in itself satisfy the requirement of competitive procedures.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_865" n="865" facs="0893"/>
                        <p>3. He proposed that we draft a courteous but firm note from himself to <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> along the lines of (1) and (2) above so that there would be no misunderstanding of our position in the matter.<note n="4" xml:id="d459fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> prepared the draft of a message from <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> which encompassed the President’s recommendations and transmitted it to <persName>Dulles</persName>. (<gloss target="#t_Tedul1">Tedul</gloss> 4 to Paris, December 15; Department of State, Central Files, 874.2614/12–1555)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>I outlined to the President the normal procedures followed by the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> in calling for “invitational bids” from a few responsible contractors, which in this case would of course include the consortium, whether or not a US contractor was added to their partnership. The President expected that some US companies would have an opportunity to bid, although it was quite possible that the consortium, due to its familiarization with the project, would come in with the best bid. We could have no objection if this proved the case since competitive procedures would have been complied with.</p>
                        <p>He said he would appreciate your advice before actually despatching such a note to <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> in order to head off further opposition by the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>.<note n="5" xml:id="d459fn5">
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> subsequently advised against having the President send the proposed message to <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>, since it would “bring current conduct of foreign affairs into direct <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> channel. This would throw an intolerable burden upon the President.” Moreover, <persName>Dulles</persName> indicated “that <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> assume that there would have to be competitive bidding on invitation.” (<gloss target="#t_Dulte1">Dulte</gloss> 2 from Paris, December 16, <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> Conference Files: Lot 60 D 627, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 639)</note> Personally I think this action is desirable. While <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> gives every appearance of being fully cognizant of the problem, he is of course following <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s orders. As an alternative it has been suggested that if we were to advise <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> of the President’s position, this might do the trick, leaving the President’s message available if necessary.</p>

Each side claimed other fired first and it virtually impossible for <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> to establish responsibility. In chairman’s opinion, December 11 Israeli attack required minimum of one week’s planning and training by special troops. As pointed out in Tel Aviv’s 597 to Department,<note n="6" xml:id="d460fn6">
                                <ref target="#d452">Document 452</ref>.</note> it therefore appears December 10 exchange of fire, whether fortuitous or provoked by Israelis, provided excuse, not cause, for December 11 attack.</p>

                        <p>Tel Aviv Embassy is perhaps in best position appraise Israeli motives and timing of attack. Israeli action has wrought havoc on any plans for peace or tranquility in <gloss target="#t_NE1">NE</gloss> which involve willing Syrian cooperation. In this sense, Israeli attack served also as attack on the recent efforts of the President, the Secretary and British Prime Minister. The Department may wish to treat Israeli raid in this light.</p>
                        <p>Full repercussions here of December 11 attack cannot yet be appraised. Public emotions have been deeply stirred. Unless satisfaction can be obtained through <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or other processes, there is real danger present government may be faced with the choice of suicidal military action or of abdicating authority in favor of hot heads, largely left wing. Further Israeli attacks will increase this danger. Neither course will promote US interests in Syria or <gloss target="#t_NE1">NE</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Prodded by left-wing propagandists and encouraged by left-wingers and others in military and civil offices, many Syrians assume that US approves or acquieseces in Israeli violence, and they are unlikely to be disabused of such ideas without positive and firm action on US part.</p>
                        <p>Effect of attack on Syrian desire purchase US military vehicles unpredictable but in all probability conflict in Syrian army between leftists and groups relatively but only relatively favorable to West will be exacerbated. Embassy considers it fortunate that note offering sell vehicles was delivered to Syrian Prime Minister Saturday<note n="9" xml:id="d460fn9">December 10.</note> before shooting began on <gloss target="#t_SEA1">Sea</gloss> of Galilee.</p>
                        <p>When I called on Prime Minister Ghazzi December 14 to convey message contained in <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 436,<note n="10" xml:id="d460fn10">Dated December 13, not printed. (Department of State, Central Files, 684A.86/ 12–1355)</note> he referred to my conversation of the same day with Foreign Office Secretary General re Syrian protest to Security Council and said he hoped Syria could count on US support in Security Council. I replied I would transmit his request to Department.</p>
                        <p>In pursuance of declared aims of the President and the Secretary, and with view to (1) restoring measure of Syrian confidence in US, (2) assisting conservative elements in Syrian Government to resist left-wing pressures, and (3) convincing Israelis that sneak attacks are unprofitable, the Department may wish to consider (1) public statement in Washington condemning Israeli aggression, (2) full US support for unequivocal Security Council resolution condemning <pb xml:id="pg_868" n="868" facs="0896"/>Israeli attack (3) disapproval of sale of US arms to Israel and (4) effective reduction US bilateral aid to Israel.</p>
                        <p>Syrians are convinced more firmly than ever that any arms in Israeli hands are offensive arms. Should US now approve the proposed sale of arms to Israel, I believe the resentment here will be so profound that for all practical purposes Syria can thereafter be considered an unfriendly country, whether the Communists take over or not.</p>

                        <p>Project consists of a dam to be built across Nile about 4⅓ miles south of present Aswan dam; powerhouse at dam with initial installed capacity of 720,000 kilowatts which can later be doubled; transmission line to Cairo and necessary inter-connections; conversion of 700,000 acres from basin to perennial irrigation; and reclamation, irrigation, settlement of additional 1,300,000 acres, including provision of necessary roads and other public facilities. Dam will be 364 feet high and 3 1/10 miles long across crest. Reservoir will have storage capacity about 45,890,000 million cubic feet, sufficient to regulate Nile flow throughout year. Construction dam and initial power facilities, including transmission lines and connecting links, expected commence July 1957. Preparatory work will commence earlier.</p>
                        <p>First stage will take four to five years to complete. Total cost this stage estimated at $275 million of which equivalent $110 million <pb xml:id="pg_869" n="869" facs="0897"/>represents expenditures in foreign currencies. Work during this period will include (A) construction of diversion tunnels and permanent coffer dams, which will be incorporated in main dam, and consolidation and sealing of foundations of dam, and (B) relocation of population from reservoir area, conversion from basin to perennial irrigation of lands above-described, and irrigation facilities for about 500,000 new acres principally for food production in order meet needs of rapidly growing population.</p>

                        <p>614. <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> Director Streibert met Wednesday and Thursday<note n="2" xml:id="d462fn2">December 14 and 15.</note> with <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_HCC1">Herzog</persName> and Chargé were present at conversations. Principal points made by Streibert were:</p>
                        <p>1. As result his conversations Cairo he greatly impressed with possibilities for peace settlement. For first time an Arab country admitted existence of Israel as state through public statements made by Egyptian Government regarding <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s November 9 speech. Secondly, <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> had told him he interested in settlement; that <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s statement point from which matters could proceed and he prepared to discuss boundaries and compensation. Finally Streibert said in conversation Baghdad Nuri Said had also indicated this was good time for settlement.</p>
                        <p>2. He emphasized incidents such as Tiberias action put off peace and made its achievement more difficult. He pointed this up (with visible effect on <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName>) by describing funeral cortege, flowers on caskets and solemnity of crowds watching procession which he saw in Damascus.</p>
                        <p>3. Streibert added that some people in Arab States had doubts whether Israel really wanted peace and had suggested it interested in stirring up trouble to obtain funds from abroad.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName> in reply made following principal points:</p>
                        <p>1. Allegation to 3 was untrue. Israel wanted peace which apart from its intrinsic worth was essential to enable state to meet its two great problems of receiving immigrants and of integrating them into nation.</p>
                        <p>2. As regards 2 above <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName> restated traditional rationalization of doctrine of retaliation but avoided any reference to specific incident to which Streibert had alluded.</p>
                        <p>3. Larger part <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName>’s comments devoted to Streibert’s appraisal situation in Cairo. Firstly, he doubted whether <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> really wanted settlement. Israel had made numerous approaches beginning with Naguib and continuing throughout <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s regime with negative results. Referring to Sunday’s<note n="3" xml:id="d462fn3">December 11.</note> conversation with General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">Burns</persName> and Cairo radio reports <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName> gave as example Egyptian “rejection” <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Secretary General’s Nitzana proposals.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_872" n="872" facs="0900"/>
                        <p>“<persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> is smiling at the US but he doesn’t smile at Israel”. He, <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName>, had to take into account possibility of attack by Egyptians when they ready. His position was similar to <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s if Russia possessed atomic bomb but US did not. Would we under those circumstances believe peaceful remarks of <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>? <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName> said “we are deadly afraid”. <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> will have 200 Migs and 50 Ilyushin bombers. Egypt already has superiority in heavy equipment. Israel has slight superiority in quality of her men. All this means “I have to think of possibilities of our settlements (border) being destroyed, of tens of thousands of flower of our youth losing their lives and of Tel Aviv and Haifa being destroyed in half hour from air”. (<persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName> expressed doubt whether Egyptians would destroy Jerusalem mentioning holy places.) <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName> added “nevertheless I do not believe they could completely destroy us. We would fight too hard for them but results would be … “<note n="4" xml:id="d462fn4">Ellipsis in the source text.</note> (He then repeated statements above re destruction of cities, settlements and loss of youth.)</p>
                        <p>When Streibert inquired whether he could not rely on <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to prevent such an aggression <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName> replied he could not. In 1948 when the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> was not as divided as it is today not finger lifted to help Israel meet onslaught of six Arab armies. Furthermore damage would be done before any action could be taken.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName> turned to question peace settlement and said he prepared to talk with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> immediately. He proposed following specific steps:</p>
                        <p>1. Cease-fire by Egypt and Israel. <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName> undertook during week or so which <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would require to get reply from <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> to his proposal to abstain from retaliations even in face of provocation.</p>
                        <p>2. Strict observance of armistice agreement.</p>
                        <p>3. Once these prerequisites had been met discussions could commence. He was prepared to work for peace in stages.</p>
                        <p>4. He accepted agenda which <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> suggested to Streibert. He prepared to talk about compensation also about boundaries “on give and take basis”. <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName> several times used expression “give and take” relative to boundaries.</p>
                        <p>5. When Streibert mentioned <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s apparent condition re using <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s statement as starting point <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> free to interpret <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s statement as he wished; but he, <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName>, also free to place his own interpretation on it or to use any starting point he desired and that important thing was start talking.</p>
                        <p>When Streibert pointed out that direct conversations between <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName> probably impracticable at this moment <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName> said he had no objection in earlier stages of negotiation to use of intermediaries; he believed however that before negotiations <pb xml:id="pg_873" n="873" facs="0901"/>could really be productive direct talks would be necessary; but such direct talks if that stage reached could be held with some Israeli other than himself.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: In my judgment <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName>’s proposals mark some advance from similar overtures which he made in past. Firstly, on territorial question he has proceeded from “not an inch of territory” to “mutual minor border adjustments” to process of “give and take”. Checking my notes of conversation this morning with <persName corresp="#p_HCC1">Herzog</persName> he indicated his belief that <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName>’s position on territorial question been modified somewhat by his statement to Streibert.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, his undertaking to abstain from retaliatory actions against Egypt irrespective of provocation while given for only short period gives some evidence seriousness of purpose when considered relative to public mood here and political hazards which he would encounter in adhering to commitment should one or two Israelis lose their lives during next week along Egyptian border. Streibert and I undertook to transmit his proposals to US Government but gave him no assurance Department would transmit them to <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>.</p>
                        <p>I anticipate by Tuesday next<note n="5" xml:id="d462fn5">December 20.</note> Foreign Ministry will inquire whether <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> has received proposals and by end of next week will be pressing for his reply.<note n="6" xml:id="d462fn6">
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGTD1">White</persName> informed the Department of State on December 17 that “Streibert in discussions with <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName> was unaware subject matter Washington discussions Secretary–<persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_SR1">Shiloah</persName>,” and <persName corresp="#p_WGTD1">White</persName> said that he had not informed Streibert of these conversations.

Tripartite meeting at Quai d’Orsay December 15<note n="2" xml:id="d463fn2">According to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ Appointment Book, this meeting began at 6 p.m. (Princeton University Library, Dulles Papers)</note> opened by <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName>, who stressed gravity of problems in Middle East and necessity for common policy by three governments in that area. Following general review of Soviet methods of penetration in area by Secretary, discussion took place on following subjects:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Control of Arms to Middle East.</p>
                        <p>Secretary recalled agreement at Geneva 3 countries would cooperate on delivery of arms as between Israel and immediate neighbors.<note n="3" xml:id="d463fn3">See <ref target="#d404">Documents 404</ref> and <ref target="#d409">409</ref>.</note> Said US has received <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss> request for considerable quantity ($55 million) of arms, greater part for planes and tanks. US intends bring matter before Ambassadorial Committee. Said that Department has informed <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss> in view attack on Syria it does not wish decide on request now.<note n="4" xml:id="d463fn4">See <ref target="#d454">Document 454</ref>.</note> Under US legislation cannot sell to country carrying on acts of aggression. Although Israel has signed reimbursable aid agreement that it will not use arms for aggression, we must take into account its actions as well as its words. May decide sell $10 million of defensive type weapons and delay on remainder to see what <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss> area policies are.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Pinay</persName> said French Government being constantly pressed by <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss> to make deliveries of planes and found position very difficult. He stressed need for common policy respecting deliveries. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had held up delivery of Meteors and urged that plane deliveries to Israel be suspended until Ambassadorial Committee had been established and had had opportunity to consider problem. He pointed out that introduction of such new types of equipment as French Mystere would alter entire character of armaments situation in area and felt that this should be studied by Ambassadorial Committee before any decision taken. It was agreed by three Ministers that plan [<hi rend="italic">e</hi>?] deliveries to Israel should be suspended pending consideration by Ambassadorial Committee and that <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss> would be informed that cessation of deliveries had been made in light of Syrian incident. It was further agreed that existence of Ambassadorial Committee would be kept secret.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_875" n="875" facs="0903"/>
                        <p>French stressed difficulties caused in North Africa by illegal imports of light arms from Arab countries in area and urged that Ambassadorial Committee should have jurisdiction over such shipments. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> pointed out that problem of illicit arms traffic was different problem from that for which Ambassadorial Committee created, i.e., implementation of tripartite declaration to prevent arms race between Israel and Arab countries. Both Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> pointed out practical difficulty of three governments trying to control trade in small arms in view of number of other countries which manufacture such arms and highly organized illicit arms traffic. After lengthy discussion it was agreed to instruct Ambassadorial Committee to establish sub-committee to study problem.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Aswan Dam.</p>
                        <p>French raised this point, stating they were in dark as to exactly where matter stands. They had been informed that they would be given opportunity to participate but had no information as to what exact arrangements were. Therefore, found it difficult to consider financial aspects and how they might take part. Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> reviewed developments to date and present status of discussions in Washington. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> explained that British-French-German consortium had been unable arrange financing of project and that <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> procedures required competitive bidding. He said that it appears likely, however, that some form of invitational bidding can be devised which will exclude Iron Curtain countries. He thought consortium, which he hoped would be expanded to include American participation, would have excellent chance of getting contract. Massigli indicated that French desire to be associated with project for political reasons, i.e., relations with Egypt and Arab countries, and wished to obtain information in sufficient time to permit them to make decision on participation.</p>

At luncheon meeting this noon<note n="2" xml:id="d464fn2">According to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ Appointment Book, this luncheon meeting with <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> on December 15 began at 1:15 p.m. and adjourned at 2:15 p.m. (Princeton University Library, Dulles Papers)</note> Secretary told <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> of his recent meeting with <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d464fn3">
                                <ref target="#d437">Document 437</ref>.</note> Said he had planned tell <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> re <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss> arms request that U.S. prepared sell equipment Defense had reported as available, which came to about $10 million and was essentially defensive in nature, but that balance of <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss> request, including planes and tanks, not available for immediate delivery; that as to latter, would try to get ready for delivery but final decision would depend on conditions at time including any <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss> use of aggressive tactics. As result of Israel retaliatory raid on Syria past week, however, Department had informed <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> no decisions on arms request possible at this time.<note n="4" xml:id="d464fn4">
                                <ref target="#d454">Document 454</ref>.</note> Secretary said we will in any event discuss any proposed arms sales to area with Ambassadorial Committee. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said U.K. had agreed with <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss> to deliver Meteors around this time but will inform <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss> that it intends hold up delivery at least until <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> acts on Syrian complaint following last week’s <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> raid. Secretary said we had just been informed by French that they would like to sell to <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss> twelve Mystere 4–A planes which they would like take from 225 being produced under Off-Shore Procurement and which would have effect of delaying these planes for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> somewhat. Secretary said if anyone going to sell jet planes to Israel perhaps preferable have French do it. In any event should be taken up in Ambassadorial Committee,</p>
                        <p>With respect to possible Israel-Arab settlement Secretary said <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss> ambiguous re what it will do on question of Negev. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> had started out by saying <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss> would make no concessions but his final words had been <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss> not willing enter negotiations prepared to yield on issue but is prepared to have Negev on agenda for negotiations. Secretary said Israel is in desperate plight in long run and it may precipitate war hoping we will back them. Secretary referred to <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> suggestion we wait for two months to see whether <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> carried out promise to obtain Arab agreement on Jordan Valley plan. Secretary said he had told <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> that two months was too long to <pb xml:id="pg_877" n="877" facs="0905"/>wait. There will be two months of quasi-balance with <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss> having force in being and Egypt hope of favorable change in ratio of power. After that, one side or other may decide to attack.</p>
                        <p>Secretary said he had been visited on Saturday<note n="5" xml:id="d464fn5">December 10.</note> by group of Arab Ambassadors<note n="6" xml:id="d464fn6">According to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ Appointment Book, he and <persName corresp="#p_WF1">Fraser Wilkins</persName> met with the Arab Ambassadors on Monday, December 12, at 11:02 a.m. (Princeton University Library, Dulles Papers) <persName corresp="#p_WF1">Wilkins</persName>’ memorandum of this conversation, not printed, is in Department of State, Central Files, 611.86/12–1255.</note> and had informed them U.S. might give Israel some arms though not all it was asking for, pointing out we were selling arms to Syria, Saudi-Arabia and Iraq. Ambassadors made no particular protest. They urged U.S. not give special security treaty to Israel and Secretary had informed them we had no intention of doing so.</p>
                        <p>In response to <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>’s query as to next steps in obtaining Israel-Arab settlement, Secretary said probably desirable to work through present staffs for time being as essential to maintain secrecy; if we can obtain assent of two sides to negotiate, time may come when full-time mediator necessary.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said it appears then that immediate problem is obtaining <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss> willingness to discuss Negev; then we can approach <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> through our Ambassadors in Cairo; and thereafter decide how best handle negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Secretary expressed hope U.K. would contribute $20 million of $70 million which U.S.–U.K. must provide for preliminary construction on Aswan Dam. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said he had already wired U.K. Embassy in Washington stating U.K. would provide $15 million and thought matter could be worked out. Secretary said Aswan Dam important not only to meet Soviet efforts at penetration but also as anchor to windward re peace in area as Egypt could not have dam with war going on. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said French and Germans had offered to help in financing dam as they anxious to participate in construction and realize it would probably work out that countries that put up money will, in rough and ready way, get contracts.</p>
                        <p>Secretary said that problems in the Arabian Peninsula were causing us concern as of course they were U.K. also. We felt U.K. had been taking important actions without advance consultation with us and that two governments ought to work out some way of concerting action. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said U.S. and U.K. in close collaboration on many problems in Middle East and he is sure we can work out similar cooperation on these problems. We need joint appreciation of situation, appraisal of our assets and sources of strength in area and decisions on how best use them. Among assets is U.K. position in Persian Gulf. Arab leaders in Gulf area must have <pb xml:id="pg_878" n="878" facs="0906"/>confidence in U.K. If not they will be prey to Communist efforts. If U.K. had not taken action in Buraimi it would have lost its influence in entire Gulf area. Secretary pointed out assets of West include U.S. position in Saudi Arabia which must be balanced against those of U.K. Secretary said important to have joint study group working on Middle East problems and attempting to work out joint position before <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> visit. <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_SCAE1">Shuckburgh</persName> could come to Washington in January.</p>

                        <p>632. Following comments are submitted in regard to Alpha project as set forth <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 411 to Tel Aviv:<note n="2" xml:id="d465fn2">Printed as <ref target="#d446">Document 446</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Proposals, with modifications, appear reasonable and to have some chance of acceptance by Israel after a period of direct or indirect negotiations extending over three or four years. Conclusion regarding time required is based on following:</p>
                        <p>(A) Negotiating experience with Israeli Government on many subjects past two years, including <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Johnston</persName> water plan, has convinced me that in cases where real concessions required, Israelis are … incapable of moving rapidly. In present case <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> is convinced that Arab objectives destructive and Arab tactics Machiavellian. This distrust compounded by traditional suspicion of <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> motives, already reflected in this exercise by virtual rejection of <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> as participating mediator. These suspicions were best exemplified by <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>’s own comment, inadvertently published, that <persName>Dulles</persName> proposal was a “mine field” (through which Israel must tread slowly and with extreme caution). Another strong characteristic of <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> in negotiations is propensity to remain adamant on a specific point until convinced that other party has made best offer. As <persName corresp="#p_JE1">Eric Johnston</persName> can testify this requires a lot of conviction.</p>
                        <p>(B) Second element in time period is present power framework within Israel. The Alpha proposals are of such a character that on each facet of the territorial and repatriation questions the Israeli <pb xml:id="pg_879" n="879" facs="0907"/>negotiators would be looking over one shoulder at the Israel defense force and over the other at the <gloss target="#t_HerutTenuatHaherut1">Herut</gloss> and General Zionist opposition, as well as at important militant elements in the <gloss target="#t_Mapai1">Mapai</gloss> and Achdut Avoda Government parties. Each proposed bolder adjustment from Metulla to Hebron would be minutely examined by the <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> to ascertain whether from military standpoint it increases or decreases Israel’s defensibility. In latter-type cases resistances to change would be great. Re refugee problem, each small increment in proposed repatriation quota beyond token reunion family level would result increased internal resistances on grounds economic liability and increased security (fifth column) crisis.</p>
                        <p>When Negev reached Israeli negotiators would be looking over both shoulders. If southernmost triangulation proposed, <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> would say Eilat becomes indefensible; if two double triangles, that area between the two likewise indefensible. Opposition groups would make most of emotional issue and <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would find itself, as it already dimly perceives, victim of its own propaganda.</p>
                        <p>2. Am convinced that present trends in this area are running so strongly against us that US Government cannot afford the luxury of the time period required to lead Israel to a settlement through the voluntary negotiation process now envisaged; and that long before agreement reached we would be faced with problem negotiation new armistice rather than a peace agreement.</p>
                        <p>3. Conclusion reached is that if there is to be a quick settlement, it must be of an imposed character.</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_ONE1">One</gloss> possible approach would be to maintain an arms embargo, particularly jet aircraft, on Israel until such time as Egyptian (and other Arab) acquisition and absorption Soviet (and Western) arms reaches point Israel required to make quick peace on any terms. Have explored this approach relative to current psychology here, making every effort distinguish what Israelis really believe from that which they want us to believe.</p>
                        <p>In my judgment, the Israelis have no intention of permitting situation to develop along lines set forth preceding paragraph. They are convinced they have their backs to the wall (or sea) and they will not hesitate to use every possible instrument at their command during the next few months when they believe they still retain some freedom of action.</p>
                        <p>Firstly, they are preparing greatest possible mobilization friends in the United States. While they recognize their leverage if President to be a candidate, they do not have same feeling in case prospect is for close election. Arms procurement to equate Soviet arms will be the issue raised and should it become complicated by outbreak hostilities in some form, prospects would be good for another “China controversy”.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, it is only two months since question was posed in Cabinet of (1) preventive action against Egypt or (2) arms procurement.<note n="3" xml:id="d465fn3">
                                <ref target="#d350">Document 350</ref>.</note>
                            <pb xml:id="pg_880" n="880" facs="0908"/>Department can draw its own conclusions what happens re latter approach rendered abortive by concurrence. Other Western powers in <persName corresp="#p_MHM1">Macmillan</persName>’s contention (<gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 8<note n="4" xml:id="d465fn4">
                                <ref target="#d463">Document 463</ref>.</note>) that plane deliveries to Israel should be suspended because introduction new types of equipment e.g. [garble] [Mystere 4–A?] (would alter character of armaments situation in area). I had assumed that alteration armament situation this area was already a fact, deriving from Soviet sales to Egypt MIG 15’s and jet bombers.</p>
                        <p>Finally, am unconvinced, in spite of <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s protestations to the contrary, that, if by some miracle we could hold Israelis in check, Egyptians could be relied on to exercise restraint once new weapons have created the necessary confidence in their officer corps.</p>
                        <p>5. Although present Alpha approach appears self-[garble—defeating?] because of time element and a settlement imposed by arms embargo impracticable, I do believe that an expeditious settlement is possible. This would require a framework of extraordinary collection of incentives and disincentives and a revised approach which, while requiring larger modifications basic Israel position than does Alpha, would be more acceptable to Israelis for reasons which I hope will become apparent on study suggestions to be transmitted subsequent telegram.<note n="5" xml:id="d465fn5">

With reference <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 633,<note n="2" xml:id="d466fn2">In telegram 635, December 22, the Embassy in Tel Aviv summarized Israeli press treatment of Minister of Labor <persName corresp="#p_MGMG1">Myerson</persName>’s speech on December 19 in New York in which she asserted that the British Ambassador had hinted to her that the United Kingdom hoped Israel would be willing to make territorial concessions in the Negev as part of a peace settlement. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 641.84A/12–2255)</note> British Ambassador has called on me to explain background <persName corresp="#p_MGMG1">Myerson</persName>’s comments in New York <pb xml:id="pg_881" n="881" facs="0909"/>concerning territorial concessions in the Negev. Nicholls said that he called on <persName corresp="#p_MGMG1">Myerson</persName> on November 23 (in her capacity as Acting Foreign Minister) to urge that the Israel Government abandon its adamant position on territorial adjustments. He told her that if real progress was to be made toward a settlement, Israel would have to be more realistic on the territorial question. When <persName corresp="#p_MGMG1">Myerson</persName> inquired as to what specific concessions he thought Israel should make, he answered that he did not know but would illustrate the principle. He asked whether Israel would reject a proposal that at a certain point Arab farmers on the Jordan side be united with their water supply a hundred meters inside Israel territory. When <persName corresp="#p_MGMG1">Myerson</persName> replied in the negative, the British Ambassador pointed out that if someone on the other hand demanded of Israel a transfer of land ten miles inside her territory it would obviously be rejected. Through this process a settlement of outstanding territorial problems might be reached.</p>
                        <p>Nicholls said that when the Foreign Ministry’s British desk officer, who was present at the meeting, brought to the British Embassy a draft of the memorandum of conversation, he was horrified to find himself quoted as urging the cession of a 200 meter strip of territory. He requested that the record be corrected.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: Although would agree that before real progress can be made settlement negotiations, it will be necessary for appropriate intermediaries to sit down with principal Israel political leaders, possibly the triumvirate of <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> and Eshkol, to discuss a well-conceived plan. I am most dubious that the British can serve effectively in this role. Some Israel leaders, such as <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben-Gurion</persName>, really believe that the United Kingdom wants a hold on a portion of the Negev either for airbases or for land connection between Akaba and Suez. Others, who do not go along with this thesis, are convinced the British position in the Arab world is so vital to them that their mediation would be subject to prejudice. The foregoing considerations probably account for <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>’s view that the United Kingdom had disqualified itself as a result of <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s address of November 9.</p>

                        <p>641. Following represents mosaic of events leading up to and following Tiberias action which I have put together from following sources (A) source personally and officially close to <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> (B) source officially close to <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> and (C) <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> general officer. Although to some extent their comments dealt with separate phases of developments to extent they overlapped there appeared to be no inconsistencies.</p>
                        <p>1. On Friday December 9 <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> met with Dayan and members of general staff in Tel Aviv to discuss steps to be taken to protect settlers during coming fishing season. Use of artillery to shell Syrian gun positions (this done last year) considered but rejected in part because civilian casualties would result. Plan provisionally adopted on that date a limited one and while directed at area in which action finally took place envisaged Syrian casualties and prisoners of same magnitude as earlier Syrian ambushes (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 403<note n="2" xml:id="d467fn2">See <ref target="#d452fn3">footnote 3, Document 452</ref>.</note>). (It will be noted this discussion and preliminary decision made December 9 one day before alleged shelling of Israel patrol boat given officially by <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> as action precipitating retaliation.)</p>
                        <p>2. On December 10 Chief of Staff Dayan went to <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> in Jerusalem and explained giving reasons therefore that plan authorized day before which based on limited Syrian casualties and avoidance civilian casualties dangerous one and would probably result in heavy Israel losses. <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> then authorized shift of plans to one put in operation following evening.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_MGMG1">Golda Myerson</persName> left for US morning of December 11. Some time between <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>’s first conference with <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> on December 9 and her departure December 11 he could have notified her of proposed operation in her capacity as Acting Foreign Minister and had she known she would have called in Eshkol and Aranne for consultation with <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> re advisability such operation in light its impact world opinion and effect on arms procurement negotiations. <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> however failed to consult any of his <gloss target="#t_Mapai1">Mapai</gloss> colleagues.</p>
                        <p>4. When <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> heard of Tiberias action he sent strong telegram to Foreign Ministry listing seven reasons why incident mistake. Three reasons given specifically to me were: Effect on Arab question <pb xml:id="pg_883" n="883" facs="0911"/>adverse impact on US public opinion and effect on British Parliamentary debate Middle East issues. Telegram referred to <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> who replied in personal letter to <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> setting forth his justification which along lines (A) invasion Arab territory no more horrendous than denying to Israelis use their own territory, and (B) necessary to assure to settlers their complete security.</p>
                        <p>5. On December 14 Minister of Religion Shapira (religious parties) in his capacity as Chairman convened meeting of Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee. Supported by Rosen (Progressive) and Ben Tov (<gloss target="#t_Mapam1">Mapam</gloss>) he took most critical line of Tiberias action claiming <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>’s decision unconstitutional because it had not been approved by his committee and stating he taking matter to Cabinet. Aranne (<gloss target="#t_Mapai1">Mapai</gloss>) out of embarrassment absented himself from meeting. Eshkol (<gloss target="#t_Mapai1">Mapai</gloss>) attended and out of party loyalty defended <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>’s action. <gloss target="#t_Mapai1">Mapai</gloss> Central Committee is to debate issue coming weekend.</p>
                        <p>6. Apparently <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> had some second thoughts because on December 16 he convened at Ministry of Defense <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> General Staff and all senior officers. At this meeting he laid down line that in next months (according to one version he said “two or three months” and according to another “three or four months”) it would be necessary for <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> to exercise uninterrupted restraint along border irrespective of difficulties of provocations. These months would be decisive in determining arms procurement and Israel’s future. When one officer asked “what do we do if we don’t get arms” <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> replied “we will deal with that barrier when we meet it”.<note n="3" xml:id="d467fn3">An apparent transcript of <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>’s address to the General Staff is in Department of State, <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> Files: Lot 59 D 518, Alpha—Memos, etc. during <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> talks: Dec. 11 to Feb. 15, 1956.</note> (Last week Congress-woman Frances Bolton at my suggestion asked <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> what would happen if Israel failed to get additional arms. She said he replied he would cross that bridge when he reached it.)</p>
                        <p>7. According to associates <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> returned to Israel more discouraged and depressed than outraged. With reference to Tiberias action he asked question: “How can I ever face <persName>Dulles</persName> again? He will either believe me guilty of duplicity; that I am not important enough to have been consulted; or my position so weak that having been consulted my advice rejected”.</p>

                        <p>Although possibly not factor in <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>’s Tiberias action decision have reason to believe that element in <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss>’s proposal for <pb xml:id="pg_884" n="884" facs="0912"/>action was Army’s unrelenting efforts obtain release their four soldiers imprisoned Damascus. It is basic moral tenet <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> that Army in no case will “let down” its soldiers. Furthermore recent letters to families indicate prisoners “cracking up” mentally.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Believe it reasonable assumption that, after period coyness and indecision, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> may indicate willingness to negotiate trade simple overpass or underpass land connection Jordan–Egypt for cession to Israel Gaza Strip without the refugees. Also may be willing accept repatriation very small number these refugees. Within framework present Alpha project doubt whether Israel prepared to go much further. Assume neither <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> nor US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would regard foregoing as satisfactory concessions. If so we could get fast and satisfactory performance out of Israelis only if we can come up with a revised program which they will view as a real answer to their security and economic problems. Firstly believe we should aim at a definitive final settlement between Israel and Egypt. With current judgments here re <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>, any program falling short of this will be regarded by Israel as no settlement at all. Secondly, believe territorial question should be aimed at creating maximum buffer of sand and stone between populations and armies two countries and elimination or reduction two prongs which extend along each other’s territory. Unlike present approach such an arrangement would effectively <pb xml:id="pg_886" n="886" facs="0914"/>reduce rather than increase defense problems two countries. Finally if we are going to offer Israel a way out of her disguised economic insolvency it can not be done by increasing her already heavy financial burden or by failing to make provision opening up nearby Arab markets. This would require US to raise its sights re financial participation and, as in case of territorial changes, objective of a complete rather than partial settlement between Israel and Egypt.</p>
                        <p>In pursuance foregoing suggest following possible modifications Alpha project:</p>
                        <p>2. Agreement by Israel to repatriate over a period of five years one-half Gaza refugees, i.e., 114,000 persons, with other half to be resettled Sinai project and elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>3. Israel–Egypt treaty of commerce and navigation with most-favored-nation provision (to contractually end blockade and boycott, primary and secondary).</p>
                        <p>4. Notification to Israel that present form of economic aid will end as of July 1, 1956.</p>
                        <p>5. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UJA1">UJA</gloss> to take policy decisions to spend in Israel next five years as much as they have spent past five; defined as average $60 million per annum for each.</p>
                        <p>6. Economic and development program concentrated on following:</p>
                        <p>(a) Completion Israel’s agricultural development through <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_UJA1">UJA</gloss> acceptance financial responsibility Israel segment unified water plan. This would require sum $30 million from <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> per annum for five years for reservoirs, Jordan power and diversion works, and primary and secondary canals, and a similar amount from <gloss target="#t_UJA1">UJA</gloss> for agricultural settlement i.e. agricultural equipment, tools, housing and land preparation. (Assume Israel’s own local currency expenditures would take care of secondary agricultural projects.)</p>
                        <p>(b) <gloss target="#t_UJA1">UJA</gloss> continued participation in moving existing settlements toward economic viability.</p>
                        <p>(c) <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> financing participation in developing mining and communications facilities in Negev areas remaining in Israel, possibly including roadstead and other facilities Gazokui Askel-on for potash and phosphate rock to compensate for loss of Eilat.</p>
                        <p>(d) Possibly <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> financial assistance to supplement reparation deliveries in completing Israel’s industrial plant.</p>
                        <p>7. US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> guarantee new boundaries.</p>
                        <p>While above approach raises sights regarding land concessions by Israel and in volume repatriation refugees by Israel, assume this is necessary because of considerations Arab side. It does have several overriding advantages from Israel’s standpoint: Names [<hi rend="italic">Means</hi>?] improved <pb xml:id="pg_887" n="887" facs="0915"/>defense; real hope of an economic solution; and above all a real rather than vague hope of peace. Larger absorption refugees and loss Eilat are two obstacles (largely psychological) which would have to be overcome in this country. Believe that after analysis Israelis will conclude refugees by thousands are less of a security threat with definitive settlement than by tens with a partial solution which, under current circumstances, would be regarded by Israelis as no settlement at all. Eilat problem will be viewed here in both economic and emotional terms. Its economic attractiveness is largely a mirage and could be neutralized by alternative program suggested. While I believe the foregoing has advantages which may offset emotional problem of Eilat … Israelis are so reluctant to make serious concessions that in my judgment settlement can only be brought about by clear and firm presentation of alternatives.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_ONE1">One</gloss> prong of the alternative would be the recommendation of notification that regular US economic aid will cease next year. The other prong is in the hands of the leaders of the <gloss target="#t_UJA1">UJA</gloss>. I recommend bypassing the professional Zionist leaders in the US, Nahum Goldmann et al, who by aptitude and disposition can exert pressures for but not on Israel. On other hand, the <gloss target="#t_UJA1">UJA</gloss> is an important and possibly decisive element in our ability to deal effectively with Israel in this matter. With bond revenues as well as regular donations in the hands of that organization the Israeli Government knows full well that, while it might stagger along without <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> aid, the <gloss target="#t_UJA1">UJA</gloss> is indispensable to Israel’s future existence.</p>
                        <p>Those <gloss target="#t_UJA1">UJA</gloss> leaders whom I have met, … impressed me … possibly, as having some reservations about where Israel’s political and economic policies will lead it. Suggest examination desirability <persName corresp="#p_WGTD1">White</persName> House call in key group of these leaders with a view to enlisting their assistance through detailed examination of problem and proposed solutions, as well as patriotic duties inherent in relationship Arab-Israel problem to threat to America’s entire position in the Middle East. Not only would Israelis listen carefully to them for financial reasons but they would view with less suspicion and more confidence people of their own religion who have amply demonstrated their interest in Israel’s survival.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LEB1">Lawson</persName> is returning to Tel Aviv this evening and may wish to transmit other or additional views this matter.</p>

                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Informing the British</hi>—I suggest that next Tuesday afternoon (January 3) after you have definite word from Bob Anderson that he will be able to leave in a week or so for the Middle East, you call <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger Makins</persName> and tell him that conversations that we have been having with both the Israelis and the Egyptians through various channels here and in the area, including your own talks with <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>, lead you to believe that it would be worthwhile to have someone of stature hold some conversations with <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>. You might say that we are doing everything we can to maintain it as a covert operation but that we will, of course, inform them from time to time how the talks are progressing and discuss with them any questions of area policy that arise. (In view of the British desire to direct the course of events in the Middle East and the lengths to which this has recently driven them, … I would be inclined not to go further with them at this time.)<note n="3" xml:id="d470fn3">According to a notation on the source text, which <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> initialed, <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName>, at the Secretary’s request, informed <persName corresp="#p_BRW1">Ronald Bailey</persName> of the British Embassy on January 3, 1956, of the contents of this paragraph.</note>

                            <persName>Anderson</persName> will, in any event, need a small staff of experts.

                        <p> “Dear Mr. Minister: I received your letter of December 12 just as I was departing for Paris. With regard to request of the Israel Government for purchase of arms in this country, which you mention, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> informed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> on December 13<note n="2" xml:id="d471fn2">See <ref target="#d454">Document 454</ref>.</note> that we were unable reach decision this time for number of reasons, prominent among them being recent incident on Syrian border.</p>
                        <p> “In your letter you also give Israel Government’s views with respect to some of questions involved in an Arab-Israel settlement. I hope the Israel Government will continue to give its most careful consideration to solution at this time of the various issues between Israel and her Arab neighbors. I am convinced that a resolution of this conflict would be of the greatest benefit to Israel and go far to remove a threat that otherwise must be of the gravest concern to all who are interested in its welfare.</p>
                        <p> “With kindest personal regards, sincerely yours, <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">John Foster Dulles</persName>.”</p>

                        <p>The Israel Ambassador called at his request and said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName> had received on December 23 the message (Tab A<note n="2" xml:id="d472fn2">The message stated, in part, that the “Secretary [of State] desires proceed rapidly and proposes that high-level special envoy be appointed to facilitate negotiations”. Additionally, “It is Secretary’s view that if the negotiations move sufficiently rapidly, then arms [for Israel] issue will fall into different pattern.” The message concluded: “Tentative inquiries addressed to N[asser] during the past few days give encouragement that he will be prepared to enter negotiations.”</note>) … and had just cabled to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> instructing him to give an affirmative reply. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> handed the Secretary a copy of <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharett</persName>’s message (Tab B<note n="3" xml:id="d472fn3">The message said, in part, that “it would appear that N.[asser] has not yet given a definite reply to inquiries on his readiness to meet. We [Israel] should like to have his clear answer without delay.” Moreover, “B[en] G[urion] is willing to meet with N.[asser] to negotiate, without prior conditions… . We [Israel] are strongly interested in the earliest possible commencement of the negotiations and their swift conclusion.” The message also stated that “Any refusal to respond favorably to our November 16 request for arms would, in our view, constitute a serious danger to Israel’s very survival, and to the peace of the Middle East.”</note>).</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said that he wished to supplement the message with some oral remarks. He said that both the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister had asked him to express their appreciation for the effort that the United States Government was making to initiate negotiations and that if they were brought about it would be a historic achievement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said that the second sentence was the crux of the message.<note n="4" xml:id="d472fn4">The second sentence reads: “We should like to have his [<persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName>’s] clear answer without delay.”</note> The Israel Government hopes that there might be direct negotiations as soon as possible but, until it is possible, is willing to work through an intermediary. He said that the <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss> would hope that the intermediary would concentrate on bringing about a direct meeting of the heads of State and not on the substance of the various issues. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said that the Israel Government especially hoped that the envoy would not identify <pb xml:id="pg_891" n="891" facs="0919"/>himself with any special positions on matters of substance. Egypt could ask for anything and the Israel Government would respond. The negotiations, however, should begin free of substantive commitments. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said that with respect to the final paragraph of the message, on arms, there would be alarm in Israel if no arms arrived during the period of negotiations which might well take several months. It would be an invidious situation for Israel to face negotiations with a steadily weakening military position.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that while he agreed that the negotiations should commence free of substantive commitments, he was not sure that it would be possible to achieve any progress if the intermediary was not to help in developing an exchange of information on the substantive position of the two sides. Upon Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> interjecting that Ralph Bunche had always insisted that the parties had to win each other over and not to convince him, the Secretary said that he agreed that that would, of course, be the situation here but that the positions of the two sides would have to be developed through covert channels at least during the first stages. This was particularly true as <persName corresp="#p_NNNGA1">Nasser</persName> would have a dual task, speaking for himself and lining up the other Arab countries. The Secretary said he envisaged the negotiations as commencing with frank talks by the intermediary with the head of State first of one government and then the other in their own countries and then engaging in an effort to get agreement on the various principle issues. He would also have as one of his objectives bringing about a meeting of the two heads of State at some feasible time. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said he agreed.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stressed that it was important to take advantage of the present period prior to Egypt’s achieving any change in the ratio of military power. The Secretary said that he knows that Israel is counting on getting arms to off-set those which the Arabs are obtaining, or may obtain, from the Soviet Bloc but that he wanted to emphasize that in his opinion the time is past when Israel can count on over-matching, or even continuing to match, Arab capacity to get and absorb arms. The West is no longer the only source of arms for the Arabs. They appear to have an unlimited call on military equipment from the Soviet Bloc. Israel’s capacity to absorb arms cannot match that of 40 million Arabs. Israel must rely more than ever before upon the good will which would make available outside strength and not on its own strength alone. Given present Soviet policies in the area, Israel could not win an arms race nor could it find any security in such a race. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said that he agreed that Israel cannot rely exclusively on its own arms. Israel’s concurrence in this point of view had been demonstrated by its interest in a settlement and by its efforts to obtain a security guarantee from the United States. Israel, however, believes that its <pb xml:id="pg_892" n="892" facs="0920"/>greatest security would lie in a position half-way between attempting to keep up in an arms race and sitting back and doing nothing. It makes a difference whether the ratio of power is 5–1 or 3–1. The Secretary said that he was not sure that there was very much difference. He said that Israel will not be swept away unless, by appearing to be aggressive, it ties the hands of those who would help it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said that the trouble for Israel is that at present it has no assurance that it would get help and that it must, therefore, be in a position to carry the brunt of its own defense. He said, therefore, that he hoped the question of the U.S. making arms available to Israel was not closed. He said the French Government has agreed to release twelve Mysteres to Israel but because of the connection of French Mystere production with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> it had informed Israel that it would have to contact the United States. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> expressed the hope that the United States would approve the release of the Mysteres. The Secretary said that the question of arms would, of course, never be completely closed. We should in any event have to wait for the Security Council to act on the matter of the attack on Syria. With respect to the Mysteres, he assumed that it might involve questions of off-shore procurement and it might, therefore, be a matter for General <persName corresp="#p_GGAM1">Gruenther</persName>. He said that he thought that the fact should not be disguised that Israel’s peril has mounted in the last few months as a result of the new Soviet policies in the area. The critical question is how best to deal with Soviet efforts to exploit the Israel-Arab controversy. The Secretary said he was convinced it could not be met by supplying arms to Israel. The only real way of removing the threat and obtaining security is by settling the controversy itself.</p>

Telegram 650 from Tel Aviv, December 28, reported that the Foreign Ministry had told the Embassy that the purpose of the release was “to apprise Israel public of <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>’s unconditional acceptance of Secretary General’s proposals by contrast with Egypt’s persistent refusal.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 674.84A/12–2855)</note> possibly as warning signal of some kind, but does not take it too seriously for time being since earlier press statements paving way for Israeli “retaliation” attacks have been followed by action almost immediately.

                            <persName>Burns</persName> saw Eytan December 29 but discussion rather futile. Eytan insisted that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> has accepted “unconditionally” <gloss target="#t_UNSYG1">UNSYG</gloss> proposals for EL Auja although acceptance in fact always predicated on prior acceptance by <gloss target="#t_GOE1">GOE</gloss> of “cease-fire” and implementation Article VIII paragraph 3 <gloss target="#t_GAA1">GAA</gloss>

                                <ref target="#d439">Document 439</ref>.</note>). <persName>Burns</persName> suggestion that Eytan write him a letter confirming Israel’s “unconditional acceptance” terminated discussion this topic. <persName>Burns</persName> said that in view Israelis reiterated complaints about alleged Egyptian firing across Gaza D/<gloss target="#t_L1">L</gloss> he urged again upon Eytan advisability discontinuing motor patrols few meters from armistice line. He told Eytan he would like discuss this and other matters with <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>, but has not seen latter recently.</p>
                        <p>Referring his meeting with Gohar December 28, <persName>Burns</persName> said Gohar seemed more affable than formerly but had nothing very fundamental to say. Gohar stated that Egyptian position <gloss target="#t_UNSYG1">UNSYG</gloss> proposals unchanged. Egyptians not willing consider the matter further until after <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> had concluded consideration Israeli aggression <pb xml:id="pg_894" n="894" facs="0922"/>Lake Tiberias.

                            <persName>Burns</persName> said <gloss target="#t_UNSYG1">UNSYG</gloss> proposals have served purpose of giving him some concrete points to keep before parties, but he regards their usefulness as probably now slight. He expressed idea that it might be better for <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> to return to more broadly based theme of implementation provisions <gloss target="#t_GAA1">GAA</gloss> itself including freedom movement observers.</p>
