                <p>The publication <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi>
                    constitutes the official record of the foreign policy of the United States. The
                    volumes in the series include, subject to necessary security considerations, all
                    documents needed to give a comprehensive record of the major foreign policy
                    decisions of the United States together with appropriate materials concerning
                    the facts which contributed to the formulation of policies. Documents in the
                    files of the Department of State are supplemented by papers from other
                    government agencies involved in the formulation of foreign policy.</p>
                <p>The basic documentary diplomatic record printed in the volumes of the series <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> is edited by the
                    Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, Department of State. The
                    editing is guided by the principles of historical objectivity and in accordance
                    with the following official guidance first promulgated by Secretary of State
                    Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925.</p>
                <p>There may be no alteration of the text, no deletions without indicating where in
                    the text the deletion is made, and no omission of facts which were of major
                    importance in reaching a decision. Nothing may be omitted for the purpose of
                    concealing or glossing over what might be regarded by some as a defect of
                    policy. However, certain omissions of documents are permissible for the
                    following reasons: <list>

                            share concern expressed by Bangkok over explosive situation resulting
                            from reports <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops in Burma
                            contemplating further raids into Chinese Communist territory and hope
                            Department can and will make strong representations to National
                            Government, pointing out any nebulous and ephemeral advantages to be
                            gained by further raids into Yunnan wld be far out-weighed by danger
                            would probably ensue, not only to Burma but to whole western position in

                        <p>Of particular concern to Embassy is persistence of rumors that,
                            notwithstanding repeated denials by US authorities of official
                            complicity, US nationals continue to be involved in supplying these
                                <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> forces. Understood French have
                            already brought to Department’s attention their embarrassment over
                            practice of non-scheduled aircraft from Formosa, utilizing American
                            pilots, refueling in Indochina en route to Bangkok. Other reports
                            continue to flow in from Burma describing in detail alleged use of ports
                            in Thailand as staging areas for logistical support of <gloss

                            unaccompanied by US restraining action will continue to be
                            ineffective.</p>
                        <p>In addition to representations already understood to have been made to

                            it seems to me following aspect deserves most serious consideration.
                            Although mere presence <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> forces in
                            Burma and small-scale <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> raids from
                            Burma into Yunnan will not in themselves invite Chinese Communist
                            invasion of Burma, it would, of course, furnish ready-made pretext for
                            such an invasion. When Chinese Communists and strategy dictates an
                            invasion of <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>, it will be simple
                            matter for them find or invent justification. What is more important is
                            effect presence these forces on Asian nations. In case of Korea, fact
                            that fifty nations denounced North Korean aggression<note n="3"

                            welcome this excuse for failure to join western powers in denouncing

                            and extended the statement he had made in the comite. He said additional

                            believed from Formosa. Five helicopters had been seen dropping weapons
                            very recently. He stated that Formosa was assisting troops. Accepted
                            statement that no US aid was being given but said that Americans had
                            been seen and that he believed that supply was under direction of Gen

                        <p>Telegram 1541 of February 4 from the Embassy [<hi rend="italic"
                                >Legation</hi>] at Saigon to the Department concerns policy on aid
                            to Chinese Nationalist guerrillas on the Asian mainland. The purpose of
                            this despatch is to comment, with particular reference to this telegram,
                            on aspects of the problem which relate solely to <gloss target="#t_KMT1"
                                >KMT</gloss> troops in Burma. The Embassy does not believe that
                            helping these troops will serve American interests.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Burmese neutrality and amenability to
                                persuasion.</hi></p>
                        <p>For background, it is believed necessary first to review aspects of
                            Burma’s policy of neutrality and prospects of persuading the Burmese
                            Government to prepare for resistance to aggression and accept the <gloss
                                target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops as a potential source of
                            strength.</p>
                        <p>While it may be assumed that there is general agreement that we should
                            continue efforts to convince Asian nations that aggression can only be
                            stopped by united action and resistance there is perhaps incomplete
                            appreciation of the reality of Burma’s inability to defend itself and of
                            the effects of this weakness on the Burmese Government’s amenability to
                            persuasion. We cannot expect Burma to prepare to make a serious effort
                            to defend itself against an attack by Communist China. Nor can we expect
                            Burma to look to distant friends for help if Burma is invaded.</p>
                        <p>Burma knows that it cannot defend itself against a strong invading force.
                            It thinks that any close association with the more powerful countries of
                            the free world could not offer advantages to counterbalance the dangers
                            from the hostility the association would <pb n="13" xml:id="pg_13"
                                facs="0033"/>provoke in Peking. It believes its best hope of being
                            spared disaster lies in maintaining the friendliest possible relations
                            with Communist China. This is not a sentiment based on ideological
                            sympathies but a conviction founded on instinct to survive.</p>
                        <p>General Ne Win has twice informed our Army Attaché that Burma would fight
                            if invaded. The Embassy believes that there could be little better than
                            token resistance. If conquered, most Burmese would prefer to accommodate
                            themselves to the first invader, i.e., Communist China, than seek help
                            which would turn Burma into a battleground of foreign armies. Their
                            attitude is, of course, conditioned in part by Burma’s experience in
                            World War II. The Burmese feel they then were helpless victims of a
                            struggle that did not concern Burma and in which they had no say from
                            beginning to end. Now that Burma is independent the Burmese think they
                            may be able to avert counter-invasions if not an initial invasion.</p>
                        <p>If the United States does not propose to send armed forces to Burma in
                            the event of an invasion by Communist China and if both the United
                            States and the United Kingdom would be unable to give assurances in
                            advance that they can defend Burma’s independence even if Burma wants
                            them to, we must be realistic enough to recognize the validity of this
                            Burmese attitude, whether it is to our interest and we approve it or
                            not, and we must see if we cannot actually derive advantage from Burma’s
                            position of neutrality, even if it is only the negative one of keeping
                            Burma out of the Communist camp and making friends who will offer
                            resistance to Communism if a Communist government comes to power by
                            subversion or invasion.</p>
                        <p>It would undoubtedly be desirable to convince Burma to drop neutrality.
                            But what are the prospects of success of efforts to persuade Burma to do
                            so? Most officials in the Burmese Government and most of the people will
                            remain unwilling to regard our efforts at persuasion as genuinely
                            directed toward helping Burma as long as Burmese are in their present
                            frame of mind of suspecting that the United States is either tacitly
                            consenting to the activities of those who are supplying the <gloss
                                target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops in Burma by not acting to
                            prevent the Chinese Nationalist Government from directing and aiding
                            these troops and curbing General Li Mi or is covertly contributing to
                            the support and organization of these <gloss target="#t_KMT1"
                                >KMT</gloss> troops. Unless the United States Government can remove
                            these doubts and suspicions and gain the confidence of the Burmese in
                            our good faith and integrity, they will continue to regard all our
                            suggestions, requests, and programs in Burma with misgivings and
                            scrutinize them for hidden motives they assume must be there.</p>

                        <p>It is not unreasonable to suppose that until the belief that the United
                            States is unwilling to help end the trouble caused by <gloss

                            Governments and peoples in Asia will be assailed by the same doubts as
                            to the genuineness of our professions of desire to uphold the
                            sovereignty of independent countries and provide them with aid without
                            expectation of achieving a position of dominance in their internal
                            affairs. As pointed out by the Embassy in London such doubts in the
                            event of world war would most surely endanger the prospects of the
                            support which the United Nations and the United States would be entitled
                            to expect from Asian countries.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Potential usefulness of <gloss
                                    target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops in Burma.</hi></p>
                        <p>As regards the potential usefulness of the <gloss target="#t_KMT1"
                                >KMT</gloss> troops in Burma, the information in the hands of this
                            Embassy is scanty. On the basis of the piecemeal reports that the
                            Embassy has received, present indications are that the <gloss
                                target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops in Burma would provide a very
                            slender reed if indeed they would not turn out to be a handicap. If the
                            events of June and July 1951 are any indication there seems little
                            prospect that the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops in Burma
                            can move into Yunnan and conduct successful military operations against
                            the Communists. In June they moved into Yunnan and were driven back into
                            Burma. Fears that they would be pursued across the border into Burma by
                            Communist troops did not materialize but there is little assurance that
                            the same would be true if the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops
                            again cross into Yunnan and are defeated.</p>
                        <p>The manner in which the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops are
                            now regarded by the inhabitants of areas they control or have traversed
                            into Burma suggests they might prove a handicap rather than a help. The
                            Embassy is informed that they are not very different from bandits. There
                            has been more than one report that they have been smuggling gold and
                            trafficking in opium. They live and prey upon an agricultural
                            countryside which can ill afford to support them. According to comments
                            of the Foreign Minister and War Office officials over the past year
                            these <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops are a greater source of
                            trouble than the insurgents and efforts to keep them in check have meant
                            diversion of forces from insurgent areas. It is highly questionable
                            whether the United Nations could count on any military assistance or
                            disciplined cooperation from these soldiers. The Army Attaché concurs in
                            this view. That the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops had to

                            apparent means of livelihood does not alter the fact of their
                            lawlessness and defiance of authority. Their refusal to surrender cannot
                                <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0035"/>be justified by the claim
                            that they would be ill-treated in internment camps. It is by no means
                            certain that this would be the case.</p>

                        <p>In any case, if this Embassy were to make any suggestion to the Burmese
                            Government to the effect that these troops in Burma might be useful or
                            should be aided, even if it is possible that the troops could be useful
                            to Burma, the Burmese Government might well reject the idea with
                            vehemence and conclude that our past denials of official American aid to
                            the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops in Burma were attempts at
                            deception. Any step which has the effect of confirming suspicions of
                            Burmese of our official involvement will tend to move Burma from its
                            neutral stand in the direction of the Kremlin: the more so at this
                            particular time because of absence up to now, at least in Burmese eyes,
                            of any real evidence of aggressive intentions toward Burma on the part
                            of Communist China.</p>
                        <p>There seem to be two impressions which, if still held, this Embassy would
                            like to dissipate. One is that the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss>
                            troops receive the collaboration of local officials and the welcome of
                            the inhabitants of the area. The other is that the Burmese objections to
                            the presence of and aid to the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss>
                            troops arise merely from affronted susceptibilities.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy at Taipei in telegram 450 of October 3, 1951, to the
                            Department (repeated Rangoon as No. 3)<note n="1" xml:id="d11fn1">Not
                                printed.</note> reported that the Director of the East Asia
                            Department of the Chinese Government commented that Chinese Government
                            troops in Burma receive collaboration of local officials and the welcome
                            of the populace. There may have been an element of truth in this in the
                            beginning when the number of <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops
                            was small and the troops had funds to pay for food and services. But it
                            is not so now. If there is collaboration and welcome it is subservience
                            to superior force if one may credit reports of reactions of inhabitants
                            of the area east of the Salween from the Wa State south to Thailand. Any
                            initial tolerance of welcome has worn more than thin. It is not merely a
                            result of living off the land but of dislocations and disruption of
                            authority (<gloss target="#t_Embdes1">Embdes</gloss> 690 Feb 8,

                            handed attitude of General Li Mi and his troops. The Embassy has
                            received reliable reports that the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss>
                            troops have levied taxes in rice and money, built barracks and
                            constructed a landing field at Li Mi’s headquarters at Mong Hsat, and
                            are requiring inhabitants to obtain passes for travel through areas they
                            occupy.</p>

                        <p>As far as Burmese officials and the Burmese people are concerned the
                            presence of the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops in Burma, the
                            difficulties these troops create, and the outside aid the troops receive
                            have produced a reaction that is more serious than a case of wounded
                            susceptibilities. The Government is embarrassed by non-Communist
                            opposition groups which are able to use the difficulties caused by the
                                <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops to publicize the
                            Government’s weakness. The above-ground Communist Burma Workers and
                            Peasants Party for several months has repeated the charges that the
                            imperialists are helping the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops
                            and has used the rumors of American aid to these troops to the best
                            propaganda advantage. The Government believes these attacks weaken its
                            position and is apprehensive over the effectiveness of this propaganda
                            and the advantages which the Communists may derive from it. High
                            officials in Rangoon, the Police, the Army and the inhabitants of the
                            Shan State are incensed over the depredations of <gloss target="#t_KMT1"
                                >KMT</gloss> troops, the attempts of these troops to enlist
                            inhabitants, some of whom do so to acquire arms which they can sell
                            after they desert (<gloss target="#t_Embdes1">Embdes</gloss> 690
                            February 8, 1952), the dislocations to the economy of the districts they
                            operate in, and the defiance of existing authority. Since, rightly or
                            wrongly, the Burmese think the United States can induce the Chinese
                            Government at Formosa to stop helping these troops and order them to
                            surrender, their frustration, anger and fear are given some expression
                            in resentment at the United States. The more widespread this resentment
                            becomes and the longer it lasts the less likelihood there is of
                            achieving United States military as well as political objectives in
                            Burma.</p>
                        <p>The resentment does not necessarily mean that Burmese do not sympathize
                            with or understand our struggle against Communism. It does reveal that
                            the Burmese are not now in a frame of mind to welcome use of Burmese
                            soil for any sort of military operation against Communist China. About
                            six months ago General Ne Win had an informal conversation with Colonel
                            Davies, Army Attaché, in which the General said “I know you are not
                            waging war on China. You are fighting the Great Bear and I am for you.
                            But it is a dirty trick to do it on Burmese Soil.” A recent remark the
                            General made to the Assistant Army Attaché, Lieutenant Colonel McGowan,
                            showed that despite the denial of the Secretary of State he thinks the
                                <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops in Burma are receiving
                            such aid. The attitude of many Burmese Army officers has been noticeably
                            cool towards this Embassy. There seems little doubt that not only most
                            men in the Army but many officials and other Burmese still believe the
                            United States is helping these <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss>
                            troops. Without some solution of the problem itself and dissipation of

                                xml:id="pg_17" facs="0037"/>difficult to draw the best advantage
                            from the anti-Communist sentiment which exists although it is not
                            reflected in Burma’s policy of neutrality.</p>
                        <p>The Burmese regard the law defying <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss>
                            troops in Burma and the activities of those aiding them as a violation
                            of Burmese sovereignty. The Burmese may be wrong but they remain
                            convinced that if the Chinese Nationalist Government stopped aiding and
                            directing the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops in Burma many
                            of these troops would sooner or later give themselves over to the
                            authorities and surrender their arms. They believe the United States
                            Government can exert the influence on Taipei that is necessary to induce
                            the authorities there to take such action. General Ne Win wants the
                            troops to be removed from Burma. The Foreign Office sees surrender and
                            internment as the solution more likely to prove practicable.</p>
                        <p>If it should be decided that the policy of the United States should be to
                            aid the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops in Burma, we should
                            be ready to accept the consequences of real Burmese hostility toward the
                            United States and a consequent weakening of the position of the present
                            Burmese Government. To regain local prestige the Government might be
                            forced to terminate the economic aid program and veer from its neutral
                            path toward Peking and Moscow. It is not impossible that a pro-Communist
                            group would overthrow the present government. The usefulness of this
                            Embassy as anything more than a point of observation would presumably be
                            virtually ended.</p>
                        <p>The information and cultural programs of this Embassy would probably have
                            to be curtailed or eliminated. A continuation of efforts to convince
                            Burma of our friendly regard and desire to strengthen its independence
                            would probably be futile.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy believes that a solution of this problem which will convince
                            Asian Governments that the United States actively desires to uphold and
                            does not intend to infringe on sovereign rights of free nations in the
                            pursuit of its policies and its political and military objectives will
                            have greater political and military advantages than a policy of open or
                            covert aid to <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops on the soil of
                            Burma. Despite the obstacles, it is not impossible that such a solution
                            can be found. Internment in Burma under conditions to which the <gloss
                                target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops would not object and to which
                            they might be induced to agree in advance would seem the course most
                            likely to offer hope of success.</p>

                        <p>In the light of the prevailing belief among Burmese that circumstances

                            removed before the United States can expect the Burmese to welcome

                            external threat of Communism. Any suggestion from the United States that
                            the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops could be put to good use
                            if aided would confirm suspicions and give validity to the rumors of
                            past aid. There is little assurance that the <gloss target="#t_KMT1"
                                >KMT</gloss> troops in Burma could be of military value either to
                            the United States or to Burma. If the United States were to extend aid
                            to the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops in Burma a strongly
                            hostile reaction to the United States would follow and the Government,
                            if not replaced by a pro-Communist authority, would be forced to veer
                            from neutrality to a more pro-Communist course. To draw best advantage
                            from the established neutral policy of Burma and the anti-Communist
                            thinking of many influential Burmese, it will be better to satisfy the
                            Burmese that we fully respect their country’s independence than to
                            disregard scrupulous observance of Burma’s sovereignty by aiding <gloss

                            attempting in Burma. Best solution of Li problem wld be for troops to
                            infiltrate Yunnan mountains and set up small guerrilla bases which cld
                            be supplied from outside. Yunnanese shld be sufficiently disillusioned
                            with Commie control by now to welcome and assist troops properly trained
                            for collaboration with local population. Unless Li can do this he likely
                            to do more damage than good to cause of free world. Large-scale invasion

                        <p>A memorandum for Secretary Acheson by William S. J. McWilliams, Director
                            of the Executive Secretariat, March 3, listing subjects for the
                            Secretary’s discussion with President Truman that day, included the
                            following item, headed “Chinese Troops in Burma”: “The President spoke
                            to you last week about this matter. We have checked … and within the
                            Department. The only things we have uncovered are the piece in the black
                            book which you have read and a telegram from London which is at Tab D.
                            The Burma desk considers this as interesting information but not in any
                            sense conclusive.” (Secretary’s Memoranda of Conversations, lot 65 D
                            238) The reference to the black book is not clear; the <pb n="20"

                            Secretary Acheson which reads as follows: “Item No. 4. Chinese Troops in

                        <p>Reports conclude by saying there much talk this area of <gloss

                            assumed this is explanation for recent step-up in shipment of new

                        <p>Bajpai stated with great emphasis he accepted entirely our assurances US
                            Govt not directly involved any way and indeed anxious as Ind Govt find
                            practical means getting <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops out
                            of this explosive area.</p>
                        <p>But he pointed out Formosan Govt regardless our wishes seemed desirous
                            stirring up trouble and thus dragging US into adventures on Chinese
                            mainland which cld only result in all-out war with <gloss

                            involvement.</p>
                        <p>He stated there nothing inconsistent about his fears of what Chinese
                                <gloss target="#t_Natls1">Natl</gloss> Govt might be planning this

                            integrity but he felt strongly unless we took firm and effective
                            position with Formosan Govt situation may get beyond control.</p>
                        <p>I again told Bajpai we as anxious get <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss>
                            troops out as he, that we keenly aware dangers present situation
                            particularly in that <gloss target="#t_ChiCommie1">Chi Commies</gloss>
                            might look on situation as excuse for military action North Burma.</p>
                        <p>I asked him if he had any specific suggestions on course of action which
                            wld ease situation. Bajpai stated he had no particular answer to <gloss
                                target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troop problem but it clear his mind
                            they being supplied from Formosa and certainly we must have influence
                            with Formosan Govt.</p>
                        <p>We wld again like emphasize extreme explosiveness this situation. There
                            have been reports here informal, unofficial and perhaps unreliable from
                            visitors to Hong Kong and Formosa who state very dangerous situation
                            exists and that Formosan Govt wld not be above involving US in Chinese
                            war through this or any other means. … high US mil officers in Formosa
                            operating on their own initiative and in clear violation expressed US
                            Govt policy.</p>
                        <p>Since these rumors persist we believe some definite steps shld be taken
                            with <gloss target="#t_Chi1">Chi</gloss> Nationalist Govt to relieve
                            this problem and further to clarify our position. In spite Bajpai’s
                            politeness it obvious he believes we carry at least indirect
                            responsibility this situation.</p>

                                information, the Thai Government was not backing the Karens and was
                                more concerned with Thailand’s eastern border than with the
                                Thai-Burmese border. The Embassy questioned the advisability of
                                approaching the Foreign Office on a matter in which the United
                                States appeared to have only an indirect interest.

                        <p>I called on Prime Minister U Nu by appointment at 4 p.m. today. After the
                            usual preliminaries, I opened the conversation by telling the Prime
                            Minister that I had been present at the Martyrs Day rally of last
                            Saturday, and that I had the advantage of having U Tun Shein<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d21fn2">Permanent Secretary of the Burmese Foreign
                                Office.</note> sitting next to me, with the result that I was given
                            a <pb n="26" xml:id="pg_26" facs="0046"/>running translation of his
                            entire speech. I congratulated the Prime Minister on a very fine speech
                            which obviously was well received not only at the rally, but throughout
                            Burma.</p>
                        <p>After some further discussion of the rally, I told the Prime Minister
                            that I was most encouraged from what I had learned during my short time
                            in Burma, the situation appearing to be much better than I had been led
                            to anticipate by press reports not only in the United States but
                            elsewhere. The Prime Minister said that he felt Burma has a “bad press”
                            and that journalists who come here report only the bad side of the
                            picture and entirely disregard the good or progressive measures that are
                            being accomplished by the Government. When I made a reference to
                            possible similar misreporting in Burma of happenings in the United
                            States, the Prime Minister replied that in his opinion <gloss
                                target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> has done an excellent job in
                            acquainting the Burmese people with the true American attitude toward
                            Burma. I said that I was very gratified to learn this, as only today I
                            read a report of what the <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> people
                            were doing. This indicated to me that they are working very hard and
                            with a commendable sympathetic approach toward Burma and the Burmese
                            people. I commented that, fortunately, any assistance which we are
                            giving to Burma has no strings attached; on reconsideration, perhaps
                            there are two strings, (1) we must be assured that Burma wishes to
                            receive what aid we are able to give, and (2) such aid will assist in
                            bringing about a free, strong, and independent Burma. The Prime Minister
                            laughed and said that those are no strings and if they are, he would
                            gladly accept them.</p>
                        <p>The conversation then led on to the present insurgency in Burma. I
                            remarked that it was encouraging to know that the Burmese Government is
                            pushing its action against the insurgents during the rainy season, with
                            a view to continuing the pressure in the dry season when the backbone of
                            the insurgents might well be broken. The Prime Minister said that this
                            is so but that, unfortunately, the Government had also to consider the
                            welfare needs of the people, and that arms being so expensive it was
                            necessary to divide the budget to provide an army to fight the
                            insurgents and also to insure an improvement in the livelihood of the
                            people.</p>
                        <p>I asked the Prime Minister whether he was having difficulties in
                            obtaining arms through the British Services Mission. He recounted the
                            difficulties in the past but was very hopeful that Air Commodore
                                Ward,<note n="3" xml:id="d21fn3">Air Commodore E. L. S. Ward was
                                head of the British Services Mission in Burma.</note> upon his
                            return from London, would be able to meet the needs of the Burmese Armed
                            Forces. He said that Commodore Ward had gone to London especially to
                            place the urgent need for <pb n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0047"/>more
                            arms and support before the proper authorities in England. Should it
                            transpire that sufficient arms are not forthcoming, the Prime Minister
                            felt that it might be necessary to appeal to the United States for aid
                            in this regard. He stressed, however, that Burma would, of course pay
                            for any arms furnished to it: the difficulty would probably be in
                            obtaining a U.S. permit for exportation to Burma. In any event, the
                            Prime Minister said he would await the return of Air Commodore Ward to
                            learn what the prospects are and, if necessary, he would again raise
                            this subject with me at a later time.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister explained that even if the backbone of the insurgents
                            is broken, Burma would still not “be out of the woods”. He said that he
                            fears the probability that the insurgents, and particularly the
                            communist elements thereof, would flee into Communist China where they
                            would be furnished with new armament, regrouped and retrained, and would
                            probably re-enter Burma to begin a rebellion all over again. For this
                            reason he considers it essential that the Army be strengthened with
                            sufficient arms to meet any threats of this kind, particularly on the
                            China border.</p>
                        <p>A chance remark on my part regarding communist aggression in Korea led
                            the Prime Minister to say that if the United States had not taken prompt
                            action to send troops to Korea to stop the communist onslaught,
                            Southeast Asia, including Burma, would have fallen prey to communist
                            aggressors. He said that in June 1950, he and other Burmese leaders
                            greatly feared that Burma would of its own accord go communist. As an
                            example, he cited the breakoff of the <gloss target="#t_BWPP1"
                                >BWPP</gloss>, who, he said, split from the <gloss
                                target="#t_AFPFL1">AFPFL</gloss> in order to form a new party which
                            would be in a position to welcome the Chinese Communists when they
                            entered Burma. At that time he felt that it was nip-and-tuck between
                            Southeast Asia falling to the communists and the ability of the
                            Governments in Southeast Asia to survive.</p>
                        <p>The discussion led to international communism concerning which the Prime
                            Minister took an entirely realistic view. He said that the pipelines of
                            the national communist parties all lead to Moscow, and while he had no
                            cavil with the Soviet Communist Party if it were to limit its operations
                            to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">U.S.S.R.</gloss>, he hates the Burmese
                            Communists, who are stooges of Moscow and operate against the best
                            interests of their own country. He said with vehemence that local
                            communist parties which follow the orders of Moscow are unmoral,
                            dishonest gangs with which there can be no compromise.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister was interested in and seemed to have some familiarity
                            with my remarks concerning the French Communist Party and its shift in
                            tactics before, during, and after the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact.
                            He laughed and said that the example <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28"
                                facs="0048"/>which I had given well illustrates the abjectness of
                            local communist parties.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said he hoped I would travel in Burma in order to see
                            the peoples in outlying districts and specifically suggested that I
                            might wish to go to Lashio and the Shan States. I replied that I am most
                            anxious to do this and hoped that it would be possible at a later date.
                            He said that it would, but suggested that the best time for travel is
                            after the monsoon season.</p>
                        <p>On leaving, I told the Prime Minister that I hoped he would feel free to
                            call upon me at any time when he wished to discuss matters of mutual
                            concern. He said he would do so.</p>
                        <p>The entire interview was most cordial and the Prime Minister personally
                            accompanied me to my car.</p>

                                    >KMT</gloss> troops” throughout Burma and elsewhere in Southeast
                                Asia. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> troops in Burma’s
                            northeast frontier area has been an increasing problem to the Burmese
                            Government. For two years, at least, the conviction has been growing
                            that the United States could and should contribute to the solution of
                            this problem. This conviction developed into a series of charges,
                            supported by apparently strong circumstantial evidence, that the United
                            States was directly involved in aiding these troops on the Burma
                            border.</p>
                        <p>The natural trade routes supplying the Shan States where the <gloss
                                target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops have been based run southward
                            into Thailand. The Shan States have traditionally been a source of
                            opium. The <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> commanders soon become
                            involved in the opium trade with Thailand as a source of funds. Movement
                            of opium into Thailand, and of supplies north from Thailand has
                            proceeded with apparent tacit approval of the Thai authorities, probably
                            also with their connivance and to their profit. Involvement of Thai
                            authorities, and the activities of officials of the Chinese Embassy in
                            Bangkok on behalf of the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops in
                            Burma are common gossip in Bangkok. The visibility in Bangkok of the
                            Taiwan connection with the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss>’s in
                            Upper Burma led Burmese authorities repeatedly to approach the United
                            States Government with requests that pressure be brought on Taiwan to
                            remove the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops.</p>
                        <p>Any thought that the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops might
                            prove a valuable protection against possible Chinese Communist invasion
                            through Yunnan was eliminated when, in the Spring of 1951, a force of
                                <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss>’s made an excursion into Yunnan
                            and was effectively routed, retreating again into Burma. Evidence of
                            poor discipline, banditry, and division of loyalties among various
                            commanders have further reduced the apparent military value of the
                            troops and enhanced resentment against those responsible for the
                            problem.</p>

                        <p>While evidence of direct United States involvement in supporting the
                                <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops in Upper Burma remained
                            circumstantial, it was generally accepted to the extent that denials by
                            the American Secretary of State, the United States delegation to the
                            United Nations, and by the Charge d’Affaires of this Embassy, while
                            courteously received, were not believed. Observed air-drops of supplies
                            from four-motored planes, the rumored involvement of an American company
                            in Bangkok, a whiskey bottle discarded in Kengtung stamped “Clark
                            Field”, and persistent stories of a “Major Stewart” and another American
                            in Monghsat were added to the conviction, general in Southeast Asia,
                            that American policy is paramount in the decisions of the Chinese
                            Nationalist Government. Burmese approaches to the United States
                            Government in search of a solution were coupled with a scrupulous
                            avoidance of public statements or action which might adversely affect
                            United States prestige.</p>
                        <p>The opinion, generally held in Burma, that the <gloss target="#t_KMT1"
                                >KMT</gloss> troops will be able to remain in Upper Burma only as
                            long as the United States so desires, is an adverse factor in United
                            States-Burmese relations which tends to undermine and lessen the
                            favorable impact of United States policies and programs in Burma. It
                            would appear essential that increasingly cordial and friendly relations
                            between the United States and Burma be developed, especially as Burma is
                            rapidly becoming a healthy member of the Asian community. A solution of
                            the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> problem would therefore remove
                            one of the obstacles to this friendship.</p>
                        <p>It is known that Defense Minister U Ba Swe is presently contemplating a
                            large-scale evacuation of the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss>’s
                            through the port of Rangoon. There are difficulties in this procedure
                            which might prove insurmountable. An alternative would be the removal of
                            the officer groups, following which, those remaining would, in part, be
                            absorbed into the communities of the area which is ethnically not alien
                            to them. A portion might continue operating as smugglers or armed
                            bandits, in which event they would at a proper time be dealt with in a
                            police action mopping up internal lawlessness rather than by a military
                            campaign against Chinese nationalist troops directed and supplied from
                            outside Burma.</p>
                        <p>While unable at this time to formulate detailed steps for solution of
                            this problem, this Embassy suggests a number of criteria as a basis for
                            detailed planning. In any event, it is all too apparent that American
                            interests and prestige have been seriously affected by the presence of
                            the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops in Burma. In furtherance
                            of United States policy in Burma and Southeast Asia, it is clear that
                            urgent consideration of the problem is essential in order that a
                            solution might be speedily found. <hi rend="italic">End of

                        <p>[Here follows detailed discussion of the Embassy’s information concerning
                            the activities of the Nationalist troops in Burma; allegations and
                            rumors connecting them with the Governments of the Republic of China,
                            Thailand, and the United States; the impact of the situation on United
                            States relations with Burma; and the possibility of a solution of the
                            problem.]</p>

                            recommendations</hi></p>
                        <p>From the above, it will be apparent that in the Burmese mind a
                            considerable amount of blame for the presence of the <gloss
                                target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops in Burma attaches to the United
                            States. It is also evident that denials by American Government
                            representatives have to some extent had the opposite of the intended
                            effect, and that only a complete liquidation of the problem will rid
                            this Embassy and other American representatives in Southeast Asia and
                            elsewhere of a serious liability in their work of carrying out American
                            foreign policy in this part of the world.</p>
                        <p>Any solution of this problem in the implementation of which the United
                            States might take part, however, calls for extremely deft handling to
                            minimize the chances of our calling down upon ourselves the propaganda
                            wrath of our evil-wishers in the event that the attempted solution
                            should go awry. Insofar as our position in Burma is concerned, it would
                            appear preferable to leave the problem alone rather than attempt its
                            solution by inept measures.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding considerable thought which has been given to this
                            problem, the Embassy is unable at this time to formulate detailed
                            recommendations and steps which it feels would effectively solve the
                            problem. It is hoped, however, that the Department will find useful the
                            following suggested criteria and limitations within which detailed
                            planning might be worked out: <list>

                        <p>It should be abundantly clear that American prestige in Burma is vitally
                            affected at every turn to a greater or lesser degree by this problem. It
                            is the belief of this Embassy, a belief reinforced by the developments
                            here in the last six months, that Burma is one of the bright spots in
                            Southeast Asia. Despite statements of neutrality by Burmese leaders,
                            their actions to a growing degree have indicated that Burma is on the
                            side of the free world. We therefore believe that the United States
                            should attempt by every possible means to develop a positive policy to
                            aid Burma to maintain its independence and to achieve its political and
                            economic potentialities. In many ways American programs are helping
                            toward these goals, but as long as American words are disbelieved and
                            American motives are suspect, our programs can never approach full
                            effectiveness.</p>
                        <p>It being avowed American policy to aid Burma to become politically and
                            economically independent and strong, we feel that every effort must be
                            made to find a positive solution to the <gloss target="#t_KMT1"
                                >KMT</gloss> problem which, more than any other, impedes our

                        <p>During a visit to Formosa between October 30 and November 4, Assistant

                            files, but despatch 617 from Taipei, May 21, 1953, which summarizes
                            developments during the preceding 3 years regarding the Nationalist
                            troops in Burma, describes the portion of the conversation concerning
                            this subject as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Assistant Secretary Allison discussed the Li Mi question with
                                    President Chiang during the former’s visit to Formosa at the end
                                    of October 1952. The President brought the subject up with a
                                    request for aid for these troops, and appeared very much opposed
                                    to any plan for evacuating them. Mr. Allison expressed the view
                                    that whatever value these troops may have had in the past, it
                                    was apparent that they were now a liability to the
                                    anti-Communist cause and a disruptive factor in Southeast Asia,
                                    and that an effort should be made to withdraw them from Burma.
                                    President Chiang emphatically disagreed.” (690B.9321/5–2153)</p>

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops have been in the Burmese
                            Province of Kengtung since early 1949, and are now reported to be
                            extending their area of operations to the north and south of that
                            region. A portion of them was engaged in a highly unsuccessful operation
                            into Yunnan in 1951. Their potential usefulness for anti-Communist
                            activities has been demonstrated to be very slight, and is becoming less
                            and less as time goes on. At the same time they are in constant
                            communication with the Chinese Nationalist Government and with certain
                            elements in Thailand. This communication, involving the violation of the
                            Burmese frontier, results in the furnishing of arms, supplies and
                            leaders and consequently in strengthening the <gloss target="#t_KMT1"
                                >KMT</gloss> forces and in augmenting their power to injure the
                            Burmese Government and flout its authority. Moreover, the troops are
                            becoming more and more of a burden on the population of the localities
                            in question, where they live largely off the countryside.</p>
                        <p>Their presence thus constitutes a source of deep concern to the Burmese
                            and their Government, which finds them a real and pressing danger to the
                            political stability of the country and a constant invitation to Red
                            Chinese intervention. Frequent emphatic reports from Burma underscore
                            the political dynamite in the situation, and it is feared that public
                            pressure may force the Burmese army to undertake full-scale operations
                            against the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss>. Aside from the
                            unfortunate repercussions which such operations would bring about, the
                            Burmese armed forces have their hands full with their own native
                            insurgents and are in no position to move against the <gloss
                                target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops. It will be recalled that in the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly in Paris in 1951,
                            Vishinsky accused the United States of aiding the <gloss
                                target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops in Burma.</p>
                        <p>For two years, at least, the conviction has been growing in Burma that
                            the United States could and should contribute to the solution of the
                            problem, and the Burmese authorities have repeatedly approached our
                            Embassy in Rangoon with requests that pressure be brought upon the
                            Taipei Government to cease supplying the troops and to order them to
                            leave Burma. There has been a good deal of talk in the Burmese press and
                            elsewhere concerning alleged support of the <gloss target="#t_KMT1"
                                >KMT</gloss> activities by U.S. citizens, unofficial and otherwise.
                            As Ambassador Sebald in Rangoon has pointed out, the Burmese press
                            continues to cloud every expression of U.S.-Burmese friendship with
                            references to the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> problem and
                            questions as to why the U.S. does not help to solve it. The pressure of
                            Burmese opinion, official and public, is becoming almost unbearable in
                            this respect.</p>

                        <p>When Deputy Secretary of Defense Foster recently called on the Burmese
                            Defense Minister Ba Swe,<note n="2" xml:id="d28fn2">Deputy Secretary of
                                Defense William C. Foster visited Rangoon in the course of a trip
                                through various countries in the Far East; his conversation with U
                                Ba Swe was reported in telegram 732 from Rangoon, Nov. 3.
                                (102.202/11–352)</note> the latter advanced the presence of the
                                <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops as one of Burma’s
                            principal problems which, he said, resulted in a constant invitation to
                            Chinese Communist troops to invade Burma. Ba Swe estimated the hardcore
                            strength of <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops at only about
                            2,000 who could be repatriated, if not through Thailand, then through
                            Burma internally by air and thence by ship. He suggested that the <gloss
                                target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> might “surrender” to neutral
                            officers—for example, to Americans—and lay down their arms for the
                            duration of the repatriation only, the arms to be returned to them on
                            shipboard after leaving Burma. In commenting on Ba Swe’s proposal, our
                            Embassy in Rangoon remarked that the figure of 2,000 appeared on the low
                            side, although the Minister may have been speaking only of officers and
                            NCO’s. Our Embassy added that such a surrender to “neutral officers”
                            might offer a possible solution to the dilemma—assuming Taipei would
                            agree to give the necessary orders and the <gloss target="#t_KMT1"
                                >KMT</gloss> would obey; and that if they should refuse to carry out
                            such orders, the only alternative would appear to be a complete
                            disavowal by the Taipei Government of its troops in Burma.</p>
                        <p>The Defense Minister has been active, more or less on his own account, in
                            seeking a solution to the problem through repatriation, and he has made
                            use of … as liaison with General Li Mi. (To date … has had no success;
                            it has been reported that he met with Li Mi at Chiengmai in Thailand but
                            that Li Mi flatly refused to consider repatriation through Rangoon.)
                            Moreover, the Supreme Commander of Burma’s armed forces indicated some
                            time ago that he would be glad to see the <gloss target="#t_KMT1"
                                >KMT</gloss> repatriated through Rangoon, and their arms returned on
                            shipboard. On the other hand Burma’s Prime Minister, U Nu, has announced
                            publicly that repatriation is not in question and that the Burmese
                            military will shortly move against the <gloss target="#t_KMT1"
                                >KMT</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Whether or not United States representations and/or action would at this
                            juncture be successful in actually removing the troops, it is imperative
                            in the interests of preserving our good relations with Burma that we
                            convince the Burmese Government, once and for all, that we are not

                            on their territory and that we have done everything in our power to help

                                        the Psychological Strategy Board that day, the Director of
                                        Central Intelligence, Walter Bedell Smith, indicated that he
                                        “wished to have the State Department agree to the evacuation
                                        of the Li Mi contingents from Burma.” The memorandum notes
                                        that Bruce discussed the subject later that day with U.

                                    Burma’s arms requirements, within two weeks after his arrival in
                                    Rangoon, but that various circumstances, including the absence
                                    of the Prime Minister from Rangoon and his own subsequent
                                    travels, had made a decision on this question impractical, and
                                    that he had not yet written the promised letter. However, in the
                                    meantime, some doubt had arisen in governmental circles, and in
                                    his own mind, concerning the advisability of making a request
                                    for arms procurement from the United States at this time. These
                                    doubts rested upon the fear that the new Administration<note

                                    adopt a different attitude toward Burma, and that any Burmese
                                    request, if denied, could give rise to serious repercussions
                                    among some members of the Government. He said that he did not
                                    wish to make a request to the United States for arms procurement
                                    unless he could be assured in advance that the request would be
                                    granted.</p>
                                <p>I said that, while I could not, of course, speak for the new
                                    Administration, which had not yet taken office, and that
                                    anything which I might say would therefore be based upon my own
                                    analysis of the situation, I felt that it was public knowledge
                                    that the Republican Party and its leaders had stated that they
                                    would give much greater attention to the problems of Asia than
                                    had hitherto been the case. In any event, I had reason to
                                    believe that the United States Government as at present
                                    constituted, would most probably look with favor upon a request
                                    by Burma for arms procurement, provided the conditions of the
                                    relevant legislation were met. I also doubted very much that the
                                    new Administration under President <pb n="41" xml:id="pg_41"
                                        facs="0061"/>Eisenhower would act differently. However, in
                                    order to guard against the possibility of a refusal, it might be
                                    well if an informal approach were made by the <gloss
                                        target="#t_GUB1">GUB</gloss> to the Embassy to ascertain in
                                    advance what the reaction of the United States Government would
                                    be to a specific request for arms procurement. Such request
                                    should include a list of the items which are desired, and a
                                    timetable of such requirements. I stressed, however, the
                                    necessity that the <gloss target="#t_GUB1">GUB</gloss> consult
                                    with the British Services Mission in advance, so that we might
                                    be assured that the British are aware of what is being done. I
                                    felt sure that he understood that our relations with Britain are
                                    very close and the we all must of necessity be above-board and
                                    work together in transactions of this kind. General Ne Win said
                                    that he had already consulted with the British and felt sure
                                    that they understood the situation.</p>
                                <p>I told General Ne Win that I had heard that he was considering
                                    renewing the agreement with the <gloss target="#t_BSM1"

                                    years. He said that no decision had been reached in this regard,
                                    but that some decision must, of course, be made prior to January
                                    31, 1953, when the present agreement expires. He related some
                                    difficulties which have recently arisen between officers of his
                                    staff and some of the British officers—difficulties which he
                                    attributed largely to personality clashes. He said that several
                                    British officers were attempting to use the recently
                                    reestablished good relations between the British and Burmese for
                                    bargaining purposes to “feather their own nests”. He is
                                    presently studying these problems in conjunction with Air

                                    >KMT</gloss>’s to the Communists, and their advance southward
                                almost as far as Tavoy, where, it appears, an effort is perhaps
                                being made to join up with the Communists in Malaya; and,
                                information to the effect that some twelve <gloss target="#t_KMT1"
                                    >KMT</gloss> officers had been instructed to return to Taipei,

                        </list>
                        <p>I said that I was, of course fully aware of the dangerous potentialities
                            of the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> problem and hoped that we
                            could be of some help in suggesting a solution. I intimated that we were
                            thinking about ways and means to resolve this problem, but it appeared
                            to us that the crux of the problem lies in an answer to the question
                            whether <pb n="42" xml:id="pg_42" facs="0062"/>the <gloss
                                target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss>’s would carry out orders given to them
                            by Taipei. Should the answer be in the affirmative, I wondered whether
                            the <gloss target="#t_GUB1">GUB</gloss> would agree to allow the <gloss
                                target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss>’s to pass through Burmese territory to
                            be placed on shipboard either at Rangoon or some other port. General Ne
                            Win replied that there would be no question but that such permission
                            would be granted, and further, that the <gloss target="#t_KMT1"
                                >KMT</gloss>’s arms would be returned to them. I said that we would
                            further consider the problem, and if we could discover any practical way
                            in which we might be of help, I would let him know through the Foreign
                            Office.</p>
                        <p>General Ne Win spoke at some length concerning the danger that the
                            Chinese Communists might use the presence of the <gloss target="#t_KMT1"
                                >KMT</gloss>’s in Burma to infiltrate their own operatives and
                            troops into Burma. He spoke of Naw Seng, a Kachin leader, who is
                            presently in China near the Burma border with some three hundred troops.
                            Should Naw Seng and his followers enter Burma, he felt certain that the
                            morale of the Communists in Burma would be raised to a considerable
                            extent, and that this would raise further difficulties. He also said
                            that it is presently necessary to deploy at least six battalions of
                            troops to watch the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss>’s. He is also
                            under considerable pressure to use a greater portion of his Army to
                            drive out the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops.</p>
                        <p>General Ne Win mentioned Singh (concerning whom <hi rend="italic">The
                                Nation</hi> had recently published an account). He said that his
                            intelligence had known of Singh for about two years. He is from Manipur
                            and maintains close connections with the Indian Communist Party as well
                            as with the Chinese Communists.</p>

                                    Matthews. It was apparently not forwarded to Bruce, but was
                                    returned to Allison with an attached memorandum of Jan. 22, from
                                    Frederick E. Nolting, Jr., Special Assistant to the Deputy Under
                                    Secretary, which reads as follows:</p>
                                <p>“Mr. Matthews agrees with the conclusions and recommendations of
                                    the attached paper. He feels, however, that probably the best
                                    and quickest way to get Defense Department concurrence is via
                                    General Magruder who, I believe, is familiar with the problem
                                    and who may decide that it is not necessary to take the matter
                                    up with the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>. If I can be of
                                    help in taking the matter up with General Magruder, please let
                                    me know.</p>
                                <p>“ … General Smith has been informed that such a plan exists, but
                                    he has not concurred in the plan itself.</p>
                                <p>“We agree that the plan to evacuate the KTM troops through
                                    Thailand is the more feasible of the two possibilities, and
                                    assume that we will press first for this solution.”</p>

                                <p>The <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops in Burma were
                                    presumably regarded at one time as of potential value either as
                                    the nucleus of a guerrilla force which could move into and
                                    operate in China or as a bastion of defense against a southward
                                    advance of Communist Chinese into Southeast Asia. As events have
                                    turned out, there is no indication that these troops will ever
                                    move into China for guerrilla warfare against Communist forces
                                    or even return to their homes. When they did attempt to move
                                    into China they were driven out. As regards their value as a
                                    defensive force they are in conflict with the authorities of the
                                    country they occupy and there is reason to believe that now they
                                    are of less military value to the free world as a support to
                                    regional defense than the regularly organized Burmese Army with
                                    which the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops in Burma
                                    are bound to be in conflict as long as they remain on Burmese
                                    territory. The matter is therefore believed to concern an
                                    over-all regional interest as well as the relations of the

                                <p>The above ground Communist opposition in Burma has made sedulous
                                    use of the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> situation to
                                    heckle the Government. The free press has continued to focus a
                                    spotlight on what has become a running sore until public opinion
                                    is being brought to a boiling point against the affront to
                                    Burma’s sovereignty. Unless it soon appears that some thing is
                                    being done public pressure may goad the Burmese military into
                                    undertaking a large-scale offensive against the Chinese
                                    Nationalist troops in Burma. This the Burmese have naturally
                                    been reluctant to do because available troops are needed for
                                    fighting the local Communist and other insurgents.</p>
                                <p>A recent increase in <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss>
                                    activity, bringing with it an intensified interest on the part
                                    of the Burmese press, has given rise to a spate of reporting on
                                    the situation. It appears certain that the Chinese Nationalists
                                    have indeed been more active in the last few months than they
                                    had for some time before. In early December the Supreme
                                    Commander of Burma’s armed forces expressed concern over a
                                    report that 300–500 Chinese Nationalists had switched allegiance
                                    to the Communists and were moving into the southerly peninsula
                                    of the Tavoy-Mergui area, with the possible aim of seeking
                                    contact with Malayan Communist elements. Other reports reached
                                    the Burmese War Office of suspected infiltration of <gloss
                                        target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> ranks by Chinese Communist
                                    officers in the Shan States. Reports continued to point up the
                                    insolent behavior of the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss>
                                    elements in the area of Kengtung. One press story claimed that
                                    about 500 Chinese Nationalist troops had moved into the seat of
                                    local government in the Shan state of Monghsu (about 90 miles
                                    WNW of Kengtung) and had occupied the ruling Sawbwa’s official
                                    residence and taken over the tax functions. The Burmese War
                                    Office confirmed this report and admitted the local Sawbwa was
                                    bringing pressure on the Burmese Government to divert troops to
                                    the area to drive the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> out.

                                    of a practical plan but raised several points requiring careful
                                    thought and planning. He also enumerated certain difficulties to
                                    be overcome. He felt that Chiang Kai-shek would not agree to the
                                    plan unless satisfied that it had the backing of the new U.S.
                                    Administration and said that a direct request to Chiang to order
                                    his troops out of Burma would risk almost certain refusal unless
                                    the ground were carefully prepared in advance. Mr. Rankin
                                    recommended careful investigation of how the plan would be
                                    financed and urged study of whether evacuation of 2,000 or
                                    3,000, which would be only a portion of the total, would be
                                    worthwhile. He recommended evacuation via Thailand, if possible,
                                    pointing out that transportation southward from Kengtung to
                                    Bangkok would be much simpler than southwest from Kengtung to
                                    Rangoon over mountain ranges.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Rankin expressed the belief that some of the Chinese military
                                    on Formosa would object on the ground that the <gloss
                                        target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops in Burma had great
                                    potential defense value and together with guerrillas in South
                                    China were in fact now tying down two Chinese Communist armies
                                    in Yunnan. Other Chinese authorities, who have given up
                                    cherished projects in the interest of achieving a balanced
                                    budget, would oppose expenditures on a repatriation project
                                    which was of less concern to them than projects they had given
                                    up. We would have to anticipate the possibility that the Chinese
                                    Government would claim that it did not have control over <gloss
                                        target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops in Burma and that
                                    General Li Mi himself controlled only a portion of them.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Rankin wrote that he was convinced that in order to induce
                                    the Chinese troops in Burma to obey an order to leave Burma it
                                    would be necessary to make a lump sum payment to each officer

                                    agree to transportation of the troops via Thailand provided the

                        <p>The previously prepared outline of proposed steps has been modified to
                            provide for the possibility of moving the troops out of Burma to
                            Thailand and from Bangkok to Formosa by Chinese Nationalist vessel. It
                            is not believed necessary to work out in detail a plan of action for
                            evacuation via Thailand at this time. The original proposals have been
                            amended (tab 1) to provide that if Chiang Kai-shek agrees to the plan
                            and Li Mi’s cooperation is assured, the Burmese Government will be
                            informed that the U.S. Government is prepared to associate itself with
                            the Chinese Nationalist Government on Formosa in asking the Government
                            of Thailand whether it would be prepared to allow evacuation via
                            Thailand and, if so, under what conditions. The Burmese Government might
                            be asked if it would be willing to associate itself with this move by
                            making inquiry on the subject through its Embassy in Bangkok. If the
                            Thai Government should agree to evacuation via Thailand the troops could
                            move southward by foot to Chiengmai and by rail from Chiengmai to
                            Bangkok. No airlift would be necessary and the extent of assistance
                            required from the Department of Defense would be less than if evacuation
                            were to be via Rangoon. Evacuation via Thailand would have the further
                            advantage of permitting direct contact between the Chinese Nationalist
                            troops and Chinese Nationalist representatives in Thailand and direct
                            communication regarding the progress of evacuation between the Thai
                            Government and the Government on Formosa.…</p>
                        <p>With regard to Mr. Rankin’s query as to whether evacuation of 2,000 to
                            3,000 would be worthwhile it is believed that if the United States can
                            help arrange the departure of even a smaller number of the <gloss
                                target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops in Burma the action will redound
                            to the benefit of the United States. In preparatory steps to secure
                            President Chiang’s agreement to order the <gloss target="#t_KMT1"
                                >KMT</gloss> troops out of Burma it is recognized that one obstacle
                            is that mentioned by Mr. Rankin in his letter of December 18, namely,
                            that some of President Chiang’s <pb n="47" xml:id="pg_47" facs="0067"
                            />military advisers will maintain that the <gloss target="#t_KMT1"
                                >KMT</gloss> troops in Burma are of greater potential usefulness
                            where they are than they would have to be in Formosa.</p>
                        <p>Both Mr. Rankin and Mr. Stanton have expressed the opinion that some form
                            of lump-sum payment would have to be made to the soldiers in order to
                            induce them to obey orders to leave Burma. While it is not absolutely
                            certain that it would be necessary to make such payments the possibility
                            of this being necessary requires consideration of whether there are
                            political or other objections to making such payments and, if not, how
                            the necessary funds are to be obtained and disbursed. It may be assumed
                            that no such payment to any individual soldier would be made until after
                            he had laid down his arms and agreed to submit to the authorities
                            directing the departure of soldiers from Burma. It may be assumed also
                            that in order to provide the inducement, if payments are necessary, the
                                <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops would have to be given
                            some promise of payment so that they would know that they may expect to
                            receive a payment if they lay down their arms.</p>
                        <p>If evacuation is to be via Rangoon, aircraft must be obtained for an
                            airlift from Kengtung to Rangoon. Travel on foot from Kengtung to
                            Rangoon is probably not practicable. The question of availability of
                            such aircraft is a matter which should be discussed with the Department
                            of Defense with a view to determining whether U.S. military aircraft
                            could be used and, if so, under what conditions and in what quantity.
                            Even if evacuation is to be via Thailand full concurrence of the
                            Department of Defense is desirable in view of various military
                            considerations involved in these proposals.</p>

                        <p>It is recommended that the proposal that a plan be worked out for removal

                            be sent to the Embassies at Taipei, Rangoon and Bangkok and that the
                            Chargé d’Affaires in Taipei be instructed to make the initial approach
                            to Chiang Kai-shek that will be necessary to carry out the first step in

                                have made forays into Yunnan, may provide a pretext for Chinese
                                Communist intervention in Burma. Finally, the presence of these

                                    whether such withdrawal practicable. He was referring to unknown
                                    attitude of Burmese and Thai Governments and to his limited
                                    authority over Nationalist “guerrillas” in Burma including even
                                    Li Mi. He would not issue such orders unless he believed they

                                    because of effect on Yunnan people who look to Li Mi for

                                    organized guerrillas would end and Communists left free

                                    that it was important to disassociate Chinese Nationalist
                                    Government much as possible from situation in North Burma which
                                    now apparently developing to advantage only of

                                    different, but they reportedly are in Burma much nearer Thailand
                                    than Yunnan frontier and not even in “undefined” border area
                                    between Burma and Yunnan. Troops are in territory of country
                                    with which US maintains friendly relations and which we hope can

                                <item>This was first important request to Chinese Government from
                                    new US administration, and even if Chiang convinced he was right
                                    and we wrong I considered it would be wise for him to

                                <item>He had made incidental reference possible “insistence” on part
                                    of US. I remarked that character of my instructions was
                                    distinctly one of insistence.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Chiang responded that he would give us an answer but could not do so
                            before he saw Li Mi.</p>
                        <p>Later in evening Chiang told me he was considering counter proposals
                            which would satisfy Burmese. I said I would transmit any such
                            proposals.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> I believe case has been put to Chiang as
                            strongly as possible with material at my disposal. Although this matter
                            has been at issue between US and Chinese Government for at least three
                            years, during which time our policy has varied considerably more than
                            that of Chinese Government, this Embassy has never been kept informed
                            officially of real facts. We have had to proceed on basis of
                            instructions which were at times almost incomprehensible, of reports
                            from Chinese sources and from accidental American contacts plus
                            scattered and often doubtful information relayed from Rangoon and
                            elsewhere. There must be available to the US Government reliable
                            information as to the true facts which we should have in presenting our
                            case.</p>
                        <p>Li Mi of course denies that his troops have taken food without payment,
                            or have operated with Karens against Burmese forces, or have committed
                            other hostile acts which unconfirmed reports from Rangoon allege. He
                            would say that these are either propaganda or the work of elements which
                            would contrive to operate in such manner or worse if his troops
                            withdrawn. All of this not germane <pb n="58" xml:id="pg_58" facs="0078"

                            procedure.</p>
                        <p>I shall continue follow matter urgently with Chinese Government.</p>

                        <p>Li Mi said he has 26,000 troops of whom best 14,000 located east of
                            Salween including less than 2,000 with whom he retreated from Yunnan
                            summer of 1950. Others came out with him after abortive 1951 incursion
                            into Yunnan. He is now receiving subsidy from Chinese Government of
                            200,000 Thai ticals monthly. Last payment of US $25,000 from other
                            sources received last July. About 50 radio operators and other
                            technicians sent to him from Formosa by air in 1951; since then no
                            reinforcements or replacements received from anywhere although
                            occasional stragglers or refugees join his forces. Only supplies sent to
                            him from Formosa for more than one year came by PBYs of local Foshing
                            Airline which land at Mong Hsat. They must carry fuel for return trip
                            and “pay load” is only about 1 ton for each of 21 trips made to date.
                            Usually consists largely of medical supplies and communications
                            equipment.</p>
                        <p>Contrary to reports from Rangoon, Li Mi insisted he had not ordered
                            attacks on Burmese. His standing orders from Generalissimo forbid it and
                            he not only has no desire make such attacks but no purpose doing so.
                            Recent clashes, which he indicates have been grossly exaggerated began
                            last summer after return of Burmese mission from Peking. Reversing
                            previous custom of avoiding contact, Burmese began harassing Chinese
                            Nationalist Forces, especially ambushing small unarmed groups and in one
                            case turning over 100 captives to Chinese Communists for slaughter. His
                            forces being guerrillas and under loose discipline occasionally got out
                            of hand and retaliated but this small scale and against his orders.</p>
                        <p>Li Mi said only about 1,000 Burmese troops east of Salween. They are
                            deployed along East-West Road; he could wipe them out anytime but had no
                            desire do so. General Li gave detailed order of <pb n="62"

                            showing positions and strength throughout country of forces of Burmese
                            Government, red flag, white flag, Karens, Chinese Nationalists, etc.,
                            emphasizing that Burmese held chiefly main lines of communications
                            (“where they could protect British interests”). He evidently considers
                            position of Burmese Government virtually hopeless vis-à-vis Communists
                            and in fact believes Thakin Nu Communist sympathizer. Withdrawal or
                            dissolution of Chinese Nationalist guerrilla forces would remove last
                            serious obstacle to Communist take-over in Li’s opinion.</p>
                        <p>I reviewed to General Li instructions received from Department and
                            already transmitted to Generalissimo. He replied it useless to order his
                            forces out of Burma except for return to Yunnan to fight; they would not
                            understand and would not obey. Particularly since outside aid reduced to
                            trickle (which “would not support 20,000 chickens”) his men forced fend
                            for themselves. Some work for Karens, many are farming, large proportion
                            either have families with them from Yunnan or have set up households
                            with native women; Formosa is to them foreign land of which they as
                            Yunnanese know nothing. They want to stay where they are until they can
                            return home. In fact he believed his forces could survive as guerrillas
                            even if Communists should overrun southeast Asia. He had told
                            Generalissimo all this and said he would not transmit orders to evacuate
                            since he knew it to be useless.</p>
                        <p>Looking at order of battle on map, Foreign Minister remarked Chinese
                            Nationalist and Burmese forces so disposed there seemed no reason for
                            them to clash; also that only sizable anti-Communist forces anywhere
                            near most of Yunnan border were Chinese Nationalists and their
                            withdrawal would leave it wide open.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion General Li urged sending American observers to obtain true
                            picture. Possibility their being accompanied by official Burmese
                            observer was discussed and Li Mi had no objection. (This later cleared
                            with President Chiang who would welcome such American inspection with
                            Burmese observer attached.)</p>

                                Mi’s presentation, as far as the Embassy was able to judge, was
                                substantially factual, and he reported that Yeh told him if the
                                matter was brought up formally in the United Nations, his government
                                would have no alternative to disavowing the troops in Burma and
                                making a “full and frank” statement disclosing “chaotic conditions”
                                in Burma. Rankin requested that the Department review items a, b,
                                and c and the subsequent paragraph at the end of telegram 616 to
                                Taipei (<ref target="#d39">Document 39</ref>) in light of Li Mi’s

                            issues orders to Li Mi to evacuate Burma and that these orders be made

                                the subject of the troops in Burma which he proposed to give to

                            Secretary Smith this afternoon and told that after thorough study of
                            whole problem of <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops in Burma it
                            had been determined that on balance most acceptable solution of problem
                            is for Chinese Government to agree at once that troops should be ordered
                            out of Burma. Under Secretary informed Koo that this matter had been
                            discussed with President and Secretary and that it was desire of US
                            Government that Chinese take necessary action as soon as possible. It
                            was pointed out that it would be futile for US to make further
                            representations to Burmese Government to keep matter out of <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> unless it could inform latter officially
                            at least that Chinese had agreed in principle to removal of troops. If
                            this agreement in principle can be communicated to Burmese, US will make
                            strongest efforts to get them to postpone presentation of matter to
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and will announce its willingness
                            to assist in all proper manner to implement Chinese decision.</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary also emphasized that it was most reasonable for
                            Generalissimo to want to concentrate his forces on Formosa. Koo was
                            informed that US would be willing to make representations to <pb n="65"
                                xml:id="pg_65" facs="0085"/>Burmese Government to the end that
                            troops in Burma would be given safe conduct out of country and that if
                            it should not prove possible or desirable to bring all their equipment
                            with them it might be that equivalent equipment could be provided upon
                            their arrival in Formosa.</p>
                        <p>Koo was told that Burmese Ambassador to US, who has been ordered back to
                            Rangoon to discuss problem of presenting matter to <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, would visit Department afternoon March 9
                            and it would be most helpful if prior to his visit Chinese Government
                            had agreed in principle to US request. In such case Department would
                            make strenuous efforts to get Burmese Ambassador to recommend that his
                            Government not proceed with matter in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.
                            The US would use its good offices with Burmese Government to negotiate
                            agreement on how troops can be removed safely. Ambassador was also told
                            in strict confidence that if necessary US Government could probably
                            obtain some funds for assistance in providing shipping to take troops
                            back to Formosa.</p>
                        <p>You should approach Foreign Minister along similar lines to the above and
                            urge speedy action. If Chinese will agree in principle to removal of
                            troops and to US making this known officially to Burmese Government,
                            request comments of Taipei and Rangoon on possible formation joint
                            Burmese-Chinese-US commission which could negotiate matter and if
                            necessary visit territory where troops are to determine what most
                            practicable steps would be. US recognizes that implementation of any
                            such agreement would take considerable time but is convinced that unless
                            some definite action is taken Burmese cannot be persuaded to keep matter
                            out of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>

                                refrain from taking any offensive action against Burmese Government
                                troops. In addition, the Chinese Government declared it would
                                suspend its monthly subsidy to Li Mi for the purchase of medical
                                supplies, it would do its best to stop the raising of private funds
                                for the purpose of supplying Li’s troops, and it would give no
                                clearance to any further flights to the area where the troops were
                                based from any airfield on Taiwan. (690B.9321/3–853)</note></p>

                            688 March 11<note n="1" xml:id="d47fn1">Telegram 688 reported the
                                Department’s opinion that a tripartite investigatory body might be
                                of value but only if the Chinese first agreed in principle to the
                                removal of the troops. (690B.9321/3–1053)</note> regarding troops in
                            Burma. His opinion remains that Chinese Government cannot announce
                            agreement in principle to action President Chiang and others consider
                            impracticable. Also that until exact composition and voting procedure of
                            investigatory body determined Chinese Government cannot agree abide by
                            its findings. However Foreign Minister will again discuss Department’s
                            position with Chiang.</p>
                        <p>Recent press dispatches from Rangoon apparently confirmed Foreign
                            Minister’s expectation that advance commitment by Chinese Government to
                            withdraw troops would be publicized by Burmese as victory before facts
                            ascertained and implementation agreed upon. Such publicity has already
                            occurred in anticipation of Chinese Government commitment which latter
                            may now consider itself forced to deny in order offset adverse effects
                            on Li Mi’s troops and Chinese public opinion which it had hoped to
                            avoid.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister said new report just received by Minister of National
                            Defense of another Burmese attack with planes and armor on Chinese
                            forces. He remarked continuation such attacks may leave no alternative
                            to simply allowing Burmese mop up Li Mi forces as best they can.
                            Meanwhile he said orders had been issued to Chinese Air Force to allow
                            no plane take off for Burma from any airport here.</p>
                        <p>Actually an agreement to set up tripartite body which would investigate
                            situation and report seems to go long way toward meeting legitimate
                            demands of Burmese. It appears certain that majority of Chinese
                            including families in Northeast Burma could not be handled in operation
                            such as that under discussion to date. Investigators could therefore
                            report on this aspect in addition to evacuation of certain number of
                            military.</p>
                        <p>I recommend we seek agreement with Chinese Government and Burma
                            Government on setting up investigatory body creation of which would in
                            itself be substantial concession to Burmese position <pb n="71"

                        <p>Your 956 gives impression Chinese Government consider themselves almost
                            at war with Burma and that they look upon order for <gloss

                            Burma. US does not understand this reasoning. As pointed out to
                            Ambassador Koo and reported Department’s 671 to Taipei,<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d48fn5"><ref target="#d43">Document 43</ref>.</note>
                            concentration of outlying forces in Taipei would be sound military move.
                            It would not in any way constitute a surrender to Burma.</p>
                        <p>In view fact that Chinese troops are on Burmese territory without
                            permission as result of defeat by Chinese Communists and that they have
                            been thrown back into Burma by Chinese Communists when attempting return
                            to Yunnan, it is difficult understand Chinese Foreign Minister
                            suggesting that agreement set up tripartite body to investigate would go
                            long way toward “meeting legitimate demands of Burmese.” Burmese
                            completely within their rights in demanding expulsion these troops from
                            Burmese territory and if Chinese Government will not even agree in
                            principle that this should be done, US Government would find great

                            President Chiang or Foreign Minister but that Department speaks for US
                            Government as whole (Department telegram 700, March 13). However I have
                            made this specific point on various occasions during current discussions
                            regarding Chinese troops in Burma.</p>
                        <p>Comment in paragraph 4 my telegram 956, March 12 was based upon expressed
                            readiness Chinese Government to meet two out of three US demands
                            (numbered paragraph 8 Department’s telegram 616, February 24) and to
                            despatch of observers to determine practicability of third. Essential
                            difference between US (penultimate paragraph Department’s telegram 671,
                            March 6) and Chinese Government positions therefore appears to have been
                            narrowed down to whether establishment of joint body to be preceded by
                            Chinese Government agreement in principle to remove troops.</p>

                        <p>Foreign Minister has been left in no doubt but that US rejects proposal
                            to determine practicability before Chinese Government agrees in
                            principle (Department’s telegram 659, March 5<note n="1" xml:id="d49fn1"
                                >Telegram 659 to Taipei stated that the Department saw no point in
                                sending observers to the affected area, since the question was not
                                one of the facts in the case but of the overall political

                            flatly to Foreign Minister today. He promised transmit my statement to

                            US position.</p>
                        <p>Suggestion last paragraph Department’s telegram 700 would represent new
                            departure. Does Department wish me to inform Chiang that refusal to
                            agree as above would “indicate US should take new look at whole Chinese
                            situation” regarding “present policies toward Formosa”?<note n="3"

                                    the Foreign Minister’s letter of that date to Sebald, the first
                                    paragraph of which reads as follows:</p>
                                <p>“As you are aware <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> activities
                                    within the territories of the Union of Burma have now assumed a
                                    character which leaves no doubt that they are fully supported
                                    and sustained by the Nationalist Government of China. This fact
                                    raises serious political problems for us and in solving these
                                    problems we consider it essential that an atmosphere is created
                                    which will leave no doubt that our efforts to expel the <gloss
                                        target="#t_KMT1">KMTs</gloss> are genuinely motivated by the
                                    desire to rid our territories of foreign troops. The
                                    continuation of a foreign program will in our view mitigate
                                    against the creation of such an atmosphere and I am therefore to
                                    request under Article V of the Economic Cooperation Agreement
                                    between our two governments that the Government of the United
                                    States of America will accept notice that we do not desire the
                                    aid program to continue beyond June 30, 1953 until such time as
                                    the Government of the Union of Burma are able to settle the

                                <p>The letter concluded by expressing appreciation for the materials
                                    and services received under the U.S. aid program.</p></note>
                            After reading letter I said that it appeared to me this action
                            ill-advised and possibly result feeling of frustration to which <gloss
                                target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> problem has given rise in Burma. I
                            pointed out that linking <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> activities
                            with termination <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> program was in
                            effect joining two entirely separate matters. If Burma wished rid itself
                                <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> program that problem could be
                            discussed on its merits. But to combine with <gloss target="#t_KMT1"
                                >KMT</gloss> problem was in the nature of attempting force United
                            States do something it already doing.</p>
                        <p>I said situation appeared to me to be following: Burma requested good
                            offices United States find solution <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss>
                            troop problem. United States agreed and since request received has been
                            attempting find solution on an urgent basis. Unfortunately progress not
                            as rapid as might be hoped, but negotiations with Chinese Nationalist
                            Government, nevertheless continuing. <gloss target="#t_GUB1">GUB</gloss>
                            not satisfied with results now gives notice to United States Government
                            its desire terminate <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> agreement until
                                <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> issue solved. It seemed to me
                            this reasoning would merely perplex American Government and people and
                            could not help find solution. Would in fact result hindrance
                            negotiations now being carried on Taipei. Foreign Minister replied this
                            matter has been under consideration for some time … and had only today
                            been approved as proper course of <pb n="75" xml:id="pg_75" facs="0095"
                            />action by Cabinet. He denied Government linking <gloss

                                >TCA</gloss> (concerning which he spoke in highest terms of
                            appreciation) and said intention was merely marshall all possible forces
                            against <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMTs</gloss> to drive them out of Burma
                            and also raise matter in aggressive terms in United Nations. To be
                            receiving aid from United States Government during this painful process
                            might be embarrassing to United States Government and might be
                            misunderstood by other countries.</p>
                        <p>(I am inclined believe Prime Minister feels military action against
                            Chinese Nationalist troops is wounding to United States and that
                            continued acceptance of aid from United States under these circumstances
                            somehow irreconcilable and immoral.)</p>
                        <p>On basis my remarks as above I suggested reconsideration contemplated
                            action. Foreign Minister said unfortunately he now exercising mandate
                            received from Cabinet and perforce must deliver letter to me. He
                            promised, however, again discuss with Prime Minister this evening and in
                            meantime agreed I should merely hold letter pending final decision. I
                            said in any event, before decision becomes final I would wish discuss
                            matter with Prime Minister. Foreign Minister said he would tell Prime
                            Minister accordingly.</p>
                        <p>While I was leaving Foreign Minister said aid program would not of
                            course, be affected if <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troop problem
                            solved.</p>

                        <p>1792. <gloss target="#t_mytel1">Mytel</gloss> 1772, March 17. Had lengthy
                            interview with Prime Minister this morning during which I reviewed for
                            him developments leading up to delivery Foreign Minister’s letter to me.
                            I especially pointed out my perplexity at linking <gloss
                                target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> problem with <gloss target="#t_TCA1"
                                >TCA</gloss> aid program and difficulties which reasoning of <gloss
                                target="#t_GUB1">GUB</gloss> would cause among American Government
                            and people. I asked Prime Minister frankly tell me whether <gloss
                                target="#t_GUB1">GUB</gloss> in fact desires continue <gloss
                                target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> program or whether for reasons unknown
                            to me <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> problem was being used as
                            pretext terminate aid program.</p>
                        <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0097"/>
                        <p>Prime Minister said decision embodied in Foreign Minister’s letter was
                            arrived at with utmost reluctance by himself and members his Cabinet. He
                            said almost without exception Cabinet desires continuance <gloss
                                target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> program faced as they are with
                            realization Burma must have technical assistance and that America is
                            only country having capability supplying this aid.</p>
                        <p>On other hand serious crisis had arisen among important supporters <gloss
                                target="#t_AFPFL1">AFPFL</gloss> Government who in effect were
                            accusing Prime Minister and colleagues accepting “hush money” in guise
                            of United States aid, an accusation to which credence was lent by
                            failure over past two years <gloss target="#t_GUB1">GUB</gloss> settle
                                <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> problem and apparent lethargy
                            and satisfaction allow <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops remain
                            on Burmese territory. This movement among responsible supporters aided
                            and abetted by vocal opposition assumed such serious proportions that
                            Government felt drastic measures must be taken remove all pretexts for
                            charges. This in essence was reason why <gloss target="#t_KMT1"
                                >KMT</gloss> problem was linked with aid program. He felt action was
                            taken to save the Government and country as he felt with an apologetic
                            aside, that only <gloss target="#t_AFPFL1">AFPFL</gloss> Government is
                            capable constructively governing Burma under present conditions.</p>
                        <p>After above explanation Prime Minister said “I give you my word of honor
                            when <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> matter is settled you will see
                            that we will be anxious resume aid program and gladly and gratefully
                            accept as little or as much as your Government will offer us providing
                            you are still interested in pursuing your aid program.” Prime Minister
                            emphasized that short of sending troops to Korea he and his Government
                            were doing everything possible to fight communism. Reiterated Burma

                        <p>[Here follows discussion of relations between the United States and the
                            Republic of China.]</p>
                        <p>When the Ambassador arose to depart, the Secretary asked him, “When are
                            you going to get your troops out of Burma?”, and went on to express
                            briefly to the Ambassador the seriousness with which the United States
                            Government viewed the situation in Burma. The Ambassador said that he
                            had had nothing in the past few days from his Government but that he
                            hoped steps that it had already taken were helpful. Mr. Allison stated
                            that we appreciated what the Chinese Government had done but that we
                            still believed it necessary for the Chinese to agree in principle to the
                            removal of the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops from Burma and
                            that if this agreement could be given we would then be in a position to
                            go to the Burmese and request them not to bring this problem to the
                            United Nations. It would also then be possible to work out some form of
                            investigatory body or commission which could look into the practical
                            problems involved.</p>
                        <p>After the Ambassador had left the Secretary’s office he told Mr. Allison
                            that he thought his Government had received the wrong impression and
                            that it believed that the United States was demanding that at this time
                            it issue an unequivocal order to the Chinese troops in Burma to leave
                            the country. He said that his impression was that all we were asking was
                            for agreement in principle to issue such an order if after investigation
                            it proves practical to remove at least some of the troops from Burma.
                            Mr. Allison stated that while the United States believed the best
                            possible thing would be for the Chinese Government at this time to issue
                            an unequivocal order for the return of the <gloss target="#t_KMT1"
                                >KMT</gloss> troops, nevertheless we recognized the difficulties for
                            the Chinese in taking this step, but that we very strongly believed the
                            Chinese Government should authorize us to inform the Burmese Government
                            of its agreement in principle to the removal of the troops. Ambassador
                            Koo said he understood our <pb n="79" xml:id="pg_79" facs="0099"
                            />position and that he would telegraph again immediately to his

                        <p>988. In 40 minute talk with President Chiang this morning I reviewed
                            arguments for withdrawing Li Mi troops from Burma border region as
                            stated my telegram 878, February 22 and subsequently. I pointed out
                            again US position is result high-level interagency decision; also that
                            it would be most unfortunate at this time when possibility exists of
                            increased or accelerated US aid if Washington climate for discussing
                            such matters were adversely affected by Chinese Government refusal
                            accede to US desire in present case.</p>
                        <p>Generalissimo repeated his earlier arguments and asked why if US
                            supporting anti-Communist guerrilla activities elsewhere we are
                            unwilling support Li Mi. I replied that important difference exists in
                            that his troops are in Burma, which immediately places us in wrong in
                            eyes of free world besides weakening position of Burma Government which
                            our representatives in Rangoon believe could be saved from
                            Communists.</p>
                        <p>I then urged that whatever Chiang felt was right or wrong of matter it
                            would be better part of wisdom to agree in principle. I pointed out I
                            was not now asking him to issue actual order, to which he had previously
                            objected, but simply to agree in principle to withdrawal of his forces.
                            He replied this might prove impossible and I remarked it would not be
                            his fault if agreement in principle could not be implemented. (<hi
                                rend="italic">Comment:</hi> He seems obsessed with importance of
                            taking no step which would lead to his later being accused of bad faith.
                            For better or worse this is contrary to experience in many countries
                            where agreement in principle is freely given with no intention of
                            carrying out.)</p>
                        <p>Generalissimo then asked me put essence of foregoing in writing. I agreed
                            do this in letter to Foreign Minister which I am phrasing as follows:
                            “My understanding of US position is that immediate step requested of

                            connection).</p>
                        <p>Chiang informed me he had sent for Li Mi’s deputy to proceed Taipei

                                letter from Foreign Minister Yeh concerning Li Mi’s troops in Burma.
                                The first paragraph stated that the Chinese Government agreed in
                                principle to the withdrawal of the troops, but that in view of
                                practical difficulties expected in the implementation of such an
                                agreement, it could not be held responsible for not accomplishing
                                more than was feasible or reasonable under the circumstances. Rankin
                                noted that the phrasing of that paragraph had been modified slightly
                                “as result my suggestion to Foreign Minister this morning in effort
                                to meet Allison’s telephoned request of yesterday.” The second
                                paragraph declared that since the Chinese Government did not
                                exercise complete control over the troops, it would be futile to
                                advise them to withdraw until the cessation of attacks on them by
                                Burmese forces or by forces under the command of a Yunnan Communist
                                leader, who, the letter alleged, the Burmese Government was
                                supplying with arms. The third paragraph stated that the Chinese
                                argument in principle should be kept secret until ways had been
                                found to implement it, because premature disclosure might cause the
                                dispersal of Li Mi’s troops before they could be evacuated.

                            first paragraph as to make letter virtually meaningless and

                            are unable to accept as verified Taipei charge that Government of Burma
                            is supplying arms to any Yunnan or other Communist leader. Li Mi’s
                            forces admittedly will need assurance that they will not be massacred at
                            such time as they lay down their arms, but this cannot be obtained until
                            agreement in principle reached and withdrawal procedures arranged. No
                            reason is seen why unqualified Chinese Government agreement in principle
                            to withdrawal cannot be issued before withdrawal procedure arranged. We
                            cannot carry through our effort to establish investigative committee

                                    communicate in confidence to the Burmese and Thai Governments a
                                    statement that the Chinese Government agreed in principle to
                                    cooperate with the U.S. Government in effecting the removal of
                                    Li Mi’s troops from Burma, but that in view of the practical
                                    difficulties it envisaged, including the fact that it did not
                                    exercise full control over the troops, it could not be held
                                    responsible for not accomplishing more than was feasible or
                                    reasonable under the circumstances. (690B.9321/3–2753)</p>

                                    letter, dated Mar. 31, which included the above statement and an
                                    additional paragraph stating that the Chinese Government could
                                    not be expected to exercise any influence on Li Mi’s troops
                                    unless and until the Burmese attacks on them were ended. Rankin
                                    commented that he did not interpret the last paragraph as a
                                    qualification of the agreement but merely as a statement

                            examine our basic approach to Burma and reaction our policies have had

                            our relations.</p>
                        <p>One of our most serious handicaps has been that we have necessarily been
                            too conspicuous in Burma with too many Americans in evidence and too
                            much involvement in what Burmese consider their own internal affairs.
                            Unfortunately the concept of Point 4 aid has made this inevitable. Our …
                            operations have increased Burmese suspicion of our motives and have led
                            large number believe we have sinister designs on their independence and
                            integrity. At same time however, Burmese have become increasingly
                            anti-Communist as result experience with their own Communist insurgents
                            and observation Communist tactics in other countries. In absence
                            external aggression possibility local Communists gaining control this
                            country either through armed force or subversion appears remote. While
                            termination <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> aid will handicap
                            present rate economic development it will not materially increase

                            accepting aid they are limiting their own free democratic faction and
                            doing us favor by accommodating United States foreign policy objectives.
                            This impression is supported by apparent eagerness with which aid
                            offered, serious concern with which we faced possible termination aid

                                assistance to Burma as follows: In Phase I, Burma should request
                                assistance, and the assurances required by law should be negotiated;
                                in this phase, the United Kingdom should be informed but its
                                concurrence should not be solicited. In Phase II, there should be a
                                complete discussion between the Burmese Government, the British
                                Services Mission, and the U.S. attaché staff to formulate a mutually
                                acceptable list of Burmese arms requirements, culminating in Burmese
                                submission of this agreed list through diplomatic channels. In Phase
                                III, the Department of State would transmit the list with its
                                recommendations to the Department of Defense, which would determine
                                prices and availability. The Embassy was authorized to inform the
                                British Ambassador and the Burmese Government of these procedures
                                and to inform the Burmese that the United States would receive with
                                sympathy a diplomatic request for reimbursable military assistance.

                        </list>
                        <p>I called on President Chiang by appointment at 10:30 this morning and
                            reviewed with him various matters which I had discussed with Admiral
                            Radford in Hongkong on April 28.</p>
                        <p>With reference to Burma I said that both Admiral Radford and I considered
                            it important that the Chinese Government take further positive steps
                            toward remedying the situation involving General Li Mi’s forces in
                            northeast Burma. Specifically, I urged that he appoint a qualified
                            military officer, preferably one familiar with the situation and with a
                            good knowledge of English (I was thinking of Foreign Minister Yeh’s
                            candidate, Colonel I Fu-de, but did not mention his name), to proceed to
                            Bangkok and start informal discussions <pb n="102" xml:id="pg_102"
                                facs="0122"/>with American and Thai representatives. In response to
                            his question whether the Chinese representative would meet a Burmese
                            officer, I replied that this might or might not be desirable, but that
                            talks could be initiated with Thai and American representatives.</p>
                        <p>I went on to say that the Burmese seemed unwilling to order a cease-fire
                            without assurances that the Chinese would then immediately take steps
                            looking toward a withdrawal of Li Mi’s forces. The appointment of a
                            Chinese representative and his despatch to Bangkok seemed the best way
                            to get things started and to persuade the Burmese to stop military
                            operations. I noted that the longer matters were delayed the greater
                            would be the pressure from Li Mi’s men to obtain supplies, including
                            ammunition, from the outside. To supply any of their needs from Formosa,
                            in view of the undertakings of the Chinese Government here in Taipei and
                            at the United Nations in New York, seemed to me most unwise, and I added
                            that Admiral Radford agreed with me on this point. The facts would
                            certainly become known and serious embarrassment for both our
                            governments would result.</p>
                        <p>President Chiang replied with a laugh that there would be no suggestion
                            of any such support for Li Mi coming from the Americans. I answered that
                            whether we were directly blamed or not the effect would be the same, and
                            that both of us must preserve appearances.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion the President said that he would consult with the Ministers
                            of Foreign Affairs and Defense, and would let me have a reply as to the
                            appointment of a Chinese representative to go to Bangkok.<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d71fn1">On May 6, the Embassy reported that Col. I Fu-de was
                                selected as the Chinese representative on the committee. Li Mi
                                insisted that he could not assign a representative to the committee
                                prior to a ceasefire, but Rankin thought Colonel I could make such
                                informal contact with Li Mi’s representatives as might be necessary.

                        <p>The Joint Military Committee for the Evacuation of Foreign Forces from
                            Burma, consisting of representatives of Burma, the Republic of China,
                            Thailand, and the United States, held its first meeting in Bangkok on
                            May 22. Colonel Raymond D. Palmer, United States Army Attaché at Bangkok
                            and the United States representative on the Joint Committee, was named
                            chairman. Until June 16, the United States and Thai representatives met
                            alternately with the Burmese and Chinese representatives; the full
                            Committee also met for the first time on that date. The Burmese
                            representatives withdrew from the Committee on September 17; thereafter,
                            the Committee continued to function with Chinese, <pb n="105"

                        <p>A–222.… reports recently received by the Department indicate that there
                            is strong pressure by some groups within the Chinese Government not only
                            to prevent withdrawal of any part of Li Mi’s forces from Burma but to
                            maintain the flow of supplies to them. One report indicated that the
                            Chinese hoped to instigate a revolt among Shan leaders against Burmese
                            authority in order to set up an independent Shan state which the Chinese
                            could control. Another report alleges that efforts are being made by Fu
                            Shing Air Lines to purchase four-motored aircraft in the United States
                            presumably for the purpose of supplying Li Mi’s troops, and one report
                            even claims that a Chinese Air Force 4-motored bomber is currently
                            engaged in supply drops.</p>
                        <p>Although individually these reports are of questionable reliability,
                            there seems to be enough evidence of strong opposition to withdrawal of
                            Li Mi’s forces and of intention to continue their support from Formosa
                            on the part of some groups within the Chinese Government which have a
                            considerable degree of independence of action, such as the Continental
                            Operations Department, as to cast some doubt upon the ability of the
                            Chinese Government to follow through on its commitments to cooperate
                            actively with other interested parties to give effect to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution on the Li Mi forces.… Embassy
                            reports that it is the strongly-held view of the Chinese Foreign Office
                            that Li Mi’s forces should be withdrawn from Burma and that
                            whole-hearted cooperation should be given by the Chinese Government to
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>-sponsored efforts to this end.</p>
                        <p>While it is realized that the Embassy can not play any direct part in
                            what appears to be a serious conflict of views within the Chinese
                            Government on this issue, the Embassy may be able to strengthen the hand
                            of the Foreign Office by intimating during <pb n="106" xml:id="pg_106"
                                facs="0126"/>conversations with the Foreign Minister on the subject
                            of the Li Mi troops, its awareness of pressures within the Government
                            against the official position of the Chinese Government and the concern
                            of the U.S. Government that the Chinese Government adhere firmly to it.
                            In this connection, the Embassy may wish to point out to the Foreign
                            Minister that were air drops to the Li Mi troops in Burma to be
                            re-initiated, or any other attempt to resupply the Li Mi forces, this
                            activity would soon be discovered by the Burmese and make further
                            negotiations for the evacuation of these troops impossible. Such action
                            would not only be in direct contravention of Chinese Government
                            commitments to Burma and the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, but
                            would also constitute deliberate defiance of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> resolution.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances the Burmese Government could be expected to
                            press its complaint against the Chinese Government in the next <gloss
                                target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> with increased vigor and bitterness.
                            Judging by the considerable support and sympathy for the Burmese
                            position expressed in the last <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>, a
                            renewed Burmese attack under circumstances such as this might well
                            result in seriously undermining the Chinese Government’s position in the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, a process which may well have
                            already started as a result of the recent <gloss target="#t_GA1"
                                >GA</gloss> airing of the Burmese complaint. This would be
                            especially true if an armistice in Korea had been achieved, as in such
                            an event it is feared that some Governments, not only in the Communist
                            bloc but also in the free world, would be anxious to find a pretext for
                            discrediting the Chinese Government in order to pave the way for its
                            replacement in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> by the Peiping
                            regime. Since the U.S. Government will remain strongly opposed to the
                            seating of the Chinese Communists in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> and in favor of the retention of China’s seat by the
                            Chinese Government whether or not an armistice is achieved in Korea, it
                            would regard with deep concern any developments which might lead to a
                            serious weakening of the Chinese Government’s position in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Were the Chinese Communists to succeed
                            in establishing themselves in the United Nations at the expense of the
                            Chinese Government, it would seem indisputable that the Chinese
                            Communists’ gain in terms of political prestige and power in Southeast
                            Asia would far more than offset the advantages to the Chinese
                            Government, whatever they might be, of maintaining three or four
                            thousand troops in Burmese territory.</p>
                        <p>While it seems apparent from Embassy reports that the foregoing line of
                            reasoning is fully understood and accepted by the Foreign Minister and
                            his colleagues, their hands in the apparent struggle over this issue
                            within the Chinese Government might be strengthened if they were in a
                            position to make it clear that the U.S. Government is also deeply
                            concerned as to the possible consequences of deliberate defiance of the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> mandate with respect to <pb
                                n="107" xml:id="pg_107" facs="0127"/>the Chinese troops in Burma.
                            Unless the Embassy perceives objections, therefore, an appropriate
                            occasion should be taken to discuss this matter with the Foreign
                            Minister along the foregoing lines.<note n="1" xml:id="d74fn1">On June

                            of Salween River, prior to visit of Communists to Monghsat. Foreign

                        <p>Li Mi brought out his order of battle to demonstrate position of his
                            forces. He said it was impracticable for him to accept cease-fire and
                            safety zone in Monghsat area alone because of exposed position of his
                            troops in north wedged between Burmese white flag Communist troops and
                            Chinese Communist troops. The moment the news is broadcast of safety
                            zone encompassing his headquarters, he anticipates <pb n="110"

                            from both sides. Since his units are entirely supplied from Monghsat, he
                            regards it as impracticable to cut them off from their headquarters.</p>
                        <p>If Burmese deem it unfeasible to effect cease-fire throughout this
                            territory because they cannot control dissident groups, then Li Mi
                            suggested cease-fire east of Salween be subject to two conditions: <list>

                                <item>If his troops were attacked during cease-fire, they would

                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>His headquarters must have right to maintain logistical
                                    support of these units. However, he does not believe attack will
                                    come if cease-fire is general throughout area east of Salween,
                                    especially if conditions are made known since Communists will
                                    assume this northern area will fall into their hands like ripe

                                    because of dissident groups, Li Mi said if his proposal of
                                    cease-fire east of Salween were adopted, only one additional
                                    safety zone would have to be established at later stage west of
                                    Salween to enable his troops at Tangyang to withdraw.</item>

                        <p>It was apparent during conference that in matters of implementation
                            position of Chinese Government [will?] be largely determined by Li Mi.
                            It also seemed evident that he had reluctantly been convinced that
                            genuine effort must be made to evacuate his troops. He spoke of <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> decision and said he realized
                            international prestige of his government was at stake and would do his
                            utmost to cooperate, although he himself felt that the best solution was
                            to equip his troops and send them back to Yunnan.</p>
                        <p>Li Mi also urged that as soon as possible his own representative should
                            work directly with committee. He would like very much to be there
                            himself, he said, but his health still prevented. Although he looked in
                            pink of condition, keen, alert, bright-eyed, ready smile, he said his
                            doctors advised him it was still impossible for him to travel by plane.
                            His blood pressure frequently soared as much as thirty degrees in one
                            day, he said.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister reported he had only just received a translation of
                            American plan outlined in Bangkok’s 2365 to Department and had no
                            opportunity as yet to discuss it with other officials of his government.
                            I again urged that it was to the interest of his government to approve
                            the plan and obtained the impression that he himself saw no
                            objections—that the major hurdle was question of area involved in
                            initial cease-fire.</p>

                            Rangoon 120. Foreign Minister informed me today that Colonel I Fu-de was
                            scheduled return to Bangkok Friday and meanwhile every effort was being
                            exerted to clarify all doubtful points in negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, on points listed by reference telegram Chinese Government
                            was (1) willing to accept tentative US draft proposal as basis for
                            discussion (2) making earnest effort to work out mutually acceptable
                            cease-fire formula. Foreign Minister has recommended acceptance of
                            latest Burmese proposal (Bangkok’s reference telegram) which Li Mi now
                            studying. (3) working out with Li Mi practicable plan for obtaining
                            cooperation of his troops. (4) issuing instructions to Colonel I which
                            would enable him to move toward final solution.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister again assured me that Chinese Government was not
                            dragging its feet but that it must be certain that steps it takes do not
                            backfire resulting in accusations of bad faith. He said cease-fire area
                            question was not so difficult as various problems connected with the
                            actual withdrawal and disarming of troops, especially troops which might
                            refuse to obey order to evacuate. In this connection, he mentioned that
                            Li Mi does not consider Burmese representative would be safe in Mong
                            Hsat even under ceasefire arrangement unless all his troops were
                            disarmed.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister also raised one minor aspect of matter which should be
                            settled in connection with overall agreement. Burmese have in custody
                            several hundred Chinese soldiers and civilians who should be released
                            and evacuated simultaneously.</p>
                        <p>Finally he said that President Chiang in expressing his willingness to
                            cooperate fully in removal of troops from Burma, wished to re-emphasize
                            his previously stated position that Chinese Government could not be held
                            responsible for what it was unable to do and hoped that Burmese would
                            consider issue closed after termination Committee’s work.</p>

                            troops in Burma. Said approximately 1600 troops had entered Burma
                            originally and this number since reduced by casualties, other causes.
                            However, various arrangements had been made with Shan peoples, Was,
                            Mons, Kachins and Karens which resulted in organization larger forces
                            which he described as “allies”. Stressed anti-Communist ideology
                            purposes these forces. In his opinion United Nations resolution re
                            evacuation was illegal since no investigating commission had been sent
                            by United Nations to make study on ground before taking its “hasty”
                            action of last April, and in this connection he recalled despatch League
                            Nations Commission to Manchuria following Japanese aggression in 1931. …
                            Said “small” number might be willing go Taiwan and he himself and other
                            two officers willing go if ordered but they much concerned about leaving
                            behind local peoples with whom they allied. Finally, he read to us
                            declaration addressed to Secretary Dulles which he asked me to take to
                            Washington. In substance paper covered above points and set forth
                            conditions which have to do with far-reaching measures for protection by
                            Burmese Government of “allies” left behind.</p>
                        <p>In reply I attempted to set him straight, stressing sovereignty Burma and
                            significance of concerned United Nations action this problem. Emphasized
                            in particular great importance this matter to Chinese Government and
                            pointed out if no action taken, serious complications would arise
                            affecting not only their government but also their troops in Burma.
                            Urged them as patriotic soldiers China to come out and go to Taiwan
                            where they could participate more effectively in anti-Communist efforts
                            their government. I said not only impossible for Joint Committee discuss
                            political questions raised but also would be noted by US Government with
                            “pain”. Emphasized that evacuation is wish his government. Written
                            declaration with translation will be transmitted to Department. Urged
                            most strongly that they consider what he [<hi rend="italic">I</hi>?] had
                            said and prepare begin to move at least some of their troops since this

                            Clear evidence their conversation results physical and mental isolation
                            in Kengtung. Obvious General Li is spokesman for group. Also appears
                            from their remarks that General Li Mi somewhat in background and perhaps
                            of minor importance their thinking. Although foregoing sounds
                            discouraging it was to be expected that they would defend their action
                            and try make case for same. I may be mistaken but I feel that problem is
                            not hopeless and that after further <pb n="116" xml:id="pg_116"

                            finally able convince him such action absolutely out of question. While
                            visibly disturbed he accepted answer as final. I then emphasized vital
                            importance to his government that he carefully reflect on considerations
                            which we had placed before him. In course these remarks he repeated that
                            he and his associates here would themselves obey orders of Li Mi to go
                            to Formosa. While he refused to estimate how many others would accept
                            evacuation he did indicate that Chinese troops in Burma acknowledge
                            authority of Li Mi.</p>

                        <p>191. From Brown and Sebald. Following contains results our careful review
                            Joint Committee negotiations to date:</p>
                        <p>Three principal points remain for solution: Chinese civilian internee
                            problem; Thai unwillingness assume transport expenses; and whether
                            Chinese will agree evacuation, how many and when.</p>
                        <p>We believe first two problems can be settled by negotiation. Third
                            problem is crux of matter and we base our conclusions below on full
                            discussion with US representatives, Colonel I and Colonel Chatichai<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d85fn2">Col. Chatichai Choonhaven.</note> (Thai
                            representative).</p>
                        <p>On basis Chinese actions to date, we conclude deliberations of Committee
                            have now reached critical stage where further meetings will perforce be
                            primarily for purpose avoid complete breakdown. We have impression
                            Chinese Government has sent strawmen who lack authorization make firm
                            decisions and whose actions are inhibited by what appear to be
                            instructions to delay. One cannot help feel Chinese generals on one hand
                            and Taipei on other are throwing ball back and forth in endeavor
                            postpone positive action.</p>
                        <p>In meantime, as Department aware, Burmese are proceeding with plans for
                            presentation their report UNGA in September session. We, nevertheless,
                            believe it essential Committee continue its <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119"
                                facs="0139"/>deliberations, regardless how ineffective results might
                            be, until that time in order minimize possibility placing onus on US
                            Government for not having done utmost assist on good offices basis find
                            practical solution.</p>
                        <p>Taipei’s 45, last clause,<note n="3" xml:id="d85fn3">The last clause of
                                telegram 45, July 20, stated that, according to Foreign Minister
                                Yeh, Li Mi sent new instructions to Bangkok designating Li Wen-pin
                                as his representative and instructing the latter to carry out
                                President Chiang’s instructions to cooperate in withdrawing the
                                largest possible number of troops. (690B.9321/7–2053)</note>
                            suggests hopeful development but on basis previous similar assurances we
                            are not sanguine these instructions will be carried out or
                            wholeheartedly followed by local Chinese representatives. It seems to us
                            problem cannot be solved unless some more effective means found by
                            Chinese Government enforce its stated policy. We suggest President
                            Chiang’s orders given either to Li Mi or to jungle generals through
                            Colonel I as Chinese Government representative be unmistakably firm and
                            clear that Committee’s evacuation plan must be complied with to maximum
                            possible extent. Should this fail, Department might wish consider
                            requesting Chinese Government completely disavow any connection
                            whatsoever with so-called <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troops in
                            Burma.</p>
                        <p>We are gratified with excellent and persistent work performed Colonel
                            Palmer and US Army members his representation. We believe that they have
                            done everything which can be done bring about solution but that they
                            must have stronger political support vis-à-vis Chinese Government.</p>

                        <p>89. I called on Acting Foreign Minister Kyaw Nyein late yesterday at his
                            request discuss <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> problem. Kyaw Nyein
                            asked what I learned on my visit Bangkok, saying <gloss target="#t_GUB1"
                                >GUB</gloss> feels committee unable make further progress. I
                            explained complexity of situation on Chinese side in view some
                            divergence opinion between [Chinese] government represented by Colonel
                            I, jungle generals and General Li Wen-pin. Some delays inevitable but
                            assured him all interested parties doing everything possible convince
                                <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> leaders accept and <pb n="120"
                                xml:id="pg_120" facs="0140"/>implement agreement formulated by
                            committee. Also mentioned minor difficulties pertaining Chinese civilian
                            internees and apportionment costs.</p>
                        <p>Kyaw Nyein said latter two problems appeared not difficult but real
                            question was whether Chinese Government sincerely cooperating in
                            endeavor repatriate troops. Said <gloss target="#t_GUB1">GUB</gloss>
                            firmly convinced Chinese Government has cleverly given appearance doing
                            everything possible assist but in fact has made decision not withdraw
                            troops. In consequence he was thinking advising National Defense Council
                            (which met last night) announce deadline to committee for implementation
                            agreement failing which Burmese representative would withdraw. Felt
                                <gloss target="#t_GUB1">GUB</gloss> should simultaneously issue
                            public statement its conclusion re failure Chinese Government
                            cooperate.</p>
                        <p>I said my conclusions re situation was one of subdued optimism as I felt
                            committee just beginning come to grips with problem repatriation and
                            that further time required convince <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss>
                            leaders implement agreement. Should <gloss target="#t_GUB1">GUB</gloss>
                            withdraw from committee all hope for solution would disappear.
                            Consequently I felt it essential Burmese representative continue assist
                            other committee members in resolving problem. Also strongly advised
                            against public statement. Kyaw Nyein countered by saying UNGA being
                            convened mid-September and that sooner or later decision must be reached
                            re Burmese preparation of report in accordance <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> resolution. As little time left he felt necessary set
                            time limit. I reiterated further arguments as above and suggested
                            withdrawal from committee would be tactical error. I feel he will
                            respond favorably and that Burma will not withdraw.</p>
                        <p>Continuing, Kyaw Nyein said he felt it necessary <gloss target="#t_GUB1"
                                >GUB</gloss> plan ahead as it now appears probable even after report
                            to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMTs</gloss> will not have withdrawn. Said he
                            had been thinking in terms making some sort arrangement with <gloss
                                target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss>, perhaps “non-aggression pact” under
                            which <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> would assist <gloss
                                target="#t_GUB1">GUB</gloss> in driving out <gloss target="#t_KMT1"
                                >KMTs</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> doing the
                            fighting in connivance with Burmese Army. I asked who would then drive
                            out Chinese Communist troops to which he replied “we would if necessary
                            appeal <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and start merry-go-round all
                            over again”.</p>
                        <p>I said this was dangerous line of thought and felt sure he knew it to be
                            so. I hoped he was not speaking seriously. He replied was entirely
                            serious but had not and would not make this proposal to his colleagues
                            at present time. He thought, however, that out of desperation if
                            committee and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> failed something must be
                            done.</p>
                        <p>I again counselled utmost patience and continuation negotiations which
                            must of necessity break down should Burmese delegate withdraw and
                            assured him US doing everything possible insure success committee’s work
                            to which Kyaw Nyein said <gloss target="#t_GUB1">GUB</gloss> most
                            appreciative <pb n="121" xml:id="pg_121" facs="0141"/>efforts US
                            Government but unfortunately logic of situation is such US probably gone
                            as far as it can vis-à-vis Taipei Government and still has obtained no
                            positive results.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> I do not take too seriously Kyaw Nyein’s
                            remarks re accommodation with <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> in
                            view his known stand against communism and all it represents. However it
                            is possible his remarks reflect thinking some his Cabinet colleagues …
                            and for this reason suggested line of action if <gloss target="#t_KMT1"
                                >KMT</gloss> problem not resolved should not be entirely dismissed.
                            Kyaw Nyein has previously been entirely frank and honest with me and I
                            believe he is shrewd enough realize he cannot impress me with remarks
                            that could so easily be construed as pressure.</p>

                            Burmese envisage building defense forces to point where (a) they could

                            training and development maintenance facilities.</p>
                        <p>During past week complete and frank discussions concerning lists have
                            been held on service level with <gloss target="#t_BSM1">BSM</gloss>.
                            General impressions gained by three Attachés is that <gloss
                                target="#t_BSM1">BSM</gloss> adopting completely negative attitude
                            toward Burmese aspirations that British will advance view Burmese
                            requests are inflated, impractical and ridiculous and that <gloss
                                target="#t_GUB1">GUB</gloss> should be unable maintain desired
                            equipment. It also appears probable <gloss target="#t_BSM1">BSM</gloss>
                            will delay its recommendations to us for formulation final list until
                            some decision reached with Burmese re new <gloss target="#t_BSM1"
                                >BSM</gloss> agreement.</p>
                        <p>As we see British attitude toward question it reflects basic desire limit
                            strengthening Burmese armed forces for various political reasons. We
                            therefore believe it unlikely any satisfactory solution can be reached
                            at service level and consider problem political one requiring high level
                            Anglo-American agreement on mutual objectives this area.</p>
                        <p>Burmese War Office has informally indicated desire (1) increase number
                            trainees US service schools and (2) obtain US technicians work with
                            Burmese forces for training and maintenance instruction for American
                            equipment which they hope purchase. We also believe Burma does not
                            desire continue <gloss target="#t_BSM1">BSM</gloss> as such and that any
                            new agreement with <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would be on limited
                            scale and based on concept similar (2) above. It appears clear that
                                <gloss target="#t_GUB1">GUB</gloss> desires disentangle self from
                            dependence upon British its armed forces for training and supply and
                            that they greatly prefer closer cooperation with US this regard being
                            convinced only US able assist them build their forces to adequate
                            strength. From Burmese viewpoint arrangement with British been
                            unfortunate and unsatisfactory and they have time and again evinced
                            considerable impatience and frustration with <gloss target="#t_BSM1"
                                >BSM</gloss> in attempting obtain what they consider minimum support
                            on reimbursable basis.</p>
                        <p>We foresee considerable danger to our friendly relations with Burma
                            should Burmese approach to US be unproductive. Should Burmese be
                            rebuffed in their endeavor strengthen armed forces through US or British
                            the possibility exists they might approach Communist bloc to exclusion
                            both <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and US. At same time we are aware
                            danger Burmese playing British against US and vice versa. We consider it
                            important that we avoid appearance of undercutting British or
                            encouraging Burmese discontinue <gloss target="#t_BSM1">BSM</gloss>
                            which as indicated above we believe will in any case be discontinued.
                            However, we believe it essential in interest of free world that US or
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> take immediate steps strengthen

                                    determination bring about maximum troop withdrawal. Chinese
                                    Government also obtained assurance these leaders will “exercise
                                    utmost efforts to bring about desired evacuation.” Li Tse-fen
                                    will return Bangkok soon to participate in four power conference
                                    and work out feasible plan for evacuation. As far as Chinese
                                    Government concerned question of civilian internees only problem
                                    remaining be solved before over-all agreement can be reached.
                                    Chinese Government originally proposed and still believes these
                                    civilians should be released. Yet Chinese Government willing in

                                    be dealt with according Burmese law. In opinion Chinese
                                    Government this question clearly within competence committee
                                    because without presence Li Mi forces these overseas Chinese
                                    would not have been interned. (They are charged with

                                    him supplies.) Hence Chinese Government urges US Government

                            of these places from paragraph 5a (11) of agreement can only be viewed
                            as another delaying tactic. This move, coupled with fact that Chinese

                            departure of the Burmese Delegation to the 8th Session of the United
                            Nations where they will have to report on the presence of the Kuomintang
                            troops in our country. I take the opportunity of sending you this letter
                            in order that a correct perspective of the situation prevailing, and a
                            true appreciation of Burmese feelings, may be made known to you.</p>
                        <p>I shall not reiterate in detail the events of the past beyond stating
                            that the remnants of the Chinese Army of 1942, who managed to survive
                            Japanese attempts at their annihilation in the outlying parts of Burma,
                            were joined by the Chinese Army that retreated from Yunnan in 1949. They
                            have been living on the land much to the discomfort and danger of the
                            unfortunate inhabitants.</p>
                        <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0156"/>
                        <p>Due to clever propaganda the opinion gained ground that these people
                            might form the nucleus of an army that would one day enter China through
                            Yunnan. It began in this manner and much from American sources went to
                            them. As was expected of them, they did make a foray into Yunnan in 1951
                            with disastrous results to themselves. Since this set-back, in order to
                            justify their existence, they have been propagandising themselves as an
                            army of liberation but they liberate none and these desperate men in
                            reality trade in opium and resort to killing our nationals for their
                            small possessions and their hard grown grain. Our women have suffered as
                            may well be expected.</p>
                        <p>It must be apparent to all by now that, as a force to enter China, these
                            troops can in no way be useful or be effective. All that they have
                            achieved is to make the people of the country suffer. They have been
                            selling the arms that have been given to them by interested parties, to
                            the local insurgents who pay for them with the monies that they had
                            looted from the treasuries of the Burmese Government. This trade in
                            arms, together with their monopoly in opium have made their leaders very
                            rich, and at the same time they are ready suppliers of arms to the
                            insurgents.</p>
                        <p>We have been combating them but preoccupied as we are with our local
                            insurgents we have not been able to give them the attention that would
                            end in their liquidation. At least they could be contained in a remote
                            sector of Burma while we battle with the insurgents, who if they are
                            victorious, could align Burma with the Communist Bloc.</p>
                        <p>We have tried our hardest not to involve anybody in our difficulties and
                            it was for this reason that we suffered in silence and took no action
                            apart from approaching the American Embassy at Rangoon to exercise
                            pressure on the authorities at Formosa. That help came but there was no
                            result. The situation became desperate especially with a powerful
                            neighbour who might look upon the situation as one that calls for
                            retaliatory and defensive action. We thus had to bring the matter to the
                            United Nations.</p>
                        <p>As a member country of the United Nations, dedicated to peace, we bowed
                            to the will of the majority and prayed hard that some measure of relief
                            would emerge. Talks have taken place at Bangkok and much help has been
                            received from the American and Thai representatives as well as from the
                            American Ambassadors at Taipei, Bangkok and Rangoon, for which I express
                            the thanks of the Burmese people. However, as times goes on, we are
                            forced to the conclusion that the Chinese are not sincere, and even if
                            they had some vague intention of carrying out the decision of the United
                            Nations at the outset, the position for them has changed <pb n="137"
                                xml:id="pg_137" facs="0157"/>after the precedent created by Mr.
                            Syngman Rhee<note n="2" xml:id="d96fn2">President of the Republic of
                                Korea.</note> in Korea. The Burmese are now forced to adopt the
                            belief that Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek will drive as hard a bargain
                            as Mr. Rhee.</p>
                        <p>My personal belief which is shared by many, is that, left to the United
                            Nations and to governments, no satisfactory solution will result. I
                            cannot help but feel that your personal intervention would make the
                            chances of success far greater and I therefore request your help in
                            order that the matter may be settled in the course of the present
                            session of the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>Eminent American nationals have come to Burma and I have no doubt that
                            you have received reports about this country from them. We have no
                            secret pacts or secret understandings with any country and our policy is
                            to avoid involvement. Our greatest task has been the fight against the
                            spread of communism in our own country. You will perhaps recall that at
                            one stage in our short life as an independent nation, we were almost
                            written off by the democracies as pseudo communists or
                            fellow-travellers. Perhaps at that time there was justification for the
                            view but since then we have travelled far and we have battled against
                            the tendency even to lean towards communism, and we feel gratified that
                            in our own way we have combatted it and that today we are on much firmer
                            ground, away from the morass of communism. And we continue to fight the
                            good fight, in our own way, to be entirely rid of the danger. It would
                            indeed be lamentable if because of our necessity to repel the Kuomintang
                            invader, we must lessen our vigilance against the spread of the far
                            greater danger.</p>
                        <p>We emerged as an independent nation in 1948 with the goodwill of all
                            countries including that of the United States of America. Our
                            relationship has been cordial and the help rendered to us by your great
                            country has been immense. It is a matter of deep regret to us that we
                            had to terminate the aid agreement which was of the greatest material
                            benefit towards the rehabilitation of our war-devastated country, but
                            such termination was compelled by the need to combat the insidious
                            propaganda that we could not complain about the presence of Kuomintang
                            troops because of the acceptance of American aid. The suggestion, to
                            intelligent people, was fantastic, but unfortunately intelligent people
                            everywhere are in a minority, and thus we had to adopt the extreme
                            course of declining the aid solely in order to show to the masses that
                            our conscience is clear and our hands clean. The greatest difficulty we
                            encounter is to meet the argument that the Chinese are defying the
                            United Nations as well as world opinion because the United States of
                            America does not wish them really to leave Burma. The average Burmese
                                <pb n="138" xml:id="pg_138" facs="0158"/>knows only that the
                            government at Formosa cannot exist without American aid, and thus he
                            cannot understand why Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek can defy the United
                            States of America, and he therefore concludes readily that attempts at
                            evacuation are all sham. The battle among ourselves has been hard;
                            feelings have been embittered, and at one stage to forestall and
                            neutralise communist propaganda we were nearly forced to seek a

                            counsel prevailed.</p>

                            that real strong action on the part of the United States of America
                            would bring about a solution, and because of this belief I appeal to you
                            as a God fearing and righteous man, and as one who can and has
                            contributed much to the preservation of world peace, to use your good
                            influence that would make these unwanted people leave our country and
                            thereby gain the gratitude of a long suffering people.</p>

                        <p>1166. Rangoon’s 178, August 27 to Department. In recent conversations at
                            Foreign Office Embassy has, without elaborating on US policy, endeavored
                            probe British thinking on arms procurement for Burma. Foreign Office
                            seems hold to view that Ward has been able revitalize <gloss
                                target="#t_BSM1">BSM</gloss> and that it now operating fairly
                            smoothly and effectively, with increasing support of Burmese military.
                            Foreign Office has often mentioned impractical nature some of Burmese
                            requisitions with emphasis on jet aircraft and tanks at expense
                            equipment <pb n="142" xml:id="pg_142" facs="0162"/>for highly mobile
                            infantry capable of out-fighting and out-maneuvering rebels in guerrilla
                            warfare. Doubtless there is some resentment over existence of
                            substantial Burmese holdings in foreign exchange due to Burmese refusal
                            to settle financial obligations to British.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> believes it to our interest as well as
                            theirs to attempt so far as practicable deter Burmese from squandering
                            their exchange on gadgets and concentrate on building up military
                            machine consonant with their needs. Although concerned over failure
                                <gloss target="#t_GUB1">GUB</gloss> respond more frankly to British
                            overtures for extension <gloss target="#t_BSM1">BSM</gloss> agreement,
                            Foreign Office has received interim reply which “not too discouraging”
                            and which is now being studied. Foreign Office aware Burmese, in
                            avoiding precise stand on renewal <gloss target="#t_BSM1">BSM</gloss>
                            agreement, may be exploring other possible sources military training and
                            equipment and attempting play off <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            against US and perhaps other nations.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Office appears to feel that <gloss target="#t_GUB1">GUB</gloss>
                            not too firmly in saddle, that control by pro-Western elements is
                            somewhat precarious, and that majority of politicians are “neutralists”
                            and suspicious Western intentions. They question whether it would be
                            helpful supply present administration with expensive equipment which
                            Burmese do not need, which they cannot adequately maintain, and the
                            purchase of which would deplete their foreign exchange which could be
                            put to better use. If present administration overthrown, they fear
                            equipment supplied would not be used in Western interests.</p>
                        <p>Embassy assumes Department will wish prior intimate discussion this
                            problem with <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> before reached decision
                            supply training and equipment to Burma. However tactful US approach,
                            British bound resent US participation and competition in field
                            heretofore largely monopolized by <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>.
                            British tend regard Burma as one of few remaining spheres of interest in
                                <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>, and they might feel US
                            attempting ease them out of picture. Perhaps, solution would be for
                                <gloss target="#t_GUB1">GUB</gloss>, US, and <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> consult jointly with view working out acceptable minor
                            role for US to play—e.g., furnish <gloss target="#t_GUB1">GUB</gloss> at
                            cost price and with British acquiescence, limited quantity matériel of
                            which <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> in short supply and which three
                            participants agree would be useful and desirable.</p>
                        <p>This situation raises fundamental question for US policy. British are
                            still willing and even anxious to carry principal responsibility for
                            arming some countries such as Burma and certain Arab States. They feel,
                            however, that US world power and prestige are now too overwhelming that
                            in order for them successfully to carry out this responsibility we must
                            clearly indicate, and support by our actions, that we consider British
                            have primary responsibility and that we are not to be played off against
                            them. Once we start to play active <pb n="143" xml:id="pg_143"
                                facs="0163"/>and independent role in giving military assistance to a
                            country, we undermine already sadly depleted British prestige to point
                            that British no longer able to carry effectively significant share of
                            burden. Any such development, in Embassy opinion, would be short-sighted
                            and not in best interests of US. Far better results, with less cost and
                            minimum political responsibility, could be gained through exercise our
                            influence indirectly through or in junior partnership with British in
                            such areas as Burma. This follows not only from possibility obtaining
                            independent contribution British resources in such cases, but also from
                            greater acceptability policies backed by joint US–<gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> sponsorship and from reassurance against fear of
                            domination, which is inescapable element in relation less developed
                            areas to largest world power center.</p>
                        <p>We assume this consideration obtaining maximum US policy results with
                            economy in direct commitment US resources especially relevant under
                            current conditions of budgetary pressure and heavy burdens required by
                            present US obligations, creating presumption against additional
                            commitments, and that we would, therefore, welcome opportunity of
                            encouraging British to retain primary responsibility in such countries
                            as Burma. Our policies toward and relations with British regarding these
                            countries must then be very different from those toward Greece and
                            Turkey, for example.</p>
                        <p>We fully realize that this situation poses unusually difficult problems
                            for US missions who, despite fact that they are representing greatest
                            power center in free world and in face of local desires for more
                            intimate and direct relationship with US, must to some extent play
                            second fiddle to less powerful nations. This means resisting the
                            temptation, for example, to supply unilaterally arms to Iraq as
                            suggested at recent RECNE Cairo meeting (bottom of page 3 and top of
                            page 4, minutes of meeting).<note n="1" xml:id="d100fn1">Reference is to

                            prestige and to avoid further expansion direct US commitments and

                                memorandum received that day from Foreign Minister Yeh. The
                                memorandum stated that: (1) China was ready to sign the Four-Power
                                Agreement and the evacuation plan with or without Burma’s signature;
                                (2) since the Chinese Government exercised no control over Li Mi’s
                                troops it could not order them to leave Burma; (3) the Chinese
                                Government estimated that 1,500–2,000 troops, plus several hundred
                                dependents would be evacuated; (4) the Chinese Government vouched
                                for the intention of Li Mi’s forces to evacuate the six bases
                                mentioned in the evacuation plan, provided that the Burmese
                                Government, whether or not it signed the agreement, abided by its
                                terms; and (5) Li Mi promised to dissolve his Yunnan Anti-Communist
                                National Salvation Army as soon as those troops who were willing had
                                been evacuated, and the Chinese Government would thereafter make a
                                statement that all those choosing to remain in Burma did so at their
                                own risk. In the meantime, orders were being issued to the Chinese
                                representative on the Joint Committee to make a formal statement in
                                accordance with the above. (690B.9321/9–2253)</note> to Department
                            today, Foreign Minister late yesterday had orally out-lined <pb n="146"

                            expressed view it did not go far enough to satisfy requirements of
                            situation and desires of my government. I made following points.</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>I hoped that Chinese Government would review proposed estimate of
                                evacuees in endeavor to raise it substantially. Foreign Minister
                                replied both he and Generalissimo had urged that estimate be fixed
                                at 3,000, but advisers who had been in Burma doubted larger estimate
                                could be met and President did not wish to promise anything he was
                                not certain of being able to fulfill.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Nowhere in the memorandum, I pointed out, was any mention made of
                                orders to troops to evacuate and I regarded it as vital for Chinese
                                Government to establish firmly the fact that orders had been issued
                                to this effect. Foreign Minister repeated previously stated position
                                of Chinese Government on this point to effect that it had always
                                maintained it had no jurisdiction over these troops, but added that
                                in point of fact orders had been issued through Li Mi and that as
                                many as thirty messages had been sent to the “jungle generals”
                                instructing them to bend every effort to induce as many as possible
                                to come out. I remarked that it would be extremely helpful if copies
                                of some of these orders and instructions could be made available.
                                Foreign Minister replied that they had been issued through office of
                                Chief of Staff, but he would endeavor to provide with copies.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>I regarded as weak statement as to status of troops left behind
                                since Chinese Government made no commitment regarding its own future
                                action. I believed the statement in its present form would be
                                regarded as dodging issue of relationship between Chinese Government
                                and Chinese who stayed behind Burma.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Foreign Minister requested that these and any other points I had be put
                            in memorandum form, to which I agreed.</p>

                            emphasizes fundamental difference between present British approach and
                            that which appears from this vantage point demanded by both American and
                            British policy objectives in this formerly colonial area. Entire concept
                            of spheres influence reminiscent of gunboat diplomacy and implies
                            tutelary paternalism of colonial power. Resentment of continued British
                            attempt wield such power is at heart of present <gloss target="#t_BSM1"
                                >BSM</gloss> problem and at same time in direct proportion to our
                            support such British attitude it will undermine US political and
                            strategic interest here.</p>
                        <p>Essential clarify two apparent misconceptions reference telegram. We
                            believe: (a) Ward has not been able revitalize <gloss target="#t_BSM1"
                                >BSM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_BSM1">BSM</gloss> is not now
                            operating with increased support; (b) <gloss target="#t_GUB1"
                                >GUB</gloss> is firmly in the saddle and though majority of
                            political leaders are indeed “neutralists” they are noticeably less
                            suspicious Western objectives than is general rule among Arab-Asian
                            group.</p>
                        <p>It is, of course, not in our interest to weaken prestige of British in
                            Burma nor replace them in position of proctorship. On contrary, from our
                            point of view, it is most regrettable that British have exhausted their
                            once ample reservoir of prestige in Burma through their propensity to
                            use their preferred position as lever with which to exercise measure of
                            control over these highly nationalistic people. British do not appear
                            realize active resentment caused by this practice nor associate it with
                            Burmese firm intention terminate <gloss target="#t_BSM1">BSM</gloss> in
                            present form.</p>
                        <p>If this resentment were directed solely against British, it would not
                            concern us so much but <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and US are so
                            closely associated in Burma that feelings against British also affect
                            their attitude toward us especially when we appear connive in effort
                            continue British control.</p>
                        <p>We agree that some Burmese requests are unrealistic and that effort
                            should be made discourage purchase of expensive equipment which they
                            cannot effectively use. We believe, however, that this can be done
                            without compulsion and that final controlling factor <pb n="150"
                                xml:id="pg_150" facs="0170"/>should be Burmese shortage of foreign
                            exchange rather than outright refusal to sell.</p>
                        <p>My service attachés are satisfied that Burmese armed forces could
                            effectively use much more equipment and supplies than British are
                            allowing them have and it is our opinion that strengthening these forces
                            would add to defensive capacity of free world. We believe in capacity
                            present government maintain itself in power and are convinced that
                            recognition of equality implicit in granting to Burma final say as to
                            nature and amounts of equipment to be purchased would increase
                            observable sympathy for West and that added ability liquidate Communist
                            insurgents which increased purchases would presumably entail would
                            enhance security this strategic area.</p>
                        <p>Question whether arms are supplied by <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            or US is not as important as whether they are to be supplied at all. It,
                            therefore, appears that we should first seek convince British of wisdom
                            of substantial increase in supplies. We agree that intimate discussion
                            of this problem with British is essential and that agreement should be
                            reached as to items on pending list to be supplied by respective
                            governments. We do not believe <gloss target="#t_GUB1">GUB</gloss> would
                            agree participate in tripartite discussions. Fact that <gloss
                                target="#t_GUB1">GUB</gloss> has approached US on this matter under
                            clear provision of American law and that request could be refused only
                            for apparent reason that we supporting British coercive policies should
                            be kept in mind in determining extent our participation.</p>
                        <p>We should bear in mind that first approach for arms assistance in instant
                            case was not made by US but by Burma. As previously pointed out, basis
                            this action was deep-seated smouldering dissatisfaction by Burma with
                            British procurement policy which was implemented in such manner as to
                            result in interference with internal affairs of Burma. By lending
                            ourselves to continuation this state of affairs, we gratuitously offend
                            Burma’s aspirations for freedom of action, lend credence to charges of
                            American support for colonial practices by metropolitan powers and
                            discard opportunity demonstrate avowed American desire assist free Asian
                            countries maintain their freedom in face Communist pressures.</p>
                        <p>While we unable comment whether US as leading world power should or
                            should not take on added burdens, we believe Burma, as well as other
                            free nation in face Communist menace, is already inescapably burden of
                            US. It does not appear to us, however, that reimbursable arms
                            procurement in relatively modest proportions requested by Burma adds
                            and/or appreciably changes that burden. On contrary, strengthening of
                            Burmese defense forces by US sale of sorely needed equipment would seem
                            to us be on positive side of ledger.</p>
                        <pb n="151" xml:id="pg_151" facs="0171"/>
                        <p>Notwithstanding doubts expressed by British Foreign Office re Burmese
                            reliability in case of need, we are convinced Burma would fight against
                            any aggressor in endeavor maintain its independence. Further, such
                            doubts if well founded can only be dispelled and Burma’s pro-Western
                            orientation strengthened by sympathetic assistance, understanding and
                            reasonable response to Burma’s problems and needs. It is precisely in
                            matter of arms procurement where US can demonstrate its desire see Burma
                            free strong and sovereign.</p>
                        <p>Problem, therefore, appears to us to be one of coordinated assistance by
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and US with foregoing
                            considerations as objective. Solution, it seems, is not to be found in
                            one or other of two powers taking sole responsibility even if that were
                            possible or necessary but rather in approaching Burma’s needs from
                            viewpoint of its potential contribution to the cause of free world.</p>

                            letter of September twelfth, and thank you for your frank expression of
                            Burmese views regarding the presence of foreign forces in Burma. I am
                            indeed aware of the importance of a solution to this problem, and I have
                            been most anxious that the efforts being made to help your country
                            resolve it should prove fruitful.</p>
                        <p>In our discussions with President Chiang Kai-shek concerning the matter
                            we have found that he shares our conviction regarding the importance of
                            removing these foreign troops from Burmese soil. In view of your letter
                            I am sending President Chiang a personal message,<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d106fn2"><ref target="#d107"><hi rend="italic"
                                    >Infra</hi></ref>.</note> reiterating my interest in the problem
                            and my sense of the urgency of a solution insofar as this is within the
                            power of the Chinese Government.</p>
                        <p>The limitations to action which can be taken by that Government must also
                            be realistically recognized, and I trust that your representative’s
                            withdrawal from the Bangkok talks will not militate against such
                            recognition and thus defer the reaching of a practical <pb n="152"
                                xml:id="pg_152" facs="0172"/>solution. Although President Chiang and
                            his Government are now striving to bring about the evacuation of these
                            troops it has become evident that their control over a portion of them
                            is small indeed. While a limited group appears disposed to accept
                            repatriation there is little more that can be done, either by President
                            Chiang or through international action, to force the remainder to join
                            an evacuation movement.</p>
                        <p>I am sure that in writing you I need not insist on the fact that
                            allegations to the effect that the United States Government does not
                            really wish these troops to leave Burma are totally without foundation,
                            and are designed merely to sow dissent and suspicion between our two
                            nations.</p>
                        <p>I should like to take this opportunity to express my sincere admiration
                            for the manner in which you and your colleagues have dedicated
                            yourselves to repairing the ravages of war and insurrection, and to
                            congratulate you on your progress in realizing a strong and independent
                            Burma. I particularly welcome your remarks on your attitude toward the
                            menace of communism. You may be assured of the continued friendly
                            interest of the United States as you move forward to the goals which you
                            have set for your country.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: I have been following
                            closely the international efforts which have been under way for some
                            time to bring about a solution of the serious problem created by the
                            presence of the Chinese irregular forces in Burma. I am confident that
                            you share my concern that these efforts be successful. I am now writing
                            to you personally regarding this matter because I feel that the time has
                            come when concrete results must be produced if this problem is to be
                            resolved at all. While recognizing that there are limits on the degree
                            of influence which your Government exercises over the forces in Burma, I
                            feel that this fact should not deter you from utilizing your influence
                            to the maximum to bring about immediately <pb n="153" xml:id="pg_153"

                            sympathy or support. Unless such concrete results can be achieved, I
                            fear that a situation will be created which the communists will not fail
                            to exploit to their advantage and to the detriment of both your
                            Government and the Burmese Government.</p>

                            Chinese and other Governments can take to resolve the problem.</p>
                        <p>You may be assured that the United States will continue to strive for an
                            early solution of this problem acceptable to all Governments concerned,
                            but in doing so it must rely on the sincere and wholehearted cooperation
                            of such Governments. In the light of the close and cordial relationships
                            which exist between our two Governments, I am confident that I can count

                                of any kind; and (4) the Chinese Government called attention to

                                Mong Hsat and requested the U.S. representative on the Joint

                        <p>In presenting letter to Ambassador Koo, Robertson stressed necessity
                            Chinese Government’s making strongest possible case in <gloss

                            troops which ignored its recommendation to leave Burma. While

                            indicated Chinese Government should exert efforts get more out if
                            possible and abandon all six bases. He also pointed out necessity
                            issuance unequivocal public statement at highest level setting target

                            would cable it Taipei immediately.</p>
                        <p>Said his Government already had substantially agreed to our request in
                            memo last week to Embassy Taipei. Said not more than 2,000 troops in
                            Burma come from Yunnan. Others were natives Burma side border who joined
                            Li Mi. Said Chinese Government proposed evacuate 2,000 plus several
                            hundred dependents by air from northern Thailand in 10 day period
                            beginning October 5. He urged us influence Burmese refrain from current
                            air attacks Li Mi forces Monghsat. Said such attacks not only make
                            evacuation difficult if not impossible but also naturally infuriated Li
                            Mi forces and made them less likely heed withdrawal advice. Implied

                                19. Telegram 552 from Bangkok, Sept. 21, reported the Sept. 19
                                statement as follows: (1) 1,500–2,000 troops plus several hundred
                                dependents were prepared to evacuate; (2) if Burma refused to accept
                                the estimate, China wished to carry out the evacuation as long as
                                Burma did not interfere; (3) after the evacuees withdrew, the
                                remainder would be no concern of the Chinese Government; and (4)
                                Burma’s demands of Sept. 16 were beyond the competence of the
                                Chinese Government. (690B.9321/92153) The Chinese statement of Sept.
                                30 was reported in telegram 621 from Bangkok, Oct. 1, as follows:
                                (1) The first group of evacuees could cross the Thai border within a
                                week of the arrival of the evacuation teams at the border provided
                                that Burma did not interfere with the operation; (2) the Chinese
                                Government would guarantee the evacuation of the six bases agreed
                                upon earlier by the Joint Committee provided that Burma followed the
                                procedure laid down in that agreement (see <ref target="#d95"
                                    >Document 95</ref>); (3) the Chinese Government had no intention
                                of perpetuating the existence of Li Mi’s forces in Burma by
                                furnishing them with supplies of any kind; and (4) the Chinese
                                Government requested the Joint Committee to ask the Burmese
                                Government to cease immediately its attacks on Li Mi’s troops.

                                transmitted in telegram 223 from Taipei, Oct. 8. The letter stated
                                that: (1) The Chinese Government had secured the consent of the
                                leaders of the Chinese irregular forces in Burma to evacuate 2,000
                                officers and men, together with their dependents; (2) the Chinese
                                Government would continue its sincere cooperation in any evacuation
                                scheme agreeable to all the concerned governments; and (3) it would
                                not maintain any relation with or give any support to those troops
                                who remained in Burma, but the Burmese Air Force had been bombing
                                the points where the troops were concentrating for evacuation and
                                that this had rendered actual movement of the evacuees almost
                                impossible. (690B.9321/10–853)</note> This statement, he said, had
                            been drafted and included most of points in Department’s telegram. He
                            would review matter carefully and give sympathetic consideration to
                            points not included.</p>
                        <p>He raised question as to why there was necessity of repeating reference
                            to six bases since that had been agreed in Bangkok. I responded that
                            failure to make such reference might be misunderstood and since Chinese
                            Government had agreed to turn over these bases, I saw no objection from
                            his standpoint to making such reference. On the other hand, I urged this
                            was the time for the Chinese Government to make as strong a public
                            commitment as possible in order to strengthen its international position

                            Burmese for breakdown of negotiations should they refuse to permit
                            implementation of Chinese proposals. Foreign Minister indicated he was
                            convinced and would include reference to bases.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister then said he had received a telegram yesterday from
                            General Liu Yuen-lin, most loyal and reliable of the Generals now in
                            Mong Hsat, to effect that reaction to bombings and artillery attack by
                            Burmese was most unfortunate from standpoint of evacuation program.
                            Eighty individuals who had agreed to evacuate were killed and resentment
                            was rising which might result in others refusing to leave. Chinese

                            the Chinese Government for its failure to induce a larger number of
                            Chinese irregulars to evacuate Burma he would, however, have to make it
                            clear that this number fell well below Burmese expectations and that the
                            problem posed to Burma by the presence of foreign troops still remained
                            essentially unchanged, that is to say, that whereas previously there
                            were 12,000 irregulars who had to be dealt with, there would now still
                            be 10,000. He would, therefore, voice the hope that efforts would
                            continue to be made to induce additional irregulars to leave Burma. He
                            would have to make it clear that in Burmese eyes the Chinese Government
                            had not fulfilled the obligations set forth in the last Assembly
                            resolution and that this problem could not be regarded as having been
                            solved. The Chinese Government should not be permitted <pb n="166"
                                xml:id="pg_166" facs="0186"/>to consider this initial step as
                            terminating the affair and closing the case.</p>
                        <p>So far as the November 15 date mentioned in the press release is
                            concerned, U Myint Thein said that, of course, his Government was
                            prepared to grant an extension if, as seems probable, additional time is
                            required in order to carry out a bona fide evacuation. He would make
                            this clear in the Committee if the question is raised.</p>
                        <p>U Myint Thein again repeated that he would not present any resolution nor
                            would he encourage any move on the part of members of the Asian-African
                            group to put forward a resolution.</p>

                        <p>Between October 31 and November 5, the First Committee of the United
                            Nations General Assembly considered Burma’s complaint concerning the
                            presence of foreign forces in Burmese territory. On November 5,
                            Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Mexico, New Zealand, and the United
                            Kingdom submitted a draft resolution providing that the First Committee
                            should adjourn further consideration of this question to a date not
                            earlier than November 23. (<gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> document
                            A/C.1/L.73) The First Committee adopted this resolution on November 5 by
                            50 votes to 3, with abstentions. United States Representative Archibald
                            J. Carey, Jr., stated that the United States Delegation abstained in
                            view of the role the United States Government had played in the past and
                            the possibility that the parties concerned might wish the United States
                            to continue to exercise its good offices. For the record of the

                                reported that he witnessed the arrival of a Chinese detachment at
                                the evacuation center the previous day. Lt. Gen. Lu Kuo-ch’uan,
                                Commander of the 28th Army, told Donovan that until a few days
                                before, he had 2,000 men in his command but that all but 450 were
                                taken from him by the “Mong Hsat Committee.”
                                (690B.9321/11–1853)</note> raises fundamental questions whether (a)
                            present evacuation is not in fact smokescreen for continuation <gloss
                                target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> operations in Burma; (b) Li Mi possibly
                            aided and abetted by certain segments Chinese Government proposes keep
                            control over those remaining with view continuing nefarious operations
                            in Burma and Thailand including opium smuggling racket.</p>
                        <p>It appears me time has arrived when US Government should squarely face
                            issue whether it should continue bear brunt criticisms over this affair
                            in Burma in particular and <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> in

                            bringing about reasonable solution. Argument that Chiang has no
                            influence over Li Mi and thus over <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss>’s
                            is patently transparent. Key to problem appears lie in Chiang’s hands
                            who could if he would I believe cleanse this sordid affair without undue
                            difficulty.</p>
                        <p>Unless present favorable opportunity is seized now in endeavor once and
                            for all solve this problem I can only anticipate continuing difficulties
                            and serious obstacles our relations not only with Burma but I should
                            think in our endeavors give support Chinese Nationalist Government’s

                        <p>I therefore strongly recommend Embassy Taipei be urged make strong
                            approach to Chiang pointing out folly of present halfway measures.</p>

                        <p>On way to airport today I informed Vice President of Foreign Minister’s
                            conversation mentioned above. At airport Vice President invited Prime
                            Minister and Foreign Minister into plane for brief final discussion.
                            Vice President told them he understood their concern and skepticism re
                            further assistance which US Government can appropriately render in
                            finding solution <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> problem but that he
                            did not share their pessimism. He felt solution satisfactory to <gloss
                                target="#t_GUB1">GUB</gloss> is possible and that further measures
                            by US Government are feasible although of course unable say what
                            measures could or would be taken as this solely within province
                            President as advised by Secretary State. To this end Vice President
                            assured them he would at first opportunity sent telegram giving his
                            recommendations to Secretary State for discussion with the President in
                            consequence of which he hoped positive results would follow. Above all
                            else he hoped negotiations would not be discontinued and that cease-fire
                            could be extended for reasonable period. Neither Prime Minister nor
                            Foreign Minister gave any commitments but appeared gratified Vice
                            President’s assurance.</p>

                                refuge in Burma since 1949. In my opinion Chiang incapable of
                                accomplishing appreciably more than he is now doing to meet US

                                any particular quantity of arms, would “solve” problem. At best
                                situation can be measurably relieved and credit gained by US for

                            directed; it is always ready to take still stronger line including
                            issuance of threats of any kind desired. When latter point previously

                                Furthermore, they are convinced, quite irrationally, that the US, if
                                it so desires, can exert sufficient pressure on Chiang to force him

                                reported that on Nov. 27 a group of evacuees distributed to those

                                Burmese, entitled “circular letter to Burmese military officers and

                                declared that all the Chinese guerrilla troops had withdrawn to
                                Taiwan, and all the troops remaining were “international

                        <p>While no detailed information on subject available here it seems probable
                            that greater part of serviceable arms remaining in hands of foreign
                            forces in Burma are those received from outside source in 1951. Whether
                            they are identifiable as such, either from markings or from any
                            remaining packing, is not known to us. It has been suggested however
                            that jungle generals may be tactically justifying their withholding of
                            arms due some such considerations. Committee may have opinion on this
                            score.</p>

                            contrary to President’s instructions. As result latter on December 5
                            sent strongly worded telegram over his signature to General Liu
                                Yuen-ling<note n="2" xml:id="d132fn2">On Dec. 10, the Embassy in

                                the Chinese Foreign Office. It stated that Li Mi’s health and the
                                political situation made it impossible for him to return to Mong
                                Hsat, that it was imperative that all commanders should be urged to

                                that further struggle in the border regions would reduce them to an
                                untenable position, and that after thorough consideration, Chiang
                                felt there was no alternative to evacuation. It concluded by
                                appealing to all officers and men to come to Taiwan and stated that

                            additional men and has hopes of succeeding; (2) seek extension of
                            cease-fire for at least two weeks; (3) keep committee functioning; (4)
                            ask Burmese do their utmost to prevent incidents.</p>

                        <p>On December 8, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 717
                            (VIII), which noted that limited evacuation of foreign forces personnel
                            from Burma had begun, expressed concern that the foreign forces had
                            surrendered few arms, urged continuing efforts by all those concerned
                            for their evacuation or internment and the surrender of all their arms,
                            urged all states to refrain from providing assistance to the foreign
                            forces, and invited the Burmese Government to report on the situation as
                            appropriate. The resolution was adopted by 56 votes to none with 1
                            abstention (the Chinese Representative not participating). For the

                                344, Dec. 15, reported that Yeh told Jones that the generals in
                                Burma and the Defense Ministry were working on a plan to evacuate
                                150 men daily to a total of 2,000 a month but that the difficulties
                                involved might prevent the schedule from taking effect until
                                January. Jones cautioned against delay, stressing the importance of
                                prompt action to demonstrate Chinese good faith.
                                (690B.9321/12–1553)</note> Foreign Minister showed Jones this
                            morning copy of telegram received from General Liu Yuen-ling from
                            Monghsat dated December 13 requesting that jungle generals be given one

                            part of January. Program would be designed to remove 150 soldiers per
                            day as reported reference telegram. When two-thirds of evacuees
                            scheduled for first month had been processed committee would be informed
                            number ready for second month evacuation.</p>
                        <p>General Liu pointed out in telegram that it would take nearly two months
                            for troops to walk in from north and south locations which was reason

                        <p>In this connection General Pao requested that Burmese cease-fire be

                            travel of evacuees from all directions. He said if Burmese would refrain
                            from military action for three months he believed most of remaining

                            resulted from two developments (a) personal appeal by Generalissimo, (b)
                            generals in favor of evacuation now for first time have upper hand.</p>

                        <p>Jones repeated points made in reference telegram and stressed necessity
                            for more immediate evidence of good faith. He raised question as to
                            whether there were not still troops in vicinity of Monghsat who could be
                            evacuated this month. Foreign Minister and General Pao agreed that
                            effort in this direction could be made but emphasized necessity of
                            continuing basic headquarters organization as reception center for new
                            arrivals.</p>
                        <p>Two points remain to be settled before plans can be finalized. (1)
                            Assurance that funds will be made available to meet obligations incurred
                            by foreign forces in Burma as outlined reference telegram<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d135fn3">Reference is presumably to telegram 343 from
                                Taipei, Dec. 14, which reported Yeh’s request that the United States
                                consider providing a minimum of $200,000 to the Joint Military
                                Committee to assist in meeting the obligations of the evacuees. Yeh
                                considered this plan preferable to the small bonus payments
                                previously contemplated and thought it would greatly enhance the
                                evacuation, since the troops owed debts to the local tribesmen who
                                would be aroused if the men were to leave without paying them.
                                (690B.9321/12–1453)</note> and (2) question of arms. Each soldier
                            regards his rifle as his own personal property and wants assurance he
                            can bring it to Formosa with him, General Pao said. Jones pointed out
                            difficulties involved in this and said it was a matter to be determined
                            by the joint committee in Bangkok.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister was more optimistic than ever as to possibility for
                            obtaining genuine settlement problem foreign forces in Burma but
                            emphasized repeatedly importance of cooperation and patience on part of
                            Burmese Government. We have strong assurance that no delaying tactics
                            involved, that genuine cooperation appeared to be forthcoming from

                                received that day from the Chinese Foreign Office, which stated
                                that: (1) The Chinese Government had persuaded the leaders of the
                                guerrilla forces to evacuate more men from Burma, and it was
                                expected that the number would far exceed 2,000; (2) beginning in
                                mid-January, 150 men would be evacuated every other day, with the
                                number increasing to 150 per day, to a total of 2,000 for the first
                                month, and when two-thirds of that number had been evacuated, the
                                Joint Committee would be notified of the number expected in the
                                second month; (3) the guerrilla forces had requested $250,000 to
                                settle their debts and compensate individuals for their horses,
                                mules, and arms; (4) the guerrillas had offered to evacuate two of
                                their main bases before Dec. 29; (5) the guerrillas had requested
                                that they be permitted to bring their arms to Taiwan, and the
                                Chinese Government thought this would greatly help to induce the
                                evacuees to bring their arms out rather than to dispose of them to
                                the local population; (6) the guerrilla leaders wished to send a
                                representative to the Joint Military Committee to help work out an
                                evacuation plan, and the Chinese Government considered this highly
                                desirable; and (7) the Chinese Government hoped the Burmese
                                Government would extend the ceasefire to allow sufficient time for
                                the preparation and execution of the evacuation plan.

                            indicative its growing confidence handle own affairs. (Burmese, however,
                            desire employ foreign military “technicians” who would be under <gloss

                            British Embassy has informed us negotiations for arms procurement
                            agreement continue, but that abolition of <gloss target="#t_BSM1"
                                >BSM</gloss> makes it unlikely Burmese “would obtain same priority
                            as before.”</p>
                        <p>I have not changed views set forth my telegrams 658, October 22, 1952 and
                            287 September 28, ’53, and if anything believe more essential now that
                            Burmese armed forces be strengthened as matter priority and that
                            equipment for modest Burmese planned expansion of forces be furnished
                            either by <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> or US, or both. Failing
                            early action, we incur increasing risk that Burmese might turn toward
                            Communist bloc for supplies if sufficiently frustrated by procurement
                            problems. Also unfortunate would be possibility that Burmese <pb n="195"
                                xml:id="pg_195" facs="0215"/>might turn to Yugoslavia and establish
                            relationship which would tend strengthen Burma’s Marxist bias. Third
                            foreseeable result might be procurement of an arms assortment from
                            variety of sources, which, coupled with War Office’s intention obtain
                            technicians from sources of supply, could be expected result in cross
                            purposes among suppliers, and practically insurmountable linguistic,
                            technical and mechanical difficulties. On positive side, it also
                            follows, I believe, that Burmese forces with <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> or US equipment would necessarily in foreseeable future
                            be dependent upon free world for ammunition and parts, thus forestalling
                            their turning toward other sources of supply. Finally, by meeting
                            Burmese armament needs, as minimum on reimbursable basis, I believe
                            Burmese pro-western orientation would be encouraged and strengthened.
                            Conversely, deterioration of Burmese official friendliness toward US
                            consequent upon delays already encountered should make it self-evident
                            that something must be done if this trend is to be retarded or
                            reversed.</p>
                        <p>Problem of Indian adverse reaction toward contemplated US arms aid to
                            Pakistan would also appear relevant in connection with Burma’s needs. I
                            should think public knowledge that <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and
                            US are filling Burma’s arms requirements might well tend place
                            US–Pakistan agreement in its proper perspective, at least among Indian
                            leaders. It also appears not improbable that generous policy of arms
                            supply to Burma at this time could well result in driving wedge, however
                            slight, into neutral bloc presently under Nehru’s influence and apparent
                            leadership. We consider it probable that Burma, in its eagerness obtain
                            arms, would to some extent be willing run risk of compromising its
                            standing with neutral bloc members. (I do not mean suggest however that
                            Burma would in consequence arms procurement from <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> and US join western bloc or be willing stand up and be
                            counted. But such supply would act as spur in right direction. In fact,
                            this would appear to be proper moment for an assessment of our attitude
                            toward Asian neutrals. Upon expiry of British defense agreement, Burma
                            may offer opportunity of creating an example of willing and
                            straightforward cooperation between the United States as leading free
                            nation, and Burma, whose government gives unquestioned promise of
                            continuity and whose internal attitude toward communism is beyond

                            it appears inevitable that US must step into breach if Burmese leaders

                            if premise that Burma should be strong is accepted.</p>
                        <p>Above considerations would appear dictate desirability for immediately
                            renewed US sympathetic approach toward Burma in arms procurement
                            problem. As ultimate course of action, if it were feasible in light US
                            budgetary and existing world-wide commitments, would be special
                            legislation under which US could offer an outright gift of selected arms
                            and equipment (selected from lists attached Embassy despatch 66, August

                            amount $10 million without requiring any political commitments. (This
                            would be similar to precedent already established by gift ten Coast

                            be possible without new legislation, offer Burma selected items at
                            extremely liberal prices, perhaps on extended payment terms. Latter
                            course would preserve Burma’s amour propre and negate Communist charge
                            of direct interference in Burmese affairs, but would largely accomplish
                            desired objectives.</p>
                        <p>In summary, I strongly recommend and urge Department formulate policy

                        <p>While fully appreciating the thought and time which must have been spent
                            by the several Agencies of the United States Government in the
                            formulation of this rather formidable document, I feel that it might be
                            helpful to you to have my views on the Burma section. These views are
                                enclosed<note n="2" xml:id="d150fn2">Not printed.</note> in the form
                            of comments on each paragraph of the Burma section.</p>
                        <p>First of all, I would like to say that I have the impression that the
                            Burma section has largely resulted from an attempt to reconcile
                            conflicting premises. In consequence, portions of the policy appear to
                            me to be entirely unrealistic. Implementation of some of these sections
                            (specifically, paragraphs 40 and 41), could, I believe, result in
                            irreparable damage to the United States in this part of Asia.</p>
                        <p>I sense in the offending paragraphs a basic philosophy and belief that
                            only the minority ethnic groups in the Union of Burma are worthy of
                            United States trust and support. And, unless my reading of these
                            paragraphs is entirely wrong, I conclude that United States Government
                            policy envisages working through minority groups (Karens, Kachins, and
                            possibly Shans and others) with the objective of influencing the center.
                            Such a policy certainly puts the cart before the horse and its
                            implementation would not only be fruitless, but dangerous. In support of
                            my contention I will say, as I and my staff have said many times before,
                            that the Government of the Union of Burma (<gloss target="#t_GUB1"
                                >GUB</gloss>) is a going concern, is anti-communist, and above all
                            else has wide popular support. Our policy toward the <gloss
                                target="#t_GUB1">GUB</gloss>, therefore, should be one of
                            sympathetic understanding and designed to strengthen rather that weaken
                            the central government, and should have as its ultimate objective
                            swinging the <gloss target="#t_GUB1">GUB</gloss> around to aligning
                            itself with the West. Any action on our part which could result in
                            weakening this ultimate objective is not only self-defeating, <pb
                                n="205" xml:id="pg_205" facs="0225"/>but is shortsighted and, in my
                            opinion, not in the best interests of the United States and the Free
                            World.</p>
                        <p>The Burma policy having been approved by the President as part of the
                            entire document, it of course represents our present policy. I am also
                            aware of the practical difficulties of proposing changes at this time. I
                            do hope, however, that, as a minimum, consideration can be given in the
                            Department to a revised Burma policy for presentation to the <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> at an appropriate time. I think the
                            time has come when we should stop thinking in terms of what happened in
                            Burma in World War II and, whether we like them or not, squarely face
                            realities.</p>

                                            committing atrocities for past four years. Despite

                                            in that no arms were surrendered. When <gloss

                                            cease committing atrocities in areas affected. Yet

                                            people. Meanwhile public opinion in Burma has become

                            a résumé of the reaction in the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> to
                            the situation that has developed in connection with the Kuomintang
                            troops in Burma. On our part we would like to keep you informed of the
                            real situation in order that you will have a correct perspective.</p>
                        <p>It has distressed us to learn that one reaction in America in regard to
                            the offensive the Burmese Army has taken against these troops, is that
                            the Burmese position among the United Nations might be impaired. Such
                            talk began, as we expected, in Formosa and we do not pay much attention
                            to what emanates there. But when the Premier of a country adjacent to
                            Burma, and friendly to Formosa echoes these sentiments we begin to
                            wonder if it is the beginning <pb n="211" xml:id="pg_211" facs="0231"
                            />of a campaign of malice inspired by interested parties. In the <gloss
                                target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> such interested parties may have
                            resorted to tactics which would give the impression that Burmese
                            behaviour in regard to these troops has become unreasonable but we do
                            hope that the US Government does not share these views.</p>
                        <p>It will be realised that the Burmese have given ample time and
                            opportunity for these troops to evacuate. Negotiations have been
                            protracted and tedious. They have been living on the land and committing
                            atrocities for the past four years. Despite promise after promise of
                            evacuation they did nothing until the approach of the seventh Assembly
                            of the United Nations. And even that limited evacuation was farcical in
                            that no arms were surrendered. When the Burmese threatened military
                            action they were told to hold their hand not to disturb the flow of
                            evacuation and the chances of a peaceful settlement. Concession after
                            concession has been afforded to these people. They have been even
                            allowed to take away their arms, but on their part they have not kept to
                            their promises. With a show of evacuation they have consolidated their
                            position in Burma joining openly with subversive elements and taking
                            every possible step to make their stay permanent.</p>
                        <p>Even if they have thoughts of going they apparently desire to do so at
                            their convenience. In the meantime public opinion in Burma has become
                            more violent and an army that was poised for action had to be held back
                            for a long time. After all, the Chinese troops have been here for four
                            years and the Burmese could not but feel that they would have to
                            dislodge them by force of arms since a negotiated evacuation has proved
                            ineffective. And so after mature deliberation we acceded for the last
                            time for a cease fire to remain effective till March the 15th, 1954, in
                            respect of certain areas and March the 31st in respect of one area which
                            would be the gateway out of Burma, if these troops really mean to
                            go.</p>
                        <p>We are alive to the danger that this offensive might be taken as an
                            excuse by the authorities at Formosa to break off the evacuation
                            proceedings but in launching the offensive we had to risk such an
                            outcome. In any event we have been repeatedly told and we have no
                            illusions that some at least of the Generals and their followers would
                            not leave. This being the case, at some stage there would have to be a
                            resort to arms and this is being done while it is still possible before
                            the rains set in.</p>
                        <p>The action of the Burmese army, for the present is a limited one meant
                            solely to persuade these unwanted people into the safety zones where it
                            is hoped that they will see reason and leave this country. The offensive
                            has been instrumental in keeping up a steady flow of evacuation for the
                            past few days even if the ratio of arms taken out is so ridiculously
                            small. In leaving Burma and in <pb n="212" xml:id="pg_212" facs="0232"
                            />abandoning a senseless adventure they do so with bad grace and as a
                            final and unfriendly act they dispose of their arms to the Karen rebels,
                            and this is an added reason why the Burmese feel that their departure
                            must be hastened. I might add that even this phase of negotiated
                            evacuation is about to end solely for the reason that the number meant
                            to be evacuated has been reached, and there is no likelihood that those
                            still left would leave of their own accord, and hence our resort to
                            military action.</p>
                        <p>These remarks, I hope, will give you a clear picture of the position
                            prevailing. We find it difficult to understand how an action in defence
                            of our security and one meant to afford relief to our nationals can
                            justify an unfavorable reaction against us, unless of course it is
                            maliciously inspired and deliberately fostered. The whole world knows of
                            the patience and tolerance that the Burmese have displayed and we do
                            hope that at least the Government of the <gloss target="#t_USA1"
                                >USA</gloss> will understand our action, and that they will continue
                            to give us their sympathy and help.</p>
                        <p>We do not doubt for a moment that the Government of the <gloss
                                target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> desires to bring about a maximum
                            evacuation of these troops even if there are influential sections of the
                            American public who in their abhorrence of communism can forgive
                            anything that proclaims to be anti-communist. We can appreciate that
                            there would be many who would look upon the people of Formosa as a
                            likely spearhead for a return to the mainland of China, and if in that
                            belief, aid and succour is given to them, we have no right to protest.
                            But we deplore the fact that the authorities at Formosa are permitted to
                            commit aggression in this country under the guise, so blatantly false,
                            that they are crusaders against the menace of communism in the East.</p>
                        <p>Our request is that the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> would
                            continue to exert the utmost pressure on Formosa. It is lamentable that
                            even up to now no person in authority in Formosa has thought it fit to
                            recall them publicly and to make them understand that they are pursuing
                            a course which has brought not only discredit to Formosa but which has
                            also embarrassed her friends.</p>
                        <p>It will be ungrateful of the Burmese if they forget that the <gloss
                                target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> has rendered great help in the matter
                            and if further assurance of our gratitude is necessary I take the
                            opportunity of expressing it once again on behalf of the people of
                            Burma.</p>
                        <p>I remain,</p>

                            initial list submitted by the Burmese Government about ten months ago.
                            Copies of the memorandum and list have been given to the British Embassy
                            in Rangoon, and it is understood that they have already been forwarded

                        <p>It is impossible to predict the reaction of the Burmese Government to
                            this abbreviated list. It has become apparent to the Embassy, however,
                            that during the protracted waiting period while agreement was being
                            reached between the British and American Governments, the Burmese
                            practically abandoned hope of receiving substantial quantities of war
                            materials from the United States and lost interest in the matter. It is
                            especially unfortunate that the delay happened to coincide with efforts
                            to remove the Chinese irregular troops from this country, since these
                            troops are generally considered to be protegés of the United States, and
                            failure to supply arms promptly has probably been interpreted as being
                            prompted by a desire to avoid their use against these troops.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, even belated agreement to supply small quantities of
                            low-priority items can have a favorable psychological impact by
                            indicating that the American Government has sufficient confidence in the
                            orientation and stability of the Burmese Government to entrust it with
                            American arms.</p>
                        <p>The primary objective of the Burmese in seeking arms from the United
                            States, namely, to reduce their dependence upon the British, has not
                            been realized, and it has been made clear to them by this transaction
                            that the United States is prepared to be guided by British wishes.
                            Although the effect of this discovery upon the Burmese attitude toward
                            the United States may be expected to be unfavorable, the fact that the
                            negotiations have probably moved the British Government to liberalize
                            its own attitude toward the supplying of arms to Burma may to some
                            extent counteract this effect.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of our discussions with the Foreign Office, it would appear
                            that if the Burmese Government should decide to purchase any items from
                            the approved list the official diplomatic request will be made through
                            the Burmese Embassy in Washington to the <pb n="218" xml:id="pg_218"
                                facs="0238"/>Department, and that subsequent negotiations would be

                                received from the Burmese Foreign Office. The Attaché reported,
                                however, that about a month earlier, a Burmese Army officer actively
                                involved in the procurement negotiations told him that the high
                                prices quoted by the United States were evidently a backdoor means
                                of refusing to sell Burma arms and that the War Office recommended
                                against any purchase of arms from the United States. The report was

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Prime Minister</hi>: Thank you for your
                            letter of March fifteenth in which you set forth certain views regarding
                            the evacuation of foreign forces from Burma. I am keenly aware of your
                            concern in the matter, having myself followed the progress of the
                            operation, and I fully understand your position. I also believe that
                            this understanding is shared by informed American opinion.</p>
                        <p>At the time of the American Ambassador’s discussion with your Foreign
                                Minister,<note n="2" xml:id="d159fn2">See <ref target="#d151"
                                    >Document 151</ref>.</note> we were indeed concerned with the
                            effect which the reported initiation of Burmese military operations
                            might have on the efforts of the Joint Military Committee to complete
                            its mission. Happily the evacuation was completed as planned.</p>
                        <p>I am deeply gratified, as I am sure you are, to note that the evacuation
                            of almost 5,000 irregulars from the Shan State has been accomplished
                            through the international cooperation of Burma, Thailand, the Republic
                            of China, and the United States. We have consistently recognized that
                            there were limits to what could be achieved through international
                            action, but I sincerely hope that the results attained will have
                            contributed substantially to a final solution of the problem.</p>
                        <p>A share of credit is due the Chinese Government, without whose
                            cooperation no evacuation would have been possible. President <pb
                                n="219" xml:id="pg_219" facs="0239"/>Chiang Kai-shek took a direct
                            interest in the operation, and I understand that his personal appeal was
                            largely responsible for the fact that many more irregulars were
                            persuaded to leave than had been expected. Even though this appeal was
                            not made publicly, it was nonetheless effective. The Chinese Government
                            has, of course, stated publicly that those irregulars who refuse to
                            leave Burma can count on no support whatsoever.</p>
                        <p>In closing I assure you of my continued interest in the problem. In
                            particular, I hope that the further evacuation, now in prospect from the
                            Tenasserim Peninsula, may contribute toward solving Burma’s difficulties
                            with its own insurgents in that area.</p>

                                    future operations against the Communist rear. This plan, known
                                    as Operation <hi rend="italic">T’ien</hi> (‘heaven’) was later
                                    abandoned in favor of a complete withdrawal. However, certain
                                    facets of the operation were apparently set in motion during the
                                    First Phase of the evacuation which would explain the curious
                                    performance put on by an evacuee who masqueraded as Lieutenant
                                    General Lu Kuo-ch’uan, Commanding General of the 26th Army.</p>
                                <p>“It is possible that unexpected factors beyond the Chinese
                                    Government’s control made this operation impossible and brought
                                    about the abrupt decision to open negotiations for the
                                    withdrawal of several thousand additional troops immediately
                                    following the completion of the First Phase in December 1953. …
                                    Those Chinese officials responsible for forcing the decision to
                                    withdraw all of Li Mi’s troops evidently had to overcome
                                    powerful pro-Li Mi elements within the several branches of the
                                    Government.” (690B.9321/4–654)</p></note> After you have read
                            this despatch, I <pb n="221" xml:id="pg_221" facs="0241"/>am sure you
                            will agree with me that the story which it tells, a story which
                            obviously is far from complete, is fantastic.</p>
                        <p>I read the despatch, not with a feeling of “I told you so”, but rather
                            with a sense of depression brought on by the realization that the United
                            States Government could be so thoroughly hoodwinked by a friendly
                            government. In consequence, its officers were placed in the position of
                            assuring another friendly government in all good faith of Chinese <hi
                                rend="italic">bona fides</hi>, in the negotiations which took place
                            in Rangoon, Bangkok, and elsewhere over a period of so many months. I
                            note from the despatch under reference that the Chinese Foreign
                            Minister, among others, reportedly took part in a conference held on
                            June 9, 1953, at which certain basic Chinese policy regarding the
                            proposed evacuation was formulated. Thereafter, we in the field were
                            called upon again and again to nurse along, in strong language and with
                            soothing promises, the Burmese and others, and to explain away the
                            Chinese delays and frustrations which, as indicated in the despatch,
                            were agreed upon in advance and actually carried out according to
                            plan.</p>
                        <p>The reference despatch is also interesting in explaining the <hi
                                rend="italic">volte-face</hi> of the Chinese when the prospect of a
                            second evacuation was suddenly thrown into the mill for negotiation.
                            That we by that time did not voice our suspicions of Chinese wangling in
                            this affair, is something of a paradox to me, especially in the light of
                            my telegrams no. 396, October 27, 1953<note n="2" xml:id="d162fn2">In

                                in Burma would continue to present a problem after the completion of
                                the then planned evacuation, especially because of their reported
                                cooperation with the Karens in the Moulmein area.

                        <p>Fortunately for all parties concerned, the evacuation of a goodly portion
                            of the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss>’s from Burma appears to have
                            satisfied the Burmese Government and people that at least the United
                            States Government has done its utmost to bring about a successful
                            evacuation. This satisfaction will be increased, I believe, if the
                            Myawadi evacuation now planned is successfully carried out. I hope that
                            this will be so, and that when the Committee disbands, having completed
                            a “very successful operation”, we shall see the end of this problem.</p>

                        <p>I raise this matter at this time because of my concern over the
                            possibility that eventually complete information regarding Chinese
                            duplicity in the “first phase” evacuation might fall into the hands of
                            the Burmese Government. In the Orient, there are no secrets, and sooner
                            or later it appears almost inevitable that some dissident person,
                            Chinese or Karen, will inform Burmese Intelligence of what actually took
                            place. There is also the possibility that the Burmese Army may already
                            have captured sufficient documentary evidence from <gloss
                                target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> headquarters and elsewhere to piece
                            together a fairly accurate story regarding the first evacuation. I hope
                            that my fears are unfounded, but we may as well be realistic and be
                            prepared for the worst.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Bill</hi>: In the absence of Phil Bonsal, who
                            is still in Geneva, I opened your letter of April 29 concerning Taipei’s
                            despatch No. 573. I had not seen this despatch before receiving your
                            letter and am not certain that I would have seen it had you not written.
                            It paints a sorry picture. I am sure that you realize that anyone who
                            served in Rangoon from 1950 on is fully aware of how the <gloss
                                target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> troop business poisoned our relations
                            with Burma.</p>
                        <p>In the course of efforts to make an evacuation plan work this office and
                            the Office of Chinese Affairs found it necessary to send a stream of
                            instructions, some of which must have been extremely difficult to carry
                            out involving as they did approaches to the authorities on subjects
                            about which they were extremely sensitive.</p>
                        <pb n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0244"/>
                        <p>Without knowing precisely who was responsible or why it was so, we became
                            aware that all elements in Taipei were by no means cooperating, despite
                            Chiang Kai-shek’s commitment, and that there was a strong element among
                            influential political leaders which definitely opposed the plan at the
                            time. Phase I should have produced better results. So many instructions
                            were sent to Taipei that the traffic would hardly bear any more with any
                            chance of success. In sending instructions to you as well as to Bangkok
                            it was not intended that you should assume responsibility for the good
                            faith of the Chinese. The theory was that we were exercising good
                            offices for the mutual advantage of all concerned. We realized, however,
                            that the Burmese expected the Chinese to fulfill their share of the
                            bargain to the extent that we made representations on their behalf. In
                            asking the Burmese Government to cooperate in the scheme the Department
                            believed that despite obstacles and delays on the Chinese side positive
                            action by all three governments in addition to our own would have to be
                            secured.</p>
                        <p>There was one time when a current of opinion against Burma developed in
                            the Department and that was when Burma resorted to military action at a
                            time when it seemed here as if it would wreck the whole plan. Later the
                            general opinion turned in favor of Burma as the obstacles and delays on
                            the part of the Chinese became ever more apparent.</p>
                        <p>We now have the impression here that your efforts have done enormous good
                            in bringing our relations with Burma around to where they would be if
                            there had not been this <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> trouble. It
                            is certainly true that there is a danger that some of the information
                            reported in Taipei’s 573 will ultimately come to the knowledge of the

                                favored an early announcement by the Joint Committee that the

                            with Prime Minister U Nu yesterday, <pb n="225" xml:id="pg_225"

                            attitude which remains unchanged.</p>
                        <p>While statement by joint committee would be helpful, I consider Chinese

                            remaining behind as previously promised. I hope, however, that such
                            statement would be designed to clear atmosphere of suspicion, would not
                            be self-serving, and would tend improve understanding with <gloss

                        <p>Prior Chinese Government issuing statement, however, believe essential

                            fourth phase evacuation and reasons why committee considers further

                                told Rankin that the Chinese Government would continue to cooperate

                                but that it doubted any more guerrillas would choose to evacuate.

                            Government wants immediate formal termination of Joint Committee
                            operations. After discussions with Colonel I Fu-de and consideration by
                            Executive Yuan yesterday, conclusion reached that further attempts at
                            evacuation not only useless but also a mistake from both Chinese and
                            American standpoints as continuing efforts imply responsibility to
                            secure additional evacuation.</p>

                            Chinese Military Attaché in Bangkok will cooperate fully on informal
                            basis in arranging passage to Formosa. But Chinese Government is
                            convinced formal operations of Joint Committee should be declared
                            officially terminated soonest.</p>
                        <p>I requested Foreign Minister withhold any official Chinese announcement
                            this respect pending early advice from Washington or Bangkok. I also
                            repeated my earlier request that any statement issued by China avoid
                            recriminations. Minister gave assurance on this score.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador Sebald has reported on a two-hour luncheon conversation he had
                            alone on June 1 with Burmese Prime Minister U Nu<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d170fn1">Sebald reported the conversation in a memorandum of
                                conversation dated June 1, enclosed in despatch 500, June 4.
                                (790B.13/6–454)</note> during which the Prime Minister asserted that
                            he would like to speak out more boldly on the Communist Chinese danger
                            to Burma but is held back by the conviction that under present
                            circumstances such candor on his part would endanger Burmese democracy
                            by dividing his own Cabinet and aiding the Opposition. The Prime
                            Minister expressed his admiration for the boldness and forthrightness of
                            your own speeches.</p>
                        <pb n="230" xml:id="pg_230" facs="0250"/>
                        <p>He said that he and his Acting Foreign Minister, U Kyaw Nyein, have
                            agreed that neutrality is the best course for Burma to follow in view of
                            Burma’s internal difficulties and the need to get along with those of
                            their Cabinet colleagues whom the Prime Minister described as
                            unprincipled opportunists.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said he is exceedingly concerned over reports that the
                            Chinese Communists have been infiltrating into the northern border
                            areas. The Government, he said, already has some evidence that Chinese
                            Communist agents provocateurs have been sent in and that when more
                            evidence is at hand the Government plans to make a strong protest to
                            Peiping.</p>
                        <p>He was convinced that Nehru’s policies stem from a morbid fear of
                            Communist China. He said Nehru had dissuaded him last year from a plan
                            he was considering for a non-aggression pact with the Chinese
                            Communists; Nehru had argued that such a pact would only invite Chinese
                            Communist aggression somewhere else. Nehru seems convinced, the Prime
                            Minister thought, that the only way to keep Communist China from
                            aggression against India is to remove sources of friction. U Nu said he
                            does not share this view; that on the contrary he feels Southeast Asia
                            will be in imminent danger when the Communists consolidate their power
                            in China.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister was attracted by Ambassador Sebald’s explanation that
                            continuing U.S. support for the Government of the Republic of China
                            enables that Government to stand as a symbol and rallying point for
                            non-Communist overseas Chinese.</p>
                        <p>He expressed great admiration for the U.S., and the desire to visit here
                            when the time is right.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Sebald comments that his conversation has further reinforced
                            his conviction that the most responsible Burmese leaders are latently
                            pro-Western and definitely anti-Communist. Ambassador Sebald believes
                            Burma should not be pushed too rapidly or too far but that Burma’s
                            leaders should be kept frankly informed of developments in Southeast
                            Asia.</p>

                            not be welcome nor accepted under present conditions. They believe it
                            almost inevitable Burma will eventually become target for Chinese

                            believe can handle without too much difficulty. They convinced external

                            and, without desiring to supplant the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >U.K.</gloss>, to make clear that a British monopoly over Burmese
                            arms supply is not desirable (items 35 and 38a). Item 38b also
                            recommends urging the British to expand their military mission, but this
                            has been overtaken by events with the termination of that mission as of
                            January 4, 1954, by the Burmese.</p>

                            that in this role the U.S. should be less influenced by European allies
                            than in respect to Atlantic affairs (II, 18); also that a new U.S.
                            initiative should be undertaken to strengthen the uncommitted and
                            underdeveloped free world areas, particularly in Asia, by seeking their
                            cooperation on a basis of mutual self-respect and without attempting to
                            make allies of those not so inclined (IV, 22), Item 27 furthermore
                            recommends a review of aid policies to develop more flexible overall

                            supply is concerned have been unsatisfactory. The Burmese Government is
                            seeking a steady <pb n="236" xml:id="pg_236" facs="0256"/>source of
                            military equipment and training from free world sources, at a price it
                            can afford but under an arrangement which would in no way interfere with
                            Burmese control over military policy.</p>
                        <p>To this end Burma has despatched military missions to several free
                            nations, negotiated the Reimbursable Military Assistance agreement with
                            the United States, and discussed at length with Great Britain the
                            establishment of British supply and training on a new basis. These
                            efforts have been in the main unsuccessful to date because: (a) the free
                            nations other than the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss>
                            cannot provide the steadiness of supply, width of choice nor <hi
                                rend="italic">expertise</hi> which the Burmese desire; (b) U.S.
                            purchase prices are considered beyond the means of slender Burmese
                            dollar resources; the choice offered by the U.S. has moreover been
                            drastically limited by subjection to <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss>
                            screening; (c) the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> itself is
                            apparently not prepared to furnish military equipment and services
                            without exerting what the Burmese consider undue influence over their
                            military policies.</p>
                        <p>The Burmese, however, still hope for an arrangement whereby they can
                            purchase U.S. matériel on a more extensive basis than the very limited
                            “approved list,” and also “at a very reasonable price”. An approach on
                            these lines was made informally by the Acting Burmese Foreign Minister
                            in July, 1954; and the Foreign Minister has more recently indicated that
                            if this approach were encouraged Burma would formally request to send a
                            military purchasing mission to the U.S.</p>

                            failed not only because of the price factor but also because of the long

                            solely on the limited basis of the “approved list” finally concurred in
                            by the British and offered to Burma last March. A glance at this list,
                            summarized in Annex A, will show that its scope leaves much to be
                            desired.</p>
                        <p>The British assert they can adequately supply Burma’s military needs, but
                            the Burmese consistently maintain that the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >U.K.</gloss> is not doing so—a position concurred in by our
                            attachés at Rangoon. And although it appears not unlikely that the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> will be able to remain the
                            principal, if no longer the sole supplier of Burmese arms, the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> supply situation has been most
                            uncertain since the British Services Mission was terminated last
                            January. While the U.S. should undertake no more than a limited supply
                            role, any U.S. effort to be effective and worthwhile should be on a
                            basis of more latitude and flexibility than is afforded by the present
                            “approved list”. In line with current <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> directives, and especially <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> 5422/2 with respect to the degree of influence of
                            European allies, it is believed in the U.S. interest to extend the scope
                            of our supply to Burma beyond present limitations, on a relatively
                            modest but practicable and useable basis.</p>
                        <p>The Department of Defense has suggested as a possible course of action
                            that negotiations be reopened on the basis of supplying equipment for
                            complete military units rather than continue with the present piecemeal
                            offer. While such a course would have to be studied by Defense in the
                            light of availability and training considerations, as well as of Burmese
                            standards, capabilities and desires, some such practical approach should
                            be employed if a U.S. effort is to be effective.</p>
                        <p>When a U.S. decision has been reached to go ahead we should inform the
                            British of the proposed action to increase Burma’s potential for defense
                            against Communist subversion, expressing our hope that the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> will cooperate but making it clear that

                                    inquiries by Embassy Rangoon into the possibilities for sale of

                        <p>775. Eyes alone for Amb Cochran from Secy. I am concerned at the serious
                            results which wld flow from any further hardening of the Indonesian
                            attitude toward the New Guinea question. You will recall they asked us
                            to use our influence with the Dutch to keep the negots at The Hague
                            going on this subj<note n="1" xml:id="d181fn1">Discussions took place at
                                The Hague from Jan. 15 to Mar. 1, 1952 between representatives of
                                Indonesia and the Netherlands on the questions of revision of the
                                Netherlands-Indonesian Union and the future status of Netherlands
                                New Guinea (West Irian). No final agreements were reached during
                                these discussions which were terminated by the departure of the
                                Indonesian Delegation subsequent to the fall of the Indonesian

                            shipments on the way from Holland to New Guinea. As it happens, the
                            Dutch had already decided to go ahead with The Hague talks and to try to
                            work out something about the seizure of arms shipments separately
                            through dipl channels. I think it is important that Indonesians fully
                            understand that Dutch arrived at this decision without any pressure from
                                us.<note n="2" xml:id="d181fn2">The Netherlands Government made the

                        <p>I think it is perhaps more important that Indonesians fully understand
                            our position in this whole matter. You will remember that position of
                            Dutch and Indonesians tended to harden on New Guinea issue as long ago
                            as Spring of 1950. Since that time, this govt has given no support to
                            specific proposals of either party for settlement. We have until now
                            taken the stand that the future status of western New Guinea shld be
                            determined through direct negots between Dutch and Indonesians. That is
                            why we were willing to ask Dutch to continue current talks at The Hague.
                            It shld not be gathered from this, however, that our asking Dutch to
                            continue those talks means that we were supporting Indonesians. On the
                            contrary, I do not see how it will be possible for us now or in the
                            future to support the present position of either side on this issue.</p>
                        <p>There is no prospect whatever that present Dutch Govt can or wld agree to
                            a transfer of sovereignty over Western New Guinea to Indonesia. There
                            are many internal reasons for this with which you are familiar and, as
                            you know, they feel they can rely heavily on Austral support. Gen
                            elections in Holland will occur at the end <pb n="250" xml:id="pg_250"
                                facs="0270"/>of June. It may be that the new Govt can arrive at some
                            satisfactory solution with Indonesians. But I have doubts whether they
                            can do this alone. For they are not alone. The Australians are very much
                            present. If matters are allowed to drift too long, we see the seeds of
                            an impasse of the Iranian and Egyptian order forming. We are at work and
                            shall urgently continue to work on formulating possible compromises
                            based upon such safeguarding as is possible of the basic interests of
                            Indonesia, the Netherlands, and Australia. It is not a simple task.</p>
                        <p>But at present, for reasons mentioned above, no solution seems possible.
                            Therefore, the fundamental U.S. interest is to keep the disagreement
                            from becoming blown up, to prevent a breach, to help reach such
                            agreements on the union as can be reached, leaving the door open for
                            future talks.</p>
                        <p>For this purpose our present line of saying merely that the Dutch and
                            Indonesians shld work out a solution is not adequate. They cannot do it
                                <hi rend="italic">now</hi>. Talks on this subj between them can last
                            only so long at one time. Panmunjom is no model for this situation.</p>
                        <p>So we must try our best to give Indonesians wise guidance as we try to
                            give it to Dutch. In this case, it means trying to get them to consider
                            not only their domestic polit problems but the facts of life. Surely
                            they have to pursue actively their objective, the <gloss

                            and shld not, pull the house down around their ears like Salaheddin<note

                            their purpose. It will assure its defeat, with tragic consequences.
                            Dutch cannot agree now to a solution. Australians will react strongly to
                            anything like the pattern followed in Palestine, Iran and Egypt.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, persistence and moderation on the part of Indonesians
                            will, I think, bring relieved cooperation from Dutch and Australians in
                            the measurable future.</p>
                        <p>This is the direction along which our deepest interest urge that we shld
                            guide them. It is no objection that to do so may put some strain upon
                            their regard for us. We prize and must retain that regard. But its
                            possession entails the responsibility to use it for our true and deepest
                            mutual interests.</p>
                        <p>What I am asking you to do is a job which will be at least as hard to get
                            done as the job you did for us on the Japanese Treaty. I am confident
                            that you can handle this one just as well. As you have so often observed
                            they are a new nation and in need of sound advice. I believe they will
                            accept your good guidance on this issue, <pb n="251" xml:id="pg_251"

                            them. It is vital to us that this issue does not explode.</p>
                        <p>We want any views you have on a substantive solution which would
                            recognize Dutch, Indonesian and Australian interests and give hope of
                            gaining acceptance of the three. In the meanwhile, of course, you shld
                            say nothing about the possibility of any U.S.-suggested solution.</p>

                        <p>1095. Eyes alone for Secretary from Ambassador. Called on Foreign
                            Minister Subardjo 29th. He raised question Netherlands relations. He
                            expressed concern lest Netherlands delegate give such definite rebuff to
                            Indonesian delegation Hague on <gloss target="#t_NNG1">NNG</gloss> issue
                            Indonesian Govt would decide recall Indonesian delegation and Parliament
                            then proceed with unilateral abrogation Union Statute. In answer my
                            question Subardjo said he thought majority Cabinet would favor
                            unilateral action in such circumstances. Subardjo said he had always
                            opposed unilateral action and had taken course he thought most likely
                            avoid it namely entering conversations with Netherlands Govt at Hague.
                            He still thinks right in making this attempt. If this attempt fails,
                            however, he fears his people might “run amuck”. He said his govt could
                            look to no one but US for assistance.</p>
                        <p>I said my govt did not favor unilateral abrogation of international
                            engagements. I warned against examples of Iran and Egypt. I suggested
                            possibility strong reprisals from Netherlands. I said costly confusion
                            could result.</p>
                        <p>Again Subardjo said his government had never wanted unilateral action but
                            pressure had now become so strong government would not be able resist it

                                >NNG</gloss> issue. When I reminded him breaking union would not
                            solve <gloss target="#t_NNG1">NNG</gloss> question, he admitted this but
                            said already active movement in favor setting up “government in exile”

                        <p>I told Foreign Minister my government always hoped amicable solution
                                <gloss target="#t_NNG1">NNG</gloss> could be achieved through direct
                            conversations and favored such discussions. My government had recently
                            transmitted to Netherlands Government message which Indonesian
                            Government had given me when it appeared conversations might not be
                            started at Hague because of Netherlands insistence on intermixing
                            question arms seizures. US had shown complete willingness use its good
                            offices this manner, but Netherlands Cabinet had taken decision to be
                            [continue?] conversations on Indonesian terms before US intervention
                            took place. I said Indonesians should know by this time there is no
                            prospect of Netherlands Government agreeing prior June elections to
                            transfer sovereignty over <gloss target="#t_NNG1">NNG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Subardjo hoped it might still be possible for Netherlands delegate come
                            forward with some proposal which would leave Indonesian delegation in
                            position to report outlook for hopeful results in a later conference. I
                            said I had not yet seen any evidence on side either Indonesia or
                            Netherlands to be willing compromise on <gloss target="#t_NNG1"
                                >NNG</gloss> issue. I told Subardjo if he had any ideas whatever on
                            this subject I would be glad discuss them with him and see if I could
                            make anything out of them. When I mentioned trusteeship of some sort he
                            said his country would not accept.</p>
                        <p>While we are seeking some way out, I feel it essential Department bring
                            home to Netherlands and Australian Governments seriousness of
                            consequences Subardjo and I think might result from complete breakdown
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Both sides firmly entrenched. Both sides virtually requesting US open
                            support.</p>
                        <p>While Netherlands may be reconciled to dissolution Union, it should be
                            earnestly concerned lest this be accomplished in circumstances that
                            would endanger continuing economic interests.</p>
                        <p>Indonesian Government on its side concerned lest unilateral action would
                            bring international criticism of new states so deeply indebted to <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> for its sovereignty and so anxious to
                            reach position importance in world affairs. At same time Indonesians
                            would oppose any compromise which smacked of yielding to colonial
                            authority and of perpetuating western influence on their new state. They
                            can become quite fanatic on this subject.</p>
                        <p>US not likely be able influence Indonesia against unilateral abrogation
                            unless US in position promise Indonesia hopeful outcome <gloss

                            leaders as they now stand rule out such possibility foreseeable
                            future.</p>
                        <p>Parties obviously cannot settle their difficulties by direct bilateral
                            negotiations. They might both be relieved to have outside force take
                            over some responsibility.</p>
                        <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0273"/>
                        <p>What would Dept think of encouraging Netherlands Government now come out
                            with offer abide by decision any international body parties might decide
                            upon to adjudicate <gloss target="#t_NNG1">NNG</gloss> once Union
                            question settled by direct negotiations?</p>
                        <p>Had just completed foregoing paragraphs when called to Foreign Office
                            this noon by Subardjo. Am not changing above since it provides
                            background for following:</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister said Supomo had reported no progress on <gloss
                                target="#t_NNG1">NNG</gloss>, outlook hopeful on Union negotiations,
                            and some possibility Netherlands might be willing delay action on
                            constitutional amendment on Irian until after Netherlands elections.
                            Subardjo anxious avoid deadlock and asked if I could submit any
                            “formula” to prevent it.</p>
                        <p>I asked Foreign Minister how he would look upon arrangement whereunder:
                            (1) Irian question would remain on Hague agenda; (2) Netherlands would
                            agree suspend Parliament action on amending constitution on Irian
                            pending elections; (3) delegations would proceed with revision Union;
                            and (4) two parties would agree that if they could not by direct
                            bilateral negotiations reach agreement within fixed period time, say one
                            or two months, after concluding revision Union, they would submit Irian
                            question to international body to be selected jointly by two parties,
                            and they would pledge themselves to abide by decision of that body with
                            respect Irian.</p>
                        <p>Subardjo and his general adviser, Hanifah, who was present, indicated
                            interest. Foreign Minister said he would sound out Cabinet colleagues
                            and let me hear. I asked whether it would be easier for <gloss
                                target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>s present above proposal or for it to
                            come from Netherlands delegate if my government might see fit pass
                            suggestions to Netherlands Government and latter accepted it. Subardjo
                            said he would also get Cabinet’s opinion on this point.</p>
                        <p>I made clear that my “formula” was purely personal and unofficial and
                            advanced upon request.</p>
                        <p>Will report promptly any developments. This message should not, of
                            course, be repeated Hague or elsewhere.</p>

                        <p>On January 29 Ambassador Cochran advanced a personal formula to the
                            Indonesian Foreign Minister whereunder (1) the New Guinea question would
                            remain on The Hague agenda; (2) the Netherlands would agree to suspend
                            Parliamentary action on amending the Netherlands Constitution on New
                            Guinea pending elections; (3) the two Delegations now meeting at The
                            Hague would proceed with negotiating the revision of the
                            Netherlands-Indonesian Union; and (4) the two parties would agree that
                            if they could not by bilateral negotiations reach agreement on New
                            Guinea within a fixed period of time after concluding the revision of
                            the Union, they would submit the New Guinea question to an international
                            body to be selected jointly by the two parties and would pledge
                            themselves to abide by the decision of that body regarding New
                            Guinea.</p>
                        <p>Judging from The Hague’s telegram 791 of February 1,<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d183fn3">Not printed.</note> it looks as if the Dutch may
                            already have gone a long way toward meeting three of Ambassador
                            Cochran’s four-point formula without any prodding from us. The Embassy
                            has been informed that at a special session of the Netherlands Cabinet
                            on January 31 it was decided that if the Indonesian Delegation wished to
                            continue talks regarding New Guinea, the Indonesian Government, on its
                            own initiative, may refer the specific issue of sovereignty over New
                            Guinea to an international law body. Meanwhile, during the time the
                            dispute over sovereignty of New Guinea is being handled by a court, the
                            Dutch would be agreeable to continue talks on other political problems
                            relating to New Guinea.</p>
                        <p>The Netherlands Foreign Office has pointed out that the Cabinet’s
                            proposal avoided mentioning either the Union Court of Arbitration or the
                            International Court of Justice because, if arbitration is agreeable to
                            the Indonesians, the specific body can be worked out between the two
                            Governments. Parenthetically, I may say it seems to us the Foreign
                            Office view may be somewhat on the optimistic <pb n="255"
                                xml:id="pg_255" facs="0275"/>side regarding the ease with which
                            agreement could be worked out between the two Governments regarding a
                            specific body.</p>
                        <p>The above Dutch proposals do not meet Ambassador Cochran’s second point
                            regarding suspension of Parliamentary action to amend the Netherlands
                            Constitution on the New Guinea question pending elections this Spring.
                            It is clear, however, that Netherlands Parliamentary action to amend the
                            Netherlands Constitution on this matter in no way will affect the
                            ultimate disposition of sovereignty over New Guinea and the Netherlands
                            willingness to submit the question of sovereignty to an international
                            law body should be sufficient evidence of this for the Indonesians.</p>
                        <p>At this juncture it is important to emphasize that the Dutch have
                            indicated their willingness to submit the question of sovereignty over
                            New Guinea to international adjudication or arbitration without any
                            urging from us. It is in our interest, I believe, that we continue as
                            long as may be possible to avoid utilizing our influence with the Dutch

                                <p>On the same day, Lacy commented on this memorandum in the
                                    following memorandum to Allison:</p>
                                <p>“Mr. Coerr and I have changed our minds about the desirability of
                                    recommending a positive course of action to the Secretary now in
                                    the matter of New Guinea. We believe it best to do nothing at
                                    this moment; this position we adopt because of (a) Cochran’s No.
                                    1107, February 2 [not printed] from which it seems clear to us
                                    that any further efforts on Cochran’s part to persuade the
                                    Indonesians to accept what is now a Dutch proposal will be
                                    unproductive, or worse, and (b) the considerations which Jo
                                    Scott has embodied in the memorandum which he has prepared for
                                    Mr. Bonbright to send to Mr. Matthews (copy attached). We hope
                                    you agree.” (656.56D/2–452)</p>

                                    question. This info was passed on by me to Cols Beach and

                            not have text thereof. He explained that text of assurances he had given

                            if he had talked recently with any <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>
                            Govt official in regard necessity <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>

                        <p>Hayes said Marmora (from North Amer Desk in FonOff) had come to his

                            of act, and wanted Hayes explain certain provisions from his own copy.
                            Hayes said he did go over certain provisions of act, with copy before
                            them, and explained <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi> how econ aid cld
                            be given if only 511 (b) assurances provided.</p>

                        <p>I reminded Hayes I had been most unhappy on Jan 29 to learn from him that

                            strict moratorium on publicity while I had several negots under way. I
                            reminded him further that on Feb 5 he had expressed to me his concern
                            lest assurances I had obtained might embarrass govt. I said I recalled
                            he had argued then, as he had many times previously with me, in favor of
                            our asking <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> only for 511 (b)
                            assurances.</p>
                        <p>I had beseeched Hayes leave matter of negotiation to my judgment. I had
                            said any initiative for weaker assurances wld have to come from <gloss
                                target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>s. I had reminded Hayes that if we had
                            only 511 (b) assurances it wld be necessary <gloss target="#t_Indo1"

                            granted mobile constabulary. I told him top secretly our Mil Attachés
                            had been approached frequently and feverishly past few weeks by officers
                            of <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> Armed Services almost begging
                            for some arrangement that wld provide them with much needed ammunition
                            and arms in their difficult campaign against insurrectionists Central
                            Java and renegades and religious fanatics West Java. I had told him I
                            thought we were right in these circumstances in doing best to get
                            agreement accepted by <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> Govt which
                            wld not oblige raising of question re original police equip agreement,
                            and wld permit any type of mil aid being given in future emergency. I
                            was aware 511 (a) assurances not requisite to reimbursable aid. At same
                            time, I knew certain undertakings wld be required for reimbursable aid
                            which <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> Govts in past have been
                            reluctant to give.</p>
                        <p>Above all, I reminded Hayes I had told him, when I was so struck with his
                            insistence on 511 (b), that if I heard of anyone on US Govt payroll in

                            any way contributing to thinking of <gloss target="#t_Indo1"
                                >Indo</gloss> Govt toward seeking release from assurances which I
                            had obtained, I wld ask that person’s immediate withdrawal from <gloss
                                target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>. I told him his statement to Marmora
                            had now come back to me in manner which indicated his expression on this
                            contentious issue had contributed to strengthening of opposition to govt
                            and consequently might be contributing also to fall of Sukiman govt.
                            Hayes ridiculed idea this cld be true. He admitted Marmora had visited

                        <p>Recd 10 a.m. by Pres Sukarno, his request. He said Sukiman govt in
                            trouble. Said this came in part from technical error of Subardjo in not
                            consulting other members Cabinet particularly Defense <gloss

                                <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>I reviewed negots with Subardjo up to and incl delivery of ltr explaining
                            visit of my mil officers to Ministry Def. Sukarno said Subardjo had
                            shown him this yesterday eve. I told Pres I had taken up matter <gloss
                                target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> assurances early in Dec and had only
                            obtained action thereon shortly before deadline. I said my dealings had
                            been directly with <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>. I was
                            aware he had consulted <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> but did
                            not know to what extent other Cabinet Ministers had been informed. I
                            thought most unfortunate Subardjo shld now become victim internal polit
                            attack. I said I had indicated willingness my govt make sufficient
                            concessions in exchange of notes to meet reasonably <gloss
                                target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> special position.</p>
                        <p>Pres then said great suspicion in <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>
                            of Amer policy toward <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>. I said I
                            was deeply conscious sentiment in <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>
                            and had been unable thru my own efforts rectify it. I said I had
                            frequently thought of various measures to suggest to my govt or to take
                            on my own initiative. Among latter were speeches that might be made by
                                <pb n="263" xml:id="pg_263" facs="0283"/>myself or members my
                            organization. Appreciating <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>’s
                            tendency to doubt anything, however, that might smack of propaganda, I
                            had refrained from public addresses. I thought Amer foreign policies
                            made amply clear to world thru statements Pres, Secy State, <gloss
                                target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> bulletins, etc.</p>
                        <p>Sukarno insisted something shld be done to improve relations. I reminded
                            Pres this was birthday great Amer for whom he professed admiration. I
                            thought on this anniversary of Lincoln we shld be very honest with each
                            other. I said that since my return to <gloss target="#t_Indo1"
                                >Indo</gloss> as first Amer Amb I had never heard one friendly
                            reference in statement by any official of <gloss target="#t_Indo1"
                                >Indo</gloss> Govt towards <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>,
                            which had been so importantly responsible for <gloss target="#t_Indo1"
                                >Indo</gloss> achieving sovereignty and which had been one nation
                            take leadership in aiding young sovereign state. I said I thought
                            relations cld be much improved if one such statement cld now be
                            made.</p>
                        <p>Pres said he cld name “weapon” which cld be used effectively against all
                            misunderstanding. I said I assumed he meant public statement by US Govt
                            favoring <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> position on Irian. He
                            said that was it exactly. I said he shld know by reports from his dipl
                            officers abroad and from his own <gloss target="#t_FonMin1"
                                >FonMin</gloss> that I have been criticized by more than one govt
                            close to that of US for allegedly assuming unneutral attitude on Irian
                            question and for inciting <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> to press
                            claim therefor. I said this cld easily become matter of concern to my
                            govt. I said I cld not go beyond certain line without violating
                            responsibility imposed on me and without destroying trust in my judgment
                            on part superior officers in Washington. Pres said he and <gloss
                                target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> Govt entirely cognizant and most
                            appreciative of friendship and support I have extended <gloss
                                target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> from my first arrival. He said fault
                            was, however, lack of clear official Amer policy toward <gloss
                                target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>I said I hoped I cld clarify this a little by a few frank statements. I
                            said we were appreciative of <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>
                            desire to follow independent policy and we try in every way respect
                                <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> position. I recalled, however,
                            that my country had also become independent long before <gloss
                                target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>. In my independent country Congress
                            had right to determine how our tax payers’ money shld be spent and what
                            conditions shld be prescribed therefor. I said we did not oblige or
                            insist that anyone accept our aid. I said there were many demands
                            thereon by our Allies in addition to keeping our own heavy program of
                            production and defensive effort going. I said it wld be most unclear to
                            my govt if in turn for support we have consistently given new Repub we
                            shld be suspected of endeavoring undermine <gloss target="#t_Indo1"
                                >Indo</gloss>’s independence. I said I had never once approached
                                <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> Govt on question bases or
                            Mutual Security Pact. I said my govt understood any initiation on Mutual

                            alone.</p>

                            knowledge I had worked with Subardjo toward getting assurances which wld
                            permit any kind of aid. I thought it wld be ridiculous if <gloss

                            if my govt shld withdraw me. I said I did not know that this issue wld

                            be thru frank exchange of views such as we had just had, with each

                            agreements negotiated with India, Burma and Pak. He found, as I had

                            along line 511 (b) than (a). Subardjo promptly said conditions those

                            had practically nothing. He also assumed that such countries cld have

                        <p>Subardjo insisted he and I had been working in best interests <gloss

                            civil police if provision Amer equip were cut off. Subardjo thought it
                            wld be policy of weakness for any <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>
                            govt withdraw from assurances now given and seek watered-down 511 (b)
                            arrangement whereunder small amount econ aid wld be recd. He deprecated
                            need for financial aid in view <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>s
                            large dollar balances. He expresses strong fear of US official and

                            needing mil equip wld seek escape from prescribed assurances and still

                            from <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> and one from reliable
                            Cabinet friend of longstanding. I give more credence to second version
                            of what took place but submit for Dept’s info account of both.</p>

                            <item><p><gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> Sukiman called me to
                                    his home 6 p.m. 21st. Told me Cabinet had disapproved Subardjo’s
                                    granting <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> assurances and
                                    accepted resignation as consequence. He asked if <gloss

                                    511 (b) assurances. I told him I had no auth approve withdrawal
                                    from commitment already made by <gloss target="#t_FonMin1"
                                        >FonMin</gloss> with knowledge <gloss target="#t_PriMin1"
                                        >PriMin</gloss> but wld report facts to my govt.</p>
                                <p>In answer my question <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>
                                    said Subardjo’s undertaking binding far as Cabinet concerned but
                                    he thought parliament wld insist on necessity ratification act
                                    and wld disapprove. He feared <gloss target="#t_Indo1"
                                        >Indo</gloss>-US relations wld be damaged by Parliament
                                    debate and resulting rejection.</p>
                                <p>I reminded <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> neither
                                    Natsir’s nor his own govt had seen fit submit for ratification
                                    basis <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> bilateral agreement
                                    negotiated Oct 1950. I said that when Parliament Comite recently
                                    insisted upon internatl agreements being submitted to
                                    Parliament, FonOff had provided list those negotiated but not
                                    ratified. This list did not include <gloss target="#t_ECA1"
                                        >ECA</gloss> bilateral. He confirmed it required
                                    ratification.</p>
                                <p>In answer my question whether his govt wld now resign, <gloss
                                        target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> said decision wld be
                                    taken at next mtg provisionally scheduled 5 p.m. 22nd. I asked
                                    if decision wld depend upon US attitude toward replacing 511 (a)
                                    assurances with (b). He replied affirmatively.</p>
                                <p>I told <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> I hoped his
                                    Cabinet had not been influenced by polit and press campaign of
                                    other countries. I insisted Pakistan, Burma and India had
                                    actually signed <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> agreements.
                                    I told him I was not at all convinced his govt, after failure
                                    submit <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> bilateral for

                            <item>Visited Cabinet friend 7:30 p.m. Gave him account my talk with
                                    <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>. He expressed
                                disagreement Sukiman version and surprise at his approach to me. He
                                said Cabinet session had not progressed beyond voting disapproval of
                                Subardjo’s procedure in consummating agreement. Said substance
                                agreement not discussed. Said question consulting me with respect
                                substitution (b) for (a) assurances not mentioned in mtg. He
                                interpreted Sukiman tactic as unfair endeavor place responsibility
                                for life Cabinet on US Govt.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>My friend said he had opposed Subardjo being required seek any
                            clarification or interpretation. He said Sukiman, Wibisono,<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d192fn1">Jusuf Wibisono, Minister of Finance.</note>

                                Health.</note> and he had been constantly in favor 511 (a)
                            assurances, they all realizing <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>
                            need for mil equipment now and perhaps increased aid in future.</p>
                        <p>My friend confirmed he had given story to press to effect Subardjo’s
                            negots should be considered binding. If govt not willing approve shld
                            resign <hi rend="italic">in toto</hi>. To me, he was critical Sukiman’s
                            idea throwing out Subardjo and still trying carry on with same Cabinet.
                            He thought Sukiman only confusing situation further by this last
                            maneuver of appealing to US. He said both <gloss target="#t_Indo1"
                                >Indo</gloss> and US Govts wld lose prestige through any weakened
                            arrangement. Cabinet had not been canvassed to see whether it wld
                            approve 511 (b) assurances. He was not at all sure Sukiman govt wld
                            present any mutual security arrangement to Parliament and obtain
                            approval thereof.</p>
                        <p>I was unfavorably impressed by Sukiman’s fumbling and faltering
                            explanations and arguments when we discussed questions. In view my
                            friend’s forthright version am most reluctant place any faith in Sukiman
                            being able see present issue through satisfactorily. I am basically and
                            strongly against US retracting from agreement honorably entered.
                            Moreover, I feel we shld be taking tremendous risk of losing prestige
                            and incurring further misunderstandings if we count on Sukiman getting
                            511 (b) assurances through Parliament. Fol violent public campaign
                            against <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss>, any thing smacking of
                            mutual security undertaking likely be strongly opposed. In addition,
                            there are phrases in 511 (b) such as “to take such action as may be
                            mutually agreed upon to eliminate causes of internatl tension” that wld
                            cause much real or simulated concern and involve us in further
                            clarifications, interpretations, etc. To present, I have refrained from
                            any public statement, leaving opportunity to <gloss target="#t_Indo1"
                                >Indo</gloss> Govt defend its action and obtain our help. Believe we

                            Vilification US in local press widespread. Neither any important leader
                            any polit faction nor Pres or Vice Pres has publicly given US benefit of

                        <p>Suggest in future dealings with <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>s we

                            and I had favored 511 (a) agreement: Police equip still arriving and

                                the Foreign Minister had informally told him that the Indonesian
                                Government could not accept the 511 (a) Agreement and would instruct
                                Ambassador Ali in Washington to request substitution of a 511 (b)
                                Agreement instead. He went on to say that he expected the Department

                            he had given me informally on night 6th decision of Cabinet reached
                            preceding evening. He now desired I be formally advised thereof. He
                            asked Darma explain this. Darma said Cabinet had decided 511 (a)
                            agreement entered into by Subardjo and Cochran was binding but that
                            Wilopo Govt not willing support it. I asked if this was formal approach
                            to me for amendment 511 (a) agreement. Answer was negative.</p>
                        <p>Minister said he and Darma desired discuss situation frankly with me.
                            Minister said some members Cabinet hoped amendment cld be obtained for
                            511 (b) assistance in terms similar Burma agreement. He said Ali had
                            been informed of Cabinet decision and instructed seek sentiment of State
                            Department on possible amendment. I recalled <gloss target="#t_FonMin1"
                                >FonMin</gloss> had told me this on previous occasion and I had been
                            surprised <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> Govt appeared desire
                            transfer <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> discussions to Wash. I said
                                <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>s of course at liberty approach
                            my govt on any subj they wished through their own Amb. I made point,
                            however, that Dept had seen fit entrust to chiefs of missions abroad
                            negots of all agreements under <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> so
                            far as I aware. <pb n="285" xml:id="pg_285" facs="0305"/>Darma said he
                            shld tell me frankly decision resulted in part from story reaching
                            Cabinet that I opposed change from 511 (a).</p>
                        <p>I reminded Darma I had given <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> Govt
                            through Subardjo choice of 511 (a) or (b) when negots started. Subardjo
                            had chosen 511 (a) and my govt agreed this was type of agreement most
                            suitable. I had of course regretted difficulties resulting from this
                            choice but I still thought it was most advantageous arrangement
                            conceivable. I insisted I always reported and wld continue to submit
                            accurately any request that might be made to or through me by <gloss
                                target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> Govt. I recalled that on reaching 511
                            (a) agreement my govt had made every amendment or accepted every
                            interpretation <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> Govt sought. I said
                            it was for <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> Govt decide whether it
                            desired endeavor maintain 511 (a) agreement. Mukarto said report was
                            being awaited from Ali as to results his talks with State Dept before
                            determining wording with respect to <gloss target="#t_Indo1"
                                >Indo</gloss> Govt’s attitude on <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss>
                            to be included in statement to Parl.</p>
                        <p>Mukarto said that with elections coming on his govt wld find itself
                            embarrassed to meet such opposition as was likely to be encountered in
                            Parl if it submitted 511 (a) for ratification. I deplored criticism that
                            had been made of this agreement both in govt circles and in press. I
                            thought this resulted largely from lack of info in regard to
                            arrangement. I pointed out no good account thereof had been made to
                                <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> public until Wibisono’s<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d201fn2">Jusuf Wibisono, former Minister of

                                target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>s wld weigh seriously advantages
                            accruing to them through 511 (a) and disadvantages and losses that wld
                            result from giving up or amending this in favor any other possible
                            arrangement.</p>
                        <p>I asked if idea had occurred to <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>s of
                            simply stating to Parl that new govt is reviewing entire field of
                            internatl relations including such problems as those of Jap Treaty,
                            union statute and <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> with purpose
                            obtaining exact facts and eliminating any misconceptions. I thought such
                            statement might appropriately be made and carry assurance that new govt
                            cld be counted upon in implementation of existing undertakings not to
                            infringe sovereignty or detract from independent policy of <gloss
                                target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>. Mukarto said there was no intention
                            to tell Parl 511 (a) must be eliminated. He repeated that statement wld
                            likely be eliminated [<hi rend="italic">limited</hi>?] to explanation
                            that question of <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> was being studied.
                            Any addition to this statement wld depend upon report from Ali.</p>
                        <p>I told Mukarto I was glad he had opportunity meet Secretary Acheson well
                            as Lacy and Coerr who worked directly on <gloss target="#t_Indo1"
                                >Indo</gloss> matters. I said these three well as Asst Secy Allison
                            on whom Ali had called to give Cabinet decision, were entirely familiar
                            with all my <pb n="286" xml:id="pg_286" facs="0306"/>negots and they in
                            turn kept me fully informed as to official conversations carried on in
                            Wash with <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> auths there. I said this
                            was to everyone’s advantage. I told Mukarto I was glad he had lived in
                            my country and had learned our habits and that Darma also knew us rather
                            well. I said both shld know that we are inclined to be absolutely frank
                            in our contact with friendly foreigners and that <gloss
                                target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> has always had such a warm spot in
                            our hearts that we frequently overstep bounds of normal diplomacy in our
                            efforts be of genuine assistance to this new state. I reminded them
                            however that they shld not let any of their colleagues or assistants
                            gain impression from our attitude that there is any lack of cohesion
                            amongst us or that there is any way of splitting our intent loyally to
                            serve our govt toward common end. I said we do not resort to bluffing
                            our friends and they understand in turn it is futile to endeavor trick,
                            bluff or blackmail us. I called upon Darma to testify to his chief that
                            my word had always been found absolutely good by <gloss
                                target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> and that I had never let this country
                            down. Darma quickly agreed.</p>
                        <p>I said that with change in govt, and particularly as <gloss
                                target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>s move on <gloss target="#t_MSA1"
                                >MSA</gloss>, my govt will expect me to report developments and my
                            opinion thereof. I assured them my recommendations were regularly sought
                            on all matters under consideration between our two govts and
                            particularly on such questions as financial and econ aid, whether under
                                <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss>, Exim Bank or otherwise, export
                            licenses, priorities, etc. I said overthrow Sukiman govt on pretext
                            secret Subardjo-Cochran agreement had resulted in campaign of criticism
                            against my govt and my Emb which was far from pleasant. I said my govt
                            wld watch with interest to see whether this attitude continues or
                            changes under new regime. I stated frankly that Mukarto’s public
                            statements with respect desire build up relationships with Commie
                            countries and criticism by Sumitro and other Ministers of alleged
                            failure US give <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> helpful econ
                            support naturally have attracted attention in my country. It will be my
                            duty keep my govt informed as to what trends may follow in govt policy
                            and public reaction thereto.</p>
                        <p>I asked Mukarto whether it was his impression following his return here
                            that <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> genuinely wants <gloss
                                target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> aid and that this is contributing to
                            gen welfare of country. He replied affirmatively but said polit
                            considerations made it necessary be cautious in regard to terms under
                            which such aid cld be accepted. I reiterated US desire to help <gloss
                                target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> in every appropriate and possible
                            manner that may be found acceptable and may be appreciated by this
                            country. I strongly denied however any desire on our part to press aid
                            upon <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> which wld be unwelcome or
                            embarrassing. Darma referred to some statement in book by Geo Kennan to
                            effect US practiced patronizing <pb n="287" xml:id="pg_287" facs="0307"
                            />policy toward Far Eastern countries. Darma said we understood Cong and
                            Govt must defend taxpayers but that our attitude sometimes worried
                            Asians. I said we took every possible precaution to recognize and
                            respect sensibilities of this area.</p>
                        <p>I then asked precisely what steps <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>
                            Govt intends to take if it is learned from Ali that US does not oppose
                            approach towards substitution 511 (b) for (a) but reserves decision as
                            to acceptability such change until US Govt may canvass various opinions
                            in the premises and weigh pertinent factors that may obtain. I asked
                            whether Wilopo Govt would defend 511 (b) type agreement before Parl.
                            Mukarto stated he wld do his part. He thought Parl wld ratify 511 (b)
                            agreement of Burmese type. I asked if there was any prospect of Pres
                            Sukarno or <gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> Hatta making public
                            statement appreciation US aid following example Nehru. Darma intervened
                            to state I shld know their sentiments so well that such statement not
                            necessary. I told him I had vouched personally for <gloss
                                target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> sentiments over several years. I now
                            thought it devolved upon <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>,
                            particularly in light congressional legis and <gloss target="#t_Indo1"
                                >Indo</gloss> attitude on Subardjo-Cochran agreement, to act and
                            speak in such manner as to convince US that continuing aid is desired
                            and warranted.</p>
                        <p>I asked what consideration if any was being given to seeking ratification
                            basic agreements referred to in <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss>
                            exchange of types. Mukarto and Darma explained that whole question of
                            what agreements and notes to be regularly submitted by FonOff for
                            ratification was being studied urgently by <gloss target="#t_MIN1"
                                >Min</gloss> of Justice and legal section FonOff. Upon pressing this
                            point I found that <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>s cld not say
                            that they intended to seek ratification of basic agreements or of <gloss
                                target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> assurances in whatever type latter
                            might be formulated. They cld not tell me when definite legal opinion
                            wld be given which wld control their acts.</p>

                            is not “to avoid Amb Cochran” but rather “to avoid embarrassment” which
                            Amb Cochran might feel at being asked amend agreement which he himself
                            had previously negotiated. Allison said he saw no reason expect
                            embarrassment to Amer Amb. He declared that from US Govt pt of view it
                            wld not only be normal procedure to have Amb Cochran handle proposed
                            negots but also particularly desirable in view Amb’s long experience

                        <p>5. Re mil assistance it was made clear that grant aid now being supplied

                                    that this note will be published by US on June 30 together with

                                    time to publish note and, of course, its own reply.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>I cannot predict that <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> Govt will
                            give clearly favorable, clearly unfavorable, or indeed any reply at all
                            to such. But I feel that by thus getting the Amer position on the record
                            in a manner that will lead to widespread local publicity, we stand our
                            best chance of having the inevitable continuation of local debate
                            directed toward relevant rather than irrelevant and deliberately
                            distractionary [<hi rend="italic">distracting</hi>?] issues. And I
                            believe that by clearly making the <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss>
                            program contingent upon some clarification of <gloss target="#t_Indo1"
                                >Indo</gloss> stand and some indication of <gloss target="#t_Indo1"
                                >Indo</gloss> support, we gain a chance of achieving a meaningful
                            and popular program. At worst, I believe that this formula gives
                            face-saving escape for both <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> and
                            US—in other words, the natural death of the program for lack of <gloss
                                target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> effort at revival. <gloss
                                target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>s prefer in this order: No decision,
                            decision thrust upon them, decision implicit in not deciding. This
                            formula provides for either of last two, and local pressures resulting
                            from publication of note may weigh in favor of taking the decision
                            suggested to them.</p>
                        <p>I request Dept comment and decision. Wld draft note in such manner let it
                            be understood US position necessitated legal requirements and am
                            endeavoring avoid impression undue pressure or impatience. Will
                            appreciate Dept’s draft or suggestion. I make this recommendation
                            because I feel it is absolutely imperative we get this business on legal
                            and moral basis before proceeding with new aid program under State Dept
                            responsibility, and that <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> Govt

                                        <p>“It is my humble view that the transmittal of a note to
                                            the Indonesian Government along the lines contained in
                                            the suggested note from Djakarta could result only in
                                            achieving the crystal clear objective of the Ambassador,
                                            ‘the natural death of the program’.</p>
                                        <p>“I do not see why the Ambassador finds objectionable a

                                            think that the Ambassador is confusing the antagonisms
                                            which have arisen between himself and portions of the
                                            government with a view that this represents basic
                                            antagonisms between the Indonesian Government and the
                                            United States Government on the issue of the
                                            continuation of an economic assistance program.”

                                    Andrews plans to be in Djakarta early in July. You are also
                                    aware, I am sure, that the Department succeeded in retaining
                                    responsibility for the Point 4 program in the face of
                                    considerable opposition in Washington. In his capacity as

                                    the full authority of the Secretary on matters relating to Point
                                    4 and will wish to discuss the Indonesian program with you. I
                                    know that you will give him your wholehearted cooperation and

                                    the Department are aware of the fact that you had certain
                                    reservations about the aid program as previously carried out by
                                    the Mutual Security Agency. I know that you and Mr. Andrews will
                                    be able to resolve any remaining reservations which you may
                                    have, so that there may be a complete meeting of minds and basic
                                    agreement with regard to this future program. The Secretary and
                                    I count upon you to assist in every possible way.</p>
                                <p>“I had hoped that this letter would reach you before Mr. Andrews
                                    arrives, but I find that the pouch schedule is such that this is
                                    impossible. I have, therefore, asked Mr. Andrews to hand it to

                            that (1) US aid program for <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>

                        <p>Andrews explained Cong action which removed <gloss target="#t_Indo1"
                                >Indo</gloss> from <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> field of
                            operations since no defense support involved in program. He said US
                            prepared to carry out through <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss>
                            commitments made 1951 and 1952 under <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss>. It was made clear, however,
                            that <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> was not being imposed
                            unilaterally on <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> and that inception
                                <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> functioning and initiation 1953
                            program thereunder dependent entirely upon answers and attitude <gloss

                            position.</p>
                        <p>Andrews described <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> as instrument for
                            carrying out Pres Truman’s original concept of Point Four aid. He said
                            Act for Internatl Development was basic legis under which <gloss
                                target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> operates. He said <gloss
                                target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> comes within Mutual Security Program
                            and Mutual Security Acts are omnibus measures for all types aid and
                            appropriations therefore.</p>
                        <p>Cochran stated that no new basic bilateral agreement required to replace
                            that of Oct 1950. He said some exchange of letters might conceivably be
                            required to effect such amendments as developments warranted. He took
                            this precaution since <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>s cld look
                            upon simplest exchange of notes as formal agreement requiring
                            parliamentary ratification, and were being very persistent in
                            endeavoring <pb n="298" xml:id="pg_298" facs="0318"/>exact categoric
                            statement that “no further agreement required”. Cochran also explained
                            that assurances under Sec 511 of <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> Act
                            1952 legally required for grant assistance of any character whether
                            under <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_TCA1"
                                >TCA</gloss>. Andrews asked whether <gloss target="#t_Indo1"
                                >Indo</gloss> Govt wld be embarrassed by requirements give
                            assurances.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> replied there now exists in
                                <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> Parl, press and public so much
                            adverse sentiment toward anything connected with Mutual Security Act
                            that any ref to <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> wld constitute such
                            insuperable obstacle to acceptance <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss>
                            that his govt wld not be willing to recommend it. <gloss
                                target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> said that while he himself
                            favored US aid he cld not ignore psychological factors of <gloss
                                target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Section 2.</p>
                        <p>Cochran asked if this meant unwillingness to go along with informal
                            approach Ali had made toward possibly seeking substitution of Burma type
                            511 (b) for 511 (a) assurances given by <gloss target="#t_Indo1"
                                >Indo</gloss>s. Darma said that <gloss target="#t_Indo1"
                                >Indo</gloss> position had shifted just as US position has changed
                            through legis necessitating transfer <gloss target="#t_Indo1"
                                >Indo</gloss> from <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> to <gloss
                                target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> operating field. Andrews stressed fact
                            growing satisfaction many other sovereign states with <gloss
                                target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> programs and their declining
                            unhappiness over having been obliged give any assurances.</p>
                        <p>Zain proposed “neutral” form reply to US approach. He wished eliminate
                            all ref to Mutual Security Act, Mutual Security Program, 511 (a) 511 (b)
                            and so on, and confine himself solely to mention of <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as he said Burma had done. He thereupon
                            read a draft note of which no copy was given. Note referred to recent
                            conversations between US and <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> Govt
                            officials and to agreement Oct 1950 which <gloss target="#t_Indo1"
                                >Indo</gloss> Govt regarded basis for receipt of aid. It continued
                            that <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> Govt reaffirmed its adherence
                            to principles of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter and its
                            intention work through <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> for
                            preservation world peace and friendship. Zain asked whether such note
                            wld be satisfactory to US Govt for continuation of aid.</p>
                        <p>Cochran replied that he wld submit to Dept for consideration whatever
                            reply <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> Govt might care to give. He
                            remarked that this draft made no reference to Emb note of June 30. He
                            was not clear whether “conversations” were those held in Wash or
                            Djakarta or both. He uncertain whether his govt wld accept such note in
                            lieu separate communications, one of which shld constitute a formal 511
                            assurance of some type and the other a reply to Emb note of June 30.
                            Cochran stressed his sincere desire find basis for working out useful
                            aid program for <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> in such manner as
                            to end mutual embarrassments.</p>
                        <p>Hanna pointed out that if such letter were accepted it wld have to be as
                            an assurance under 511 (b) and so reported to Cong. This cld not be
                            hidden.</p>
                        <pb n="299" xml:id="pg_299" facs="0319"/>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> said he wld have to clear
                            letter with Cab. If cleared by Cab and accepted by US he wld be ready
                            submit it to Parl for approval. Cochran reminded him that 1950 agreement
                            still not ratified. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> said wld
                            submit it well as letter.</p>
                        <p>Darma interposed to stress difficult political-psychological factors with
                            which <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> Govt has to contend.</p>
                        <p>Andrews then inquired whether, speaking quite frankly, it was wish of
                                <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> Govt, since program causing so
                            much embarrassment, that it be stopped.</p>
                        <p>Section 3.</p>
                        <p>Zain summarized situation thus: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>So far as <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> Govt
                                    concerned, 511 (a) agreement still valid.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>On Amer side program now shifted from <gloss target="#t_MSA1"
                                        >MSA</gloss> to <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss>, thus
                                    introducing new factor into situation.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>Projects are already underway in <gloss target="#t_Indo1"
                                        >Indo</gloss>. Program, he said can continue. What is
                                    necessary now is some polit maneuvering.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Andrews remarked he was interested in program of tech coop and wished it
                            cld be removed from politics. He stated for such program to work, two
                            nations must work together. It was case of working together or
                            dissolving program.</p>
                        <p>Zain said program cld proceed, or if US Govt preferred, it cld stop
                            program for time being and await developments.</p>
                        <p>Andrews stated US Govt prepared to carry out all its commitments or it
                            was prepared to stop program “as of today” depending upon expression of
                            desire on part <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> Govt.</p>
                        <p>Cochran inquired whether he cld expect hear further on subj prior to
                            departure Andrews on Tues morning 15th. He inquired whether matter wld
                            be submitted to Cabinet for decision prior 15th.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Mukarto said it was impossible
                            Cabinet shld reach decision so soon, but Cochran wld receive some
                            indication of attitude prior to Andrews’ departure, since Mukarto wld
                            consult at least with <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>. Perhaps
                            he could consult with Cabinet. Zain said in any event <gloss
                                target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> Govt wld give it reply whether
                            program shld continue or not under present circumstances.</p>
                        <p>Cochran was called to FonOff forenoon 14th and recd by Darmasetiawan with
                            Zain present.</p>
                        <p>Darma said he was speaking on behalf of <gloss target="#t_FonMin1"
                                >FonMin</gloss>. He said “<gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>
                            reviewed our conversations of 11th with <gloss target="#t_PriMin1"
                                >PriMin</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> supported
                                <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>’s opinion that it wld be
                            hard to accept even 511 (b). This will be sense of <gloss
                                target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>’s report to Cabinet. Question
                            still open was to sending letter of neutral type as drafted by Zain.”
                            Cochran told Darma he would forward promptly to his govt such
                            communication as he might receive after Cabinet decision. Cochran <pb

                        <p>4. In this connection, Ali stated he had recd strict instrs from his Govt
                            to present a note which made clear that chief <gloss target="#t_Indo1"
                                >Indo</gloss> difficulty is with <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss>
                            Act. He said it wld be most helpful if his Govt cld report to <gloss
                                target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> Parliament that it is “in no way
                            bound” under <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> Act. If such a
                            statement cld be made, he said it wld “solve all our problems about
                                <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss>”. Allison replied that no
                            sovereign state is “bound by” legis of another. He said that if US Govt
                            chooses to consider that proposed draft <gloss target="#t_Indo1"
                                >Indo</gloss> note meets purposes of sec 511 (b), this is unilateral
                            US decision taken on sole responsibility US Govt. Similarly, if <gloss
                                target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> Govt decides present draft note, this
                            wld be unilateral decision <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> Govt
                            and <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> Govt wld be “bound” only by
                            existing Econ and Technical Bilateral Agreement and to commitments
                            specifically made in proposed draft. It was pointed out that latter
                            commitments consist entirely and solely of reaffirmation of existing
                                <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> internatl obligations.</p>
                        <p>5. Ali replied that he understood <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>
                            Govt cld say to <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> Parliament that
                                <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> Bilateral of Oct 1950 and
                            proposed exchange of ltrs wld be entire extent of <gloss
                                target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> commitments to US re technical aid.
                            It was suggested to Ali that there are several alternative methods of
                            handling new agreement. One such alternative wld be possibility use text
                            of proposed exchange of notes as amendment to Econ and Technical
                            Bilateral, and subsequently withdraw Jan 5, 1952 agreement in separate
                            exchange. Ali stated he wld want to give further thought to entire
                            problem but that he did not believe there wld be difficulty in reaching
                            mutually satis solution.</p>
                        <p>6. Ali volunteered his understanding that his talks at Dept only
                            exploratory and that final agreement to be handled Djakarta. It was
                            agreed by Allison and Ali that latter’s note of July 28 wld be
                            temporarily regarded as informal and unofficial provisional draft and
                            that Ali wld consult with his own Govt and wld confer later <pb n="308"
                                xml:id="pg_308" facs="0328"/>with Dept re alternative note. Allison
                            gave Ali informal paper containing suggestions for possible use this
                            connection, being supplied Emb in separate <gloss target="#t_msg1"
                                >msg</gloss>.<note n="3" xml:id="d211fn3">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>7. Re mil assistance, Ali emphasized its Govt’s desire continue
                            Constabulary Agreement of Aug 15, 1950 and his Govt’s understanding that
                            grant assistance thereunder wld necessarily term on date <gloss
                                target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>-US Jan 5 Agreement replaced by new
                            exchange notes under sec 511 (b) instead of 511 (a). Ali said he
                            understood undelivered balance constabulary equipment wld be made
                            available his Govt on reimbursable aid basis: “My Govt wld pay cash to
                            your Govt”. Allison replied this correct (para 3 <gloss
                                target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 83 Jul 17), although it wld
                            probably be necessary to receive written request for this purpose from
                                <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> Govt, and certain legal
                            assurances in Jan 5 Agreement wld probably have to be supplied in other
                            forms. Allison added, with specific ref to third para <gloss
                                target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> Amb’s note, that Constabulary
                            Agreement Aug 15, 1950 may continue valid until terminated by an option
                            either party three months notice, but that statement Constabulary
                            Agreement, “not related to <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss>”, is
                            possibly ambiguous. Obviously any implementation this Agreement wld be
                            subj to provisions of <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> Act.</p>
                        <p>8. In subsequent comment to Dept officer, Ali said he felt much reassured
                            by Allison’s exposition of precise limits to which <gloss
                                target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> wld be “bound by” proposed new
                            agreement. He said, “I hope I can make my Govt understand this”. He gave
                            strong impression sincere desire avoid break in continuity technical aid
                            program.</p>

                            believe it important, particularly in fields education and labor that
                            there be no abrupt termination of these programs and therefore suggest
                            that while every effort be made to transfer responsibility for them
                            elsewhere, sufficient funds be allocated to program so that if

                            force and therefore resume discussions with Indonesians on development
                            of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953 program? This long delay in

                            together with such events as reported in ur 411 lead me to wonder

                            beginning to reconsider its attitude toward 511 (a) Agreement and in

                            case, I believe we shld do nothing to make it difficult for this to
                            happen, and in this connection I am not at all certain now is time to

                            reported latest developments in negotiations so far as I am aware. To
                            account of my meeting with Mukarto I added recommendations which I felt
                            if followed would protect Department from any possible charge of neglect
                            in seeking proper legal basis for its granting of aid to <gloss
                                target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> and in requiring assurances
                            prescribed therefor by Cong.</p>

                            for discussing aid question with Mukarto and fact he had months ago
                            transferred negotiations thereon to Ambassador Ali and Department, I did
                            not feel free to question instructions which he said he had sent Ali or
                            to endeavor ascertain his reaction to any reservations that my govt
                            might see fit to raise, along line of my specific suggestions or
                            otherwise. Mukarto’s attitude was certainly one of confidence that Dept
                            would be glad to meet his terms. From <gloss target="#t_Deptel1"

                            maximum we could feasibly exact from <gloss target="#t_Indo1"

                            amend and then ratify Hatta agreement, rather than insist on new
                            agreement based on latest legislation. I cannot tell how <gloss

                            until they may be faced with the choice. But I strongly feel that we are
                            leaving ourselves open to trouble if we give any future military aid,
                            either grant or reimbursable, in absence of any <gloss target="#t_Indo1"

                        <p><gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>s apparently willing finally to
                            submit <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> agreement for ratification if
                            they get what they consider acceptable arrangement on assurances.
                            However, time when we could accept <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>
                            oral undertakings or promises of future action is past. I have
                            repeatedly urged that we assist <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>s
                            reach clear cut decisions by obliging them either comply with normal
                            contractual and congressional requirements or have aid terminated.</p>
                        <p>For US now to accept Mukarto’s conditions for <gloss target="#t_Indo1"
                                >Indo</gloss>s accepting our aid may grant short term advantage to
                            Wilopo govt. Whether long term interests of <gloss target="#t_Indo1"
                                >Indo</gloss> and US relations therewith will best be served by
                                <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> giving up benefits of 511a and
                            appearing before world as irresponsible on contracts is surely open to
                            question. The new arrangement might be an unfortunate precedent for both
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>Wibisono, Sukiman, Subardjo and Djuanda are among moderate leaders who
                            have recently come out in open favoring orientation toward West and
                            particularly US. Wilopo and Mukarto have also deprecated possibility of
                            obtaining aid from Commies and favored accepting aid from those who can
                            give it. It remains to be seen how sincere Wilopo govt will be in
                            following up more reasonable attitude toward US. Admitted
                            disillusionment over possible benefits from dealings with Commies, plus
                            concern over internal security, unbalanced budget and deteriorating
                            balance of payments should increasingly cause <gloss target="#t_Indo1"
                                >Indo</gloss>s realize genuine interest lies in close and amicable
                            relations with US. They will of necessity approach us for many favors in
                            foreseeable future.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that this is not time to be weak and indulgent and incur
                            further disrespect on part of <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>, but
                            to be firm and demand that full respect of which US as great power most
                            friendly to <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> is entitled. I am most

                            are carrying, I should like to see you freed of this soonest possible.
                            But if you are forced into sitting this out until <gloss

                        <p>3. Re Constab Agreement Aug 1950 Allison said some US officials might be
                            inclined suggest advisability cancel this “old agreement” in order
                            replace it with more suitable basis for providing reimbursable aid.
                                <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> Amb declared his opinion “it
                            would be worthwhile to review whole Mil Assistance question” and “make
                            new arrangements” based on specific list to be supplied by <gloss

                            in need heavy weapons”, and cited Constab Chief Sukanto as saying
                            “Constab can not deal with gangs in West Java without heavy equip”. Amb
                            asked if it wld be possible deal with this matter when Dept replies to

                        <p>4. Allison asked Amb’s opinion as to <gloss target="#t_Indo1"
                                >Indo</gloss> Govt’s intentions re Parl ratification of Econ and
                            Tech Assistance Agreement Oct 16, 1950. Amb replied he had no fresh
                            instrs this subject but he reaffirmed his previous “official statement”
                            to Allison that <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> Govt has decided
                            submit this agreement to Parl for ratification. (<gloss
                                target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 1240 May 23 para 2.) Amb
                            volunteered his personal opinion “it wld be wise for (his) Govt to
                            present both Econ Bilateral and new 511b agreement for Parl ratification
                            at same time”.</p>
                        <p>5. Amb said Andrews press statement re $3.1 million for <gloss
                                target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            53 had caused “a lot of resentment in <gloss target="#t_Indo1"
                                >Indo</gloss> press”. He asked if it was “official statement”
                            observing that $3.1 million “wld be a very little amt” in terms <gloss
                                target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> needs. Allison replied above
                            statement not official, since final figure for <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 53 <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> program not yet
                            determined. Bonsal said that undoubtedly amt available for <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 53 program <gloss target="#t_Indo1"
                                >Indo</gloss> wld suffer heavily as a result gen reduction
                            appropriations. He commented, however, that the amt which may be decided
                            upon for current <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> wld probably have
                            minor effect on amt actually spent during this period, in view of
                            sizeable unspent backlog of projects carried over from <gloss

                        <p>6. Allison and Amb Ali confirmed their July 29 decision (<gloss
                                target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 152 para 1) to regard Amb’s July
                            28 Note as unofficial, and they agreed July 28 Note now supplanted by

                        <p>7. <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> Amb concluded by stating his
                            opinion that “polit climate in <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> is
                            now beginning to clear up”. He emphasized his Govt’s wish that matter of
                            Amer aid “be finalized as soon as possible” and preferably before the
                            projected departure of <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>

                            comment on Sept 9 Note at present. He assured <gloss target="#t_Indo1"

                        <p>I explained that only differences between our two govts were over two
                            paras legally required by US and that these provisions were not derived
                            from section 511 of <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> Act, Mukarto
                            replied <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> Wilopo felt very
                            strongly on this point and feared to submit to Parl, “for psychological
                            reasons,” drafts which contain conditions similar to those included in
                            exchange of notes of last Jan. In response to my explanation that Dept
                            of State had yielded on one point after another to achieve agreement on
                            aid program with <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> and was now only
                            asking that minimum requirements established by US law be met, Mukarto
                            insisted there was no possibility of changing Wilopo’s position. Mukarto
                            said he wld not confirm this position in writing until he heard from me
                            further.</p>
                        <p>Mukarto referred to fact he has postponed his departure for UNGA until
                            Oct 15 because of threatened Cabinet crisis. I told him Allison’s
                            schedule had been changed and that Asst Secy will arrive Djakarta
                            evening 15th. Mukarto said he wld have to cancel his trip to US unless
                            Cabinet situation is straightened out and that in any event he will
                            endeavor delay departure to permit his receiving Allison. He promised
                            let me know definite plans soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>Mukarto said <gloss target="#t_Masjumi1">Masjumi</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> working on joint motion as substitute
                            for motion calling for non-confidence in Defense Minister. This joint
                            motion wld seek give Sultan opportunity retain position but accede to
                            request for changes in his ministry and in army leadership. Mukarto said
                                <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> was discussing matter with
                            Sultan in hope latter wld make some early statement which wld ease
                            tension in Parl and permit govt retain Sultan and remain in power.
                            Mukarto doubted success Wilopo’s efforts. He thinks that if Sultan
                            leaves Cabinet, <gloss target="#t_PSI1">PSI</gloss> members will also
                            withdraw. Mukarto said that in this atmosphere Wilopo unwilling take
                            action on <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_TCA1"
                                >TCA</gloss> which he felt likely draw criticism of govt. I then
                            asked if Wilopo wld be willing accept US drafts once crisis is passed.
                            Mukarto said he was sure Wilopo wld not accept them later or in any
                            circumstances since he wld fear attack from Sukiman group in Parl
                            thereon. I told him I wld report promptly to my govt unwillingness
                                <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> govt accept US drafts which
                            include specific legal requirements.</p>

                                            provisions to which Wilopo took exception. I told him I
                                            hesitated to undertake personally or to recommend that
                                            my government try to influence Mukarto or Wilopo toward

                                            downfall of Cabinet or otherwise seriously embarrass
                                            them in this crisis. I wondered if our best service to

                                            Hatta promptly said it should be suspended. We cannot of

                            inability consummate agreement delays consideration of 1953 program. Amb
                            made point, however, that <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> organ

                            received by President Sukarno. At Embassy reception evening 15th Allison
                            met highest Indonesian officials, chiefs of diplomatic missions and

                        <p>Hatta spoke principally of <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> needs
                            for developing roads in Sumatra and improving water transport facilities
                            particularly east <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>. He recommended
                            Allison say nothing on US economic aid question at press conference.
                            Both Allison and Guzzardi thought press conference at <gloss
                                target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> went smoothly. Accounts thereof in

                            reasonably accurate. Early editorial comment favorable.</p>
                        <p>Sukarno presented argument in favor US handling its Far Eastern policy
                            separately from its Western European policy. He was pleased to note
                            change of attitude on Tunisia. He solicited Allison’s help on Irian
                            question. He said that way to win <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>
                            friendship is through political support that touches their hearts. He
                            said <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> must: (1) obtain freedom from
                            union; (2) achieve recognized sovereignty over Irian; (3) send
                            Netherlands military mission home; and (4) liberate itself from
                            Netherlands economic and financial “bondage”.</p>
                        <p>Sukarno said <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> revolution or
                            evolution, whichever you might call it, had not ended and that above
                            steps are essential thereto. He said that if US, acting from its
                            position of strength, should give public statement recognizing <gloss
                                target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> claim to sovereignty over Irian, this
                            would enable him make statements to <gloss target="#t_Indo1"

                            discussions in Djakarta with Cochran, Hagberg and other Emb and <gloss
                                target="#t_STEM1">STEM</gloss> officers both individually and

                            definitely not over. Questions asked me in press conf yesterday by
                                <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> newspapermen definitely
                            indicated deep suspicion that any sort of aid agreement with US had
                            strings attached and wld violate <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332" facs="0352"
                                /><gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> independence. Mukarto told
                            me last night he planned to leave for US on eighteenth and as he has
                            only discussed <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> agreement with Prime
                                <gloss target="#t_MIN1">Min</gloss> there will be no one in Djakarta
                            to defend agreement before Parliament if it is questioned. None of
                                <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> leaders from Pres on down
                            expressed any interest in obtaining early <gloss target="#t_TCA1"
                                >TCA</gloss> agreement—in fact I recd definite impression they wld
                            prefer to let matter slide for moment and do nothing until Cabinet
                            crisis definitely settled.</p>
                        <p>I strongly recommend that timing of next approach to <gloss
                                target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>s be left up to Cochran. He definitely
                            wants to obtain agreement but hopes to do it in manner which will
                            benefit both US and <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>
                            Govt—precipitate action might well have serious adverse effects.</p>
                        <p>In this connection what I have seen in every post visited to date
                            convinces me we have been trying to give too much detailed direction
                            from Wash to field. Officers in charge of all posts visited are
                            unusually competent and they know local situations as we cannot.</p>
                        <p>With respect size of 1954 <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> budget,
                            Cochran will forward Emb and <gloss target="#t_STEM1">STEM</gloss>
                            views. With exception of <gloss target="#t_STEM1">STEM</gloss> labor
                            officer there is unanimity among Emb and <gloss target="#t_STEM1"
                                >STEM</gloss> officers re size and scope of program. My observations
                            lead me to agree that program in neighborhood of $3.1 million and in any
                            case not more than $4 million is largest that can usefully be absorbed.
                            Contrary to my opinion before arrival I am convinced that English

                            Simatupang called into witness. Written petition asked that: (1) Parl be
                            dissolved; (2) Pres take over reins of govt; (3) Army officers guilty of
                            giving military secrets to Parl be punished; (4) Loyal fighters for
                            republic be protected and given redress against federalists who control
                            two-thirds of Parliament; and (5) Petition be published.</p>
                        <p>According Pringgo scene was tearful with army leaders appealing Sukarno
                            who they understood had at outset championed cause their <gloss

                            incident to his own advantage. At very time it was taking place there
                            were tanks on side Palace with guns pointing toward it.) Pres said he
                            did not desire become dictator, would take steps to correct situation,
                            but would not give publicity to petition. This formal written document
                            contained ref to “these demonstrations” which had taken place few
                            minutes before.</p>
                        <p>Later in day several members Parliament placed under “protective arrest”.
                            These included Moh Yamin (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss>

                            These men now released.</p>
                        <p>Detainees had sent letter of appeal to President on morning 18th.
                            President called to Palace Parliament Acting Chairman Tambunan and two
                            deputies. They said Parliament favored govt continuing in office.
                            President asked that Parliamentary steering comite announce Parliament
                            was going into recess and, at request of President, would so remain
                            until unfixed date. Trio returned to their comite and came out with
                            announcement ten days recess, but no reference to President request. He
                            again emphasized seriousness of situation to trio and intimated release
                            of their colleagues hinged on issue of announcement such as he had
                            proposed. Steering Comite acquiesced.</p>
                        <p>President then sent Pringgo to inform Cabinet session of agreement with
                            Parliament. Certain Ministers unhappy, with one threatening to resign,
                            but all finally agreed to carry on. Pringgo then went to home of Sultan
                            and informed him, who according Pringgo was much gratified and satisfied
                            by President’s acts.</p>
                        <p>Press of Sunday morning nineteenth carried announcement which President
                            had stipulated, “at request of President Sukarno Parliament recess

                        <p>After exchange of the usual amenities, the Secretary asked Mr. Mukarto
                            about the present political situation in Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Mukarto replied that the disorders had ended and that everything was
                            again under control. Though social tensions existed, the situation was
                            quiet and a new Cabinet, which he believed was the strongest yet to come
                            into power, was in office. There was agitation <pb n="339"
                                xml:id="pg_339" facs="0359"/>by a large section of the Indonesian
                            public in favor of an elected Parliament. It was hoped that conditions
                            in Indonesia would permit the holding of a general election sometime
                            during the first six months of 1953.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss>
                                Agreement</hi></p>
                        <p>Mr. Mukarto then mentioned the Indonesian desire for the early conclusion
                            of a <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> Agreement. The situation was,
                            however, somewhat complicated because such an Agreement would have to be
                            submitted to Parliament for acceptance. The latter would not ratify an
                            Agreement containing features which would subject the Government to
                            attacks that it was not neutral, or that the Agreement contained
                            obligations to the effect of which would be to align Indonesia against
                            the Communists.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Ali briefly reviewed the course of his negotiations in
                            Washington for a <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> Agreement,
                            observing that substantial agreement had already been reached but that
                            certain legal questions, having largely to do with the phraseology to be
                            used, were still unresolved.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he was glad that such progress had been achieved.
                            He assured the Foreign Minister and Ambassador Ali that it was our
                            desire to arrive at a mutually satisfactory agreement as soon as
                            possible. He did not anticipate any great difficulty in resolving the
                            legal questions outstanding now that an accord had been reached on the
                            substantive questions and made the suggestion that accordingly the
                            negotiations be resumed by legal and technical experts on both sides
                            with a view to reaching a definitive agreement. This suggestion was
                            welcomed by Mr. Mukarto and Ambassador Ali.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">New Guinea</hi></p>
                        <p>The Indonesian Foreign Minister next took up the question of New Guinea.
                            After outlining his Government’s attitude and stressing the interest of
                            the Indonesian public in obtaining a favorable settlement, he asked for
                            the Secretary’s views.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out that New Guinea was a question the solution of
                            which we feel should be worked out by the Netherlands and Indonesia,
                            towards both of which Governments we entertain the friendliest feelings.
                            Any solution which they could work out between themselves would be
                            entirely satisfactory to us. Patience and moderation would be required
                            on both sides since progress towards settlement of such an important
                            question, on which views differed sharply, was bound to be slow. He did
                            not feel that U.S. intervention would, however, contribute towards the
                            solution—in fact, it might only create harm by offending one or the
                            other of our friends.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary said that he was pleased to make known that an increase in
                            the allocation of rice, which had been asked for by Indonesia, would be
                            made. He did not know the exact amount of the increase but suggested
                            that representatives of the Indonesian Embassy place themselves in touch
                            with the appropriate officials in Washington with a view to pursuing
                            this matter further.</p>
                        <p>The Indonesians expressed their pleasure over this development and
                            Ambassador Ali said that the Indonesian Embassy would contact the

                                attachment, not printed, is an excerpt from a statement made by the
                                Netherlands Government to the Second Chamber of the States-General
                                during October 1952. It sets forth the position that <hi
                                    rend="italic">de jure</hi> and <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi>
                                sovereignty over Western New Guinea rested with the Netherlands
                                which would continue to administer the territory under the
                                obligations laid down in Article 73 of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                    >U.N.</gloss> Charter until the inhabitants were able to decide
                                their own future. The Netherlands Government, while willing to
                                assist in conversations on the territory, felt that a resumption of
                                negotiations with Indonesia would serve any useful purpose.</note>
                            He emphasized that the statement was the result of the most careful
                            consideration by his Government and he hoped the Secretary would support
                            the Dutch position. He pointed out that last year the Dutch in their
                            negotiations with the Indonesians had explored every possible approach
                            in a strenuous effort to reach agreement with Indonesia. It had <pb
                                n="341" xml:id="pg_341" facs="0361"/>become absolutely clear,
                            however, that the Indonesians in discussing Western New Guinea were only
                            prepared to talk with regard to the modality of how Western New Guinea
                            was to be turned over to Indonesia. The Netherlands Government was not
                            prepared then and would not be prepared at any time in the future to
                            negotiate on such a basis. Not only was the population of Western New
                            Guinea completely different to that of Indonesia but also the future
                            economic and political development of the area could only be furthered
                            through assurance of continuing Dutch interest and support. Mr. Luns,
                            therefore, urged the Secretary that the U.S. oppose at this time any
                            further proposals in favor of renewing negotiations between the
                            Netherlands and Indonesia with regard to Western New Guinea. It was Mr.
                            Luns’ conviction that negotiations with Indonesia would only worsen the
                            situation rather than help it. The Secretary said that the policy of the
                            U.S. would be to continue to maintain that this question was one that
                            concerned the Netherlands and Indonesia and it was not the policy of the
                            United States to interfere in it.</p>

                            concurrence has adopted fol alternative positions: (1) that US Govt (a)
                            reaffirm its desire have legal provisions included in exchange of notes
                            constituting new Agreement, (b) recognize and attempt meet <gloss
                                target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>’s objection by revising
                            “phraseology” so that these provisions will be simple, clear, no longer
                            worded as in Jan 5 Agreement, and so their complete innocuousness will
                            be obvious. (2) If <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>s find this
                            unacceptable, US Govt wld accept inclusion newly worded legal provisions
                            in separate Note from FonOff as integral part new Agreement.</p>
                        <p>5. Dept officers, acting on first position para 4 above, have informed
                            Maramis (1) that US law does not permit US Govt waive substance legal
                            provisions set forth US draft Notes Sept 29, (2) that US Govt, however,
                            appreciates views <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PriMin1"
                                >PriMin</gloss> on difficulty which these legal provisions may
                            present, (3) that disadvantage these provisions as they appear in Jan 5
                            Agreement may in part have been accounted for by complicated legal
                            wording which obscures their actual innocuousness, (4) that US Govt
                            accordingly suggests and wld be prepared to accept new wording these
                            legal provisions in simplified and clear language. Maramis was handed

                        <p>A meeting was held in Mr. Allison’s office on Tuesday, November 18, 1952,
                            for the purpose of establishing an agreed upon position as to the size
                            of the proposed <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 <gloss
                                target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> program for Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Allison initiated the discussion on the program by indicating his
                            feeling that the internal political situation in Indonesia was best
                            judged by the United States officials on the spot rather than in
                            Washington. He stated that the recommendation which he had made from
                            Singapore for an approximately $4 million program rather than the higher
                            figure of $6.2 million was based on the conversations which he had held
                            in Djakarta with the economic and technical staffs of the <gloss
                                target="#t_STEM1">STEM</gloss> and Embassy as well as with the
                            Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Andrews stated that he fully recognized the need for obtaining the
                            proper political agreement with Indonesia and that it was his strong
                            feeling that if such a proper agreement is achieved that the amount of
                            $6.2 million would definitely be needed to do a genuine program job. He
                            did feel, however, that at the moment the political agreement was the
                            governing factor. He felt also that the amount of assistance which the
                            country could use was virtually unlimited.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Cochran stated that he felt just as strongly today about a
                            small program as he had originally when he had first recommended the
                            program for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 of $3.1 million. He
                            went on to state that the Indonesians were proceeding very slowly in
                            doing what they had to do with respect to the programs and the
                            agreements and that it was his feeling that they would not understand a
                            doubling in 1954 of the $3.1 million figure which had been approved for
                            1953. The Ambassador then proceeded to review in some detail the current
                            political situation in Indonesia with particular emphasis on the recent
                            parliamentary crisis.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bonsal then described a recent meeting which he had had with Minister
                            Mukarto during which Mukarto had expressed enthusiasm for the United
                            States technical assistance program. Mr. Bonsal indicated that he felt
                            some optimism as to the outcome of Mukarto’s representations in Djakarta
                            but was concerned about the delay of at least three weeks before Mukarto
                            would return to Djakarta.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Parelman brought up the matter of the <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1953 program by inquiring as to the opinions of those
                            present about proceeding with the current year’s program in view of the
                            fact that almost five months of the current fiscal year had passed
                            without any action on that program. Mr. Andrews stated that as far as he
                            was concerned the freeze was still on until a political decision was
                            made to relieve <pb n="345" xml:id="pg_345" facs="0365"/>it and he was
                            looking to the Ambassador and <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> to
                            indicate when the freeze should be taken off. The Ambassador stated that
                            he did not feel that the United States ought to retreat from its present
                            position on the freeze. He referred to earlier conversations which he
                            had had in Djakarta and which had been reported to the Department and
                            said that in those conversations the Indonesians had indicated that they
                            do not want to accept <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> assistance
                            under the present 511 (a) agreement. He felt that the next move was up
                            to the Indonesians to get a new agreement and then we would be able to
                            go ahead with the 1953 program. The Ambassador, in response to an
                            inquiry, stated that he did not think it would be necessary to await
                            parliamentary ratification to an agreement with Mukarto but he felt that
                            it was important that Mukarto have the backing of the Cabinet in order
                            to avoid the difficulties which had developed for Subardjo.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bonsal expressed deep concern that because of the <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953 freeze the program might grind to a
                            full stop in many of the projects with a possibility that irreparable
                            damage might be done in fulfilling the program objectives. He inquired
                            as to the legality and feasibility of <gloss target="#t_TCA1"
                                >TCA</gloss> making <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> allotments as it
                            became clear that individual projects would be coming to a close because
                            of lack of funds. The Ambassador felt that the next move was up to the
                            Indonesians. We should hold our ground until they conclude an agreement
                            with the United States for <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953 aid under mutually acceptable
                            assurances. The <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> representatives,
                            responding to Mr. Bonsal’s inquiry, stated that they did not see any
                            legal impediments to using the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953
                            funds inasmuch as an allocation had already been made. Mr. Andrews
                            pointed out that while <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> was prepared
                            to move promptly on the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953 programs
                            it was clear that the Ambassador did not think we ought to go ahead as a
                            matter of principle.</p>
                        <p>In response to a request from Mr. Bonsal, Mr. Andrews stated that he felt
                            they could very readily provide <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>
                            advance information on an <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> basis as it
                            appeared that individual projects would be closed out for lack of
                            funds.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Andrews said that he would like to discuss briefly the matter of the
                            labor program in view of the fact that he had been subjected to
                            considerable pressure from labor interests because of a rumor that the
                            labor projects were being cut out of the Indonesian program. He wanted
                            to clear up any misunderstanding that might exist on that score since
                            their proposed program for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 as
                            well as the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953 program did include
                            provision for certain labor projects. The Ambassador said that while the
                            labor projects as such had been excluded from his 1954 $3.1 million
                            program he felt that they could be taken up under a different label as
                            part of the engineering <pb n="346" xml:id="pg_346" facs="0366"
                            />contract. He would prefer to await the results of the first group of
                            trainees to determine the value of the program. Mr. Hanson confirmed
                            that a program of $4.1 million for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1954 would permit the continuation of the present type of labor
                            projects.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Andrews then brought up the matter of the English Language Institute
                            by saying that this was another program that they would like to settle
                            at this meeting. He said that if everything that he had heard about the
                            manner in which it was being run was true, then the present arrangement
                            was apparently doing more damage than good for United States relations
                            with Indonesia. He said that he was referring to the stories about the
                            misbehavior and internal fighting which apparently had gone on in
                            Djogja. He stated that it was his impression that there was a need for a
                            language program but perhaps the answer would be to arrange for a
                            contract with an educational institution in the United States instead of
                            dealing with individual itinerant teachers. The Ambassador expressed his
                            continuing doubts and reservations as to the validity of this particular
                            program. He did point out, however, that while he had attempted to get
                            the representatives of the Ford Foundation interested in taking over
                            this type of program that they had indicated no desire to do so. He
                            suggested that this operation be discussed further by a technical
                            committee and volunteered to be present if desired.</p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that Mr. Allison had had to leave the meeting early
                            to keep an appointment with the Secretary and a final decision on the
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 program had been delayed
                            pending his return, Mr. Parelman asked if the group was prepared to
                            agree on a final State Department position on the issue of $4.1 million
                            versus $6.2 million for a 1954 program. Mr. Andrews said that in view of
                            Mr. Allison’s position as expressed in his telegram from Singapore and
                            the Ambassador’s feelings about a smaller program, that he was prepared
                            to accede to the political position and agree to a $4.1 million program.
                            No dissent from this figure was offered by any of the others present.
                            Mr. Parelman then stated that he would represent to Mr. Martin’s office
                            that complete agreement had been reached on this figure for <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 by the offices represented at the
                            meeting.</p>

                            is in good health, calm and confident of his ability control situation.
                            He said conference of military Territorial Commanders which met here
                            yesterday moved smoothly and that Colonel Sugeng will remain as Army

                            solution of differences within armed forces is gradually upwards.</p>
                        <p>Sukarno anxious to have my impressions of US following my two months
                            there. He expressed satisfaction over official indication incoming
                            government would give increased attention to Asia and strong hope

                        <p>Sukarno shared with me relief that solution acceptable to Indonesia now
                            being worked out on <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> aid assurances.
                            I told President I had appointment with Foreign Minister Mukarto for 12
                            noon Monday<note n="3" xml:id="d240fn3">Jan. 12.</note> and would then
                            deliver two US notes consummating replace[ment] agreement. President
                            mentioned item quoted in this morning’s Indonesian press from <hi
                                rend="italic">New York Times</hi> indicating Indonesia would be
                            interested in procuring arms in US on reimbursable basis.</p>
                        <p>President asked me for information regarding several chiefs of mission
                            newly named to Indonesia by various European countries. When he
                            indicated particular interest in new Netherlands High Commissioner I
                            said Netherlands diplomatic mission obviously most important in
                            Djakarta. Sukarno quickly reported that it was American and not
                            Netherlands mission that held this place.</p>
                        <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0371"/>
                        <p>I told President I had been impressed by accounts my economic officers
                            had given me of progress Sumitro making on budgetary and financial
                            matters. Sukarno stated Sumitro was good technician. He was not happy,
                            however, over idea of Socialist conference at Rangoon for Asian
                            countries and possible participation therein by Sumitro.</p>
                        <p>I did not venture far into President’s problems on this courtesy call but
                            President did confirm to me in strong terms that explanation which he
                            had given me shortly after October 17 affair was correct, namely that
                            Socialists in collusion with certain military elements were principally
                            responsible (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 769, October

                        <p>Mukarto said he felt his US visit and that of Sidik and other associates
                            had brought better understanding by <gloss target="#t_Indo1"

                        <p>I raised question of publicity on new agreements. Mukarto said he
                            intended give notice to press this afternoon of consummation <pb n="352"
                                xml:id="pg_352" facs="0372"/>thereof. I pointed out that <gloss

                            certain papers of left are already expressing critical interest as to
                            terms of replace[ment] agreement and that pressure would undoubtedly be
                            heavy for release of full details and actual texts. Foreign Minister
                            said he did not expect much opposition as result careful preparation he
                            has made. He said he would submit texts to Foreign Affairs Committee of
                            Parliament at next meeting that group but he did not feel free to make
                            these documents public prior thereto. He promised give me translation

                            effort would be made to get document in Mukarto’s hands before he left
                            US. If this was not possible, Department would transmit document through
                                <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> Embassy Washington. With this
                            understanding and on assumption that such action had been carried out, I
                            proceeded with exchange of notes in Djakarta on January 12 which
                            consummated replace[ment] agreement.</p>

                            “in order not risk disturbing the imminent new <gloss target="#t_MSA1"
                                >MSA</gloss> Agreement.” It had been my firm conviction that it
                            would be both unwise and dishonest to permit <gloss target="#t_Indo1"
                                >Indo</gloss>s replace 511 (a) agreement with one which would not

                                >Indo</gloss>s were fully and specifically informed in advance as to
                            conditions with which they would have to comply to procure military

                            replaced. It was for specific purpose of achieving above-mentioned
                            result with Department that I spent much of my time in Washington. I
                            feel that agreement with <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> has now
                            been obtained in circumstances unfair both to <gloss target="#t_Indo1"

                                believed that friendly but non-committal United States interest at
                                this time might strengthen hand of Mukarto who apparently attempting
                                hold line against Indonesian rubber shipments to Communist China. It
                                is suggested this interest could be shown simply by supplying
                                reimbursable aid draft now pursuant to Mukarto conversation January
                                20. We believe it desirable to take this action as soon as possible
                                and in accordance with our desire to keep aid negotiations
                                concentrated in Djakarta we had hoped you would present the
                                reimbursable aid draft to Mukarto. In view of the above explanation
                                this is still our hope. However if you continue to feel that this is
                                unwise, we are prepared alternatively to give the draft to the
                                Indonesian Embassy in Washington and explain it fully to the
                                Ambassador. Please let me have your comments.<note n="4"

                        <p>Indonesians are likely to remain sensitive and suspicious over course
                            coming year. They will not make decision to join publicly with United
                            States and Western Allies against communism. We are more likely to bring
                            them voluntarily into this position if we <pb n="360" xml:id="pg_360"
                                facs="0380"/>move cautiously and underplay rather than overplay our
                            hand. They may awake to menace of communism if infiltration in
                            Nationalist Party continues and if Communists move too quickly, as they
                            have on occasion in the past. Whether their realization of menace comes
                            as result internal developments, external moves, or simply more
                            realistic Indonesian thinking, we are more likely to be able to
                            capitalize on it if we have been circumspect in past and not made overt
                            moves aimed at pushing Indonesians one direction or the other. Our
                            actions during this period should be aimed at convincing Indonesians
                            they are not vital to United States interests and that it is up to them
                            to show us what they want and what they deserve.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Tomlinson came in at my request today. I thanked him for the oral
                            statement which he had made to me on January 30 with regard to the
                            British position on the Dutch-Indonesian controversy over Western New
                            Guinea. I said that I understood the British position to be (1) that the
                            Indonesians have no valid legal claims to the area; (2) that even if
                            they did, the Indonesians are in no position at the present to take on
                            added responsibilities; and (3) that the British could advocate no
                            course of action which the Australians would regard as inimical to their
                            security (Australian opposition on security grounds to Indonesian
                            occupation of Western New Guinea is well known). Mr. Tomlinson concurred
                            in this summary of his statement.</p>
                        <p>I then said that the US position was as follows: (1) the US has taken no
                            position regarding the validity of the claims advanced either by the
                            Netherlands or by Indonesia to Western New Guinea; (2) while the US has
                            demonstrated in a constructive fashion its concern for the security of
                            Australia, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>’s statement that it
                            “could never endorse any course of action which the Australians <pb
                                n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0381"/>regarded as endangering their
                            security” must be viewed as a unilateral position.</p>
                        <p>I added that I thought we were in agreement with the British regarding
                            the undesirability of having matters come to a head between Indonesia
                            and the Netherlands over this issue. I stated also that the Secretary
                            had made clear in the course of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            Assembly last fall in conversations with the Dutch, Indonesian and
                            Australian Prime Ministers our hope that the problem would be settled by
                            the Netherlands and Indonesia, as well as the fact that it was not our
                            policy to intervene on the question.</p>

                            <item>The internal security problem is a major obstacle to the
                                development of stable government in Indonesia. Suppression of
                                dissident elements has been hampered by political considerations and
                                by the limited effectiveness of the army. However, we believe that
                                no dissident group has the capability of overthrowing the
                                government. If a stable government develops, action against
                                dissident groups will probably become increasingly effective.</item>

                            <item>The strength of the Communists in Indonesia derives from: (a)
                                their position as a major bloc in Parliament; (b) their control of
                                the dominant labor federation; and (c) the presence of some
                                Communists and Communist sympathizers in the armed services, the
                                police, and the bureaucracy. The Communists consequently have the
                                capability to cause serious disruption, though not to overthrow the
                                government by direct military action. The extent of Communist
                                capabilities after the elections will depend, for the most part, on
                                the attitude of the government toward international Communism and,
                                in particular, toward the indigenous Indonesian Communists; the
                                effectiveness with which the government acts to improve economic
                                conditions; and the ability of the government to suppress armed
                                groups and to effectively maintain law and order.</item>

                            <item>The Indonesian economy, which depends heavily upon raw material
                                exports, is presently depressed because of the fall in world
                                commodity prices. The economic situation will continue to be
                                precarious through 1953. Despite the immediate prospect for a
                                continued deficit balance of payments and a continued low level of
                                internal economic activity, a serious economic crisis does not
                                appear likely in 1953.</item>

                            <item>Indonesian foreign policy is chiefly motivated by a desire to
                                maintain an independent position in the world, and by an attitude of
                                neutrality in the East-West struggle. However, so long as
                                Indonesia’s major trade relations remain with the West, Indonesia
                                will probably continue to be closer to the West than to the Soviet
                                Bloc.</item>

                                situation. However, serious difficulties must be overcome, many of
                                which, if not effectively dealt with, might result in a crisis which
                                would seriously weaken, or even result in the collapse of, the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: The Ambassador of
                            Indonesia has asked that the United States Government explore the
                            possibility of sending a military training mission to Indonesia. He
                            envisages a mission of “200 officers” (which in Indonesian usage
                            probably includes non-commissioned officers) to train air, naval and
                            ground forces at Indonesian expense.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador first raised this question personally and informally on
                            April 1. On May 15 he renewed his inquiry under “definite instructions”
                            from his Government. On June 7, the Ambassador left for Indonesia to
                            participate in talks preparatory to forming a new government to replace
                            the Wilopo Government which resigned on June 3. Prior to his leaving,
                            the Ambassador was informed on June 6 that we had not been able to
                            explore fully his inquiry of May 15 and that we could not indicate what
                            our answer would be to a formal request nor make any commitment, but
                            that such a request would receive sympathetic consideration subject to
                            conditions then prevailing. The Ambassador said that he was pleased to
                            know we would not refuse to give a request consideration and that this
                            would help him in the talks he was going to attend.</p>
                        <p>Indonesia has had, since the transfer of sovereignty by the Netherlands
                            on December 27, 1949, a Dutch Military Mission of about 1,000 men.
                            Largely because of persistent Indonesian public hostility to the
                            presence of Dutch military personnel, the two countries have agreed to
                            terminate the Dutch mission by 1954. That mission’s departure is viewed
                            with silent but genuine regret by the Indonesian Chiefs of Staff who
                            realistically appreciated its experienced help <pb n="364"
                                xml:id="pg_364" facs="0384"/>but recognized its political
                            incompatibleness. Any return of the Dutch Military Mission seems out of
                            the question. Indonesia desperately needs a replacement, however.</p>
                        <p>Prior to their approach to us, the Indonesians have informally approached
                            several other non-communist countries, including Australia. From the
                            Indonesian point of view, it appears that all but the latter are unable
                            to provide what Indonesia wants. The Indonesians want one mission from
                            the military forces of a country strong in all three service branches.
                            In the most recent talks on this matter between Australian and
                            Indonesian officials (held at a moment when internal political
                            conditions were fluid in Indonesia), the Indonesians “backtracked”
                            somewhat and after a preliminary study the Australian Defense Committee
                            believes it would be “extremely difficult” to furnish the mission and
                            would be inclined to recommend against it because of shortage of
                            military personnel in Australia. Unless a further request is received,
                            it is understood the Australians will take no further action.</p>
                        <p>Indonesia is faced with the immense problem of organizing former
                            guerrillas into a modern army capable of dealing effectively with the
                            dissident armed groups which continually weaken and threaten the
                            existence of the non-communist Indonesian Government. She will need help
                            in military training and it is in our interest that she get adequate
                            assistance from some country in the free world.</p>
                        <p>If Indonesia were to select the United States as the source of a training
                            mission for its armed services, this action would be widely interpreted
                            as evidence that Indonesia considered its “independence” required
                            alignment with the United States. The Ambassador’s inquiry is therefore
                            a startling and crucial overture.</p>
                        <p>A successful American military mission to Indonesia, at the formal
                            request and with the support of the Indonesian Government, could
                            strengthen that Government and its ties with the United States and bring
                            increased friendship and understanding between the American and
                            Indonesian armed services. The presence of an American military mission
                            in traditionally neutral Indonesia would also have a bracing
                            psychological effect on other countries in Southeast Asia now faced with
                            a critical period as a result of the invasion of Laos.</p>
                        <p>For the United States to rebuff or respond inadequately to any future
                            request would risk paralyzing those groups within the Indonesian
                            Government who prefer the free world and would likely strengthen those
                            who wish to seek help elsewhere. If Indonesia’s need became sufficiently
                            desperate, it is conceivable that an overture would be made to the
                            Soviet Bloc which might be tempted with the prospect of sending a
                            military mission to that large, <pb n="365" xml:id="pg_365" facs="0385"
                            />wealthy and strategic area, as well as by the prospect of a propaganda
                            victory. Conversely, a friendly and sympathetic reply could help
                            Indonesia remain non-communist and draw it another step toward the free
                            world.</p>
                        <p>Although there would undoubtedly be many difficulties, including
                            political, which a United States military mission might encounter in
                            Indonesia, American military training would not be entirely new to the
                            Indonesian armed forces. A number of army and police officers have
                            attended service schools in the United States. Some 60 Indonesian air
                            cadets were successfully trained in the United States under a private
                            contract in 1951. The Indonesian air force has depended almost entirely
                            on a number of American pilots under private contract for the domestic
                            training of its air cadets. On several occasions the Indonesian Chief of
                            Staff for Navy has inquired about training in the United States for
                            Indonesian naval officers.</p>
                        <p>A problem we would have to solve, before making response to a formal
                            request, would be a possibly adverse Dutch attitude to a United States
                            military mission to Indonesia, although the strengthening of the
                            Indonesian Government’s ability to deal with dissidents and the greater
                            security of the non-communist Indonesian Government would appear greatly
                            to the Dutch advantage. Our Ambassador at The Hague, however, believes
                            that there would be strong Dutch objections to an American military
                            mission succeeding the Dutch. Before a final decision is made, the
                            possibility of difficulties with the Dutch would have to be weighed
                            against advantages to be gained from a United States military mission in
                            Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>It is not likely that the Indonesian request will be formalized during
                            the next several weeks pending the formation of a new government. The
                            Indonesians want a replacement mission by the beginning of 1954. It is
                            desirable, therefore, that we get a coordinated view within our own
                            Government of the military and political aspects of the problem which
                            would be posed by a formal request and that we be in a position to act
                            promptly on any new approach.</p>
                        <p>I would be grateful if the Department of Defense would make a preparatory
                            study of the feasibility, from the military viewpoint, of a military
                            mission to Indonesia consisting of 200 United States officers and
                            non-commissioned officers.</p>

                                >PNI</gloss> coalition, as were its third and fourth (Premiers
                            Sukiman and Wilopo). Its second, under Natsir, was a <gloss
                                target="#t_Masjumi1">Masjumi</gloss> cabinet which could not survive
                                <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> opposition. Indonesia’s fifth
                            and current cabinet is for the first time dominated by the <gloss
                                target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss>, which relies heavily on minor, and
                            very mixed, parties such as the <gloss target="#t_PIR1">PIR</gloss>, and
                            the Nahladatul Ulama, and especially on leftist parties close to the
                            PKI, which will probably be very influential although not formally
                            represented. The <gloss target="#t_Masjumi1">Masjumi</gloss> and <gloss

                        <p>The immediate issue which caused the resignation of the Sukiman cabinet
                            June 2, 1953 was a <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss>-PKI challenge of
                            a land redistribution policy being carried out in North Sumatra under
                            the <gloss target="#t_Masjumi1">Masjumi</gloss> Minister of the
                            Interior, Dr. Rum. The <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> group opposes
                            ratification of the Japanese Peace Treaty (as a “pro-western” step in
                            violation of Indonesia’s independent foreign policy), and favors the
                            early establishment of an Indonesia embassy at Moscow. Although
                            Indonesia has steadfastly honored the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            embargo against Communist China, despite a rubber surplus and a rice
                            deficit, the <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> group may move to
                            change this policy. The <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> group favors
                            the nationalization of Shell properties in North Sumatra. On all of
                            these issues it is opposed, in varying degree, by the <gloss

                                >PNI</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_Masjumi1">Masjumi</gloss> strife is
                            reflected in factionalism within the armed forces.</p>
                        <p>President Sukarno, in his surprise acceptance of this one-sided cabinet,
                            is accused of having declared for the <gloss target="#t_PNI1"
                                >PNI</gloss>. Vice President Hatta, and the influential former
                            Minister of Defense, the Sultan of Djokjakarta, are probably opposed to
                            such <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> dominance and certainly to such
                            PKI influence. Prime Minister-designate Ali Sastroamidjojo, who has been

                        <p>The basic issue in the Indonesian political struggle for power is
                            becoming the question of whether or not to cooperate with the

                            The <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> is non-Communist, but apparently

                        <p>I called on the Indonesian Ambassador in order to say goodby to him prior
                            to his departure for Djakarta next Friday. He stated that he will arrive
                            in Djakarta about August 11.</p>
                        <p>After the usual exchange of amenities and courtesies, together with a
                            very sincere expression on my part of regret at the Ambassador’s
                            departure, I said I was glad he was seeing the President on August 6. I
                            inquired whether there was any particular subject which he would like to
                            take up with the President the discussion of which might be facilitated
                            by prior advice. He replied in the negative stating that he envisagad
                            merely a courtesy call and that he would not wish in any way to
                            embarrass the President by bringing up subjects on which the President
                            was not prepared and that, at most, he would merely refer to some of the
                            topics which he has discussed from time to time with his friends in the
                                Department.<note n="1" xml:id="d249fn1">See Part II, section
                                entitled “Respect for Indonesia’s ‘Independent’ Policy,” of <ref

                        <p>I stated that I had been to some extent concerned at press reports
                            regarding the character of the new Indonesian Government which Dr. Ali
                            is to head. I said that I felt these reports, originating from Djakarta,
                            were undoubtedly inaccurate to the extent that they contributed a
                            pro-Communist tendency to the new Government; that I wondered how Dr.
                            Ali accounted for this sort of analysis of the political situation in
                            Indonesia. The Ambassador replied by stating that it was ridiculous to
                            consider that these stories reflected the truth. He stressed that his
                            own position in opposition to Communism was well known and that his
                            party had not forgotten the many victims it had suffered in the Madiun
                            uprising in 1948. He said that, of course, the Nationalist Party is a
                            party which originated in the Indonesian revolution and that it
                            undoubtedly has aspirations which some people characterize as
                            “socialistic” but he expressed in strongest terms the democratic
                            foundation of the party’s philosophy. The Ambassador also referred to
                            his own conviction as to necessity for foreign investment in Indonesia
                            and that the position which he has stated in the United States on this
                            subject continues to be the position which he will further as Prime
                            Minister.</p>
                        <p>Referring again to the press stories regarding the Government which he is
                            to head, the Ambassador said that both the first Vice President
                            Wongsonegoro of the <gloss target="#t_PIR1">PIR</gloss> and the second
                            Vice President Arifin of the Nahladatul Ulama would not have been
                            allowed by their parties to participate in a Government with Communistic
                            tendencies. He said that the first Vice President belongs to a party
                            which draws its strength chiefly from senior public officials who are
                            far from being “Red” and cannot even be described as being “pink”, while
                            the second Vice President belongs to a very old established Moslem crowd
                            of markedly conservative tendencies.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that even without the support of the Communists which
                            had been promised his Government as long as his Government’s policy
                            meets with the approval of the Communists he felt that he would have a
                            small but comfortable majority in the Indonesian Parliament. His
                            calculation seems to have been reached by adding to the 114 votes (of
                            the total 212 votes) controlled by the Governmental parties, the votes
                            of a certain number of independents and of smaller groupings who would
                            not vote against the Government.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then took occasion to state that he had been much
                            concerned at the poor press Indonesia has been receiving in recent
                            months not only with respect to the new Government but also in general.
                            He said that he contributed [<hi rend="italic">attributed</hi>?] this
                            bad press very largely to the activities of reactionary Dutch elements
                            principally businessmen, who, according to the Ambassador, desire <pb
                                n="369" xml:id="pg_369" facs="0389"/>to maintain a monopolistic
                            position in Indonesia by frightening other capitalists who might be
                            inclined to invest there. I expressed surprise and regret at this
                            allegation if true, stating, as I had frequently done to the Ambassador,
                            that it seemed to me that a smooth cooperation between Indonesia and the
                            Netherlands could be extremely beneficial to both countries and that it
                            need not involve the elimination of cooperation between Indonesia and
                            other friendly governments.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador agreed in general to this proposition but stated that
                            unfortunately we must face the fact that there are two issues preventing
                            good relations between Indonesia and the Netherlands, in addition to the
                            hostility of the business interests to which he had referred. These two
                            issues are, first, the Netherlands-Indonesian Union and, second, “Irian”
                            (Western New Guinea). He said that both he and Ambassador van Roijen
                            thought the Union might as well be dissolved since it serves no purpose.
                            The Ambassador took occasion to speak very highly of van Roijen and the
                            personal relations which he enjoyed with him. Turning to Irian, the
                            Ambassador stated that this remained the key issue between the
                            Netherlands and Indonesia. He said, as he has frequently done in the
                            past, that the U.S. by recognizing the legitimacy of Indonesia’s
                            aspirations in the matter could convert the already friendly feeling in
                            the U.S. into a feeling of great sympathy and ardent friendship. He said
                            that he thought we should assume in this matter a clear-cut
                            anti-colonial attitude although he recognized the difficulties of the
                            problem from our point of view. He referred to a recent conversation
                            which he had with the Secretary in which the latter described to him the
                            increasingly successful efforts which we are making to induce the French
                            to drop colonial attitudes in Indochina. He said he hoped we would take
                            some sort of similar attitude in the matter of New Guinea. In reply I
                            outlined for the Ambassador our well known position of neutrality in
                            this matter and the hope that the two parties concerned would work out a
                            solution. He recognized that this hope had been somewhat dimmed by the
                            passage of time. I asked the Ambassador whether in the event that a
                            direct settlement would not appear possible, he envisaged any initiative
                            to secure a settlement on the part of his country by means other than
                            direct negotiation. He made no clear-cut reply, merely reiterating his
                            statement of hope.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador stated, in reply to a question, that it was the policy of
                            his Government to proceed with plans for the holding of elections. He
                            said that the Minister of Justice and other officials were well known to
                            him and he felt full preparations would be activated although the
                            problem from the mechanical point of view is a difficult one.</p>

                        <p>In the course of conversation the question of rubber came up. I expressed
                            appreciation for the economic and political problems which Indonesia is
                            facing as a result of the present state of the rubber market. I also
                            expressed appreciation of Indonesia’s adherence to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution as evidenced by her failure to
                            ship rubber to Communist China. I said that I hoped this attitude would
                            be maintained, particularly through the present highly critical period
                            when it seemed to us and also to other members of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> that any relaxation of measures of this
                            sort would be highly damaging. The Ambassador said that he had received
                            in most vigorous terms a similar statement from Mr. Robertson and he
                            gave every indication of agreeing that no action would be taken at
                            present. The Ambassador also took occasion to express his satisfaction
                            with the recent Congressional legislation on the disposal of synthetic
                            rubber plants and agreed with me that the points which the Indonesian
                            Government has been concerned with are, to some extent at least, being
                            remedied by recent legislation.<note n="2" xml:id="d249fn2">Reference is
                                to S. 2047 and H.R. 5728. H.R. 5728 was subsequently enacted into
                                law as the Rubber Producing Facilities Disposal Act of 1953,
                                approved Aug. 7, 1953. (67 Stat. 408)</note></p>
                        <p>In closing, I said that while it would be difficult to replace him as
                            Ambassador, I hoped that his Government would not delay in the selection
                            of his successor as long as we have delayed in finding a successor for
                            Ambassador Cochran. He replied that he would give the highest priority
                            to the appointment of a new Indonesian Ambassador here and that he hoped
                            it would be possible to make a prompt and highly suitable selection. He
                            said also that one of the first orders of business upon his return would
                            be the consideration of our request for an agreement for a new American
                            Ambassador to Indonesia. I expressed appreciation and said that the
                            person in question was an old personal friend of mine and that I thought
                            he would do a very good job in Indonesia. This remark was taken in good
                            part by the Ambassador.</p>

                            23 June 1953 to the Secretary of Defense concerning the request by the
                            Ambassador <pb n="371" xml:id="pg_371" facs="0391"/>of Indonesia that
                            the United States Government explore the possibility of sending a
                            military training mission to Indonesia. It was requested by the
                            Department of State that the Department of Defense make a preparatory
                            study of the feasibility, from the military viewpoint, of a military
                            mission to Indonesia consisting of 200 United States officers and
                            non-commissioned officers.</p>
                        <p>This matter was referred to the Joint Chiefs of Staff for their
                            consideration. They have stated their belief that the establishment of
                            the United States military mission to Indonesia would be in consonance
                            with policy set forth in paragraph 17 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> 124/2<note n="1" xml:id="d250fn1">See <ref

                            and such a mission would contribute materially to the organization and
                            development of the armed forces of Indonesia and would facilitate the
                            establishment of a more comprehensive military liaison than now exists
                            between the two countries.</p>
                        <p>They stated further that although the desired composition of the mission
                            has not yet been indicated, it is believed a mission of 200 would be too
                            large, and that no commitment regarding size of the mission should be
                            made at this time. It is felt that qualified personnel for a suitable
                            mission can be made available and that approximately four months would
                            be required for instruction and orientation of the personnel selected
                            for assignment to the mission.</p>
                        <p>It is the opinion of the Department of Defense that the assignment of a
                            United States mission to Indonesia is feasible from a military point of
                            view.</p>

                            <p>Part I is a “Survey of the Current Political Situation in Indonesia”
                                which states that: (1) The new cabinet is probably influenced, but
                                by no means dominated, by communists. (2) The Moderates are
                                politically and militarily too strong for the communists to take
                                over the government now. (3) The new cabinet’s threat to our
                                objectives lies less in the likelihood of new Indonesian policy than
                                in the opportunity it presents for gradual communist infiltration.
                                (4) It is too early to tell the cabinet’s course of what changes in
                                our policy may be necessary and effective. (5) Pending <gloss

                                Part II, “United States Courses of Action Toward Indonesia”, are:
                                (1) respect for Indonesia’s “independence”; (2) neutrality in the
                                New Guinea dispute; (3) responsiveness to Indonesia’s rubber and tin
                                export problems; (4) personal influence; (5) grant economic aid; (6)
                                readiness to extend reimbursable military aid, and to give
                                sympathetic consideration to a formal request for a military
                                training mission, subject to conditions then prevailing.</p>

                                        do not reveal leftist membership in the PKI. This is a real

                                        so in the future. Kusumasumantri, for instance, refused to

                                        “Communist-dominated” cabinet, his talk was unexpectedly
                                        mild and his approach to domestic problems constructive. He

                                        His comment on Western New Guinea was less violent than
                                        heretofore. He referred to the “good” relations between

                                        significance is that it sharpens the issue between
                                        Communists and non-communists, despite the characteristic
                                        Indonesian desire to remain “neutral”. Born with the
                                        approval of the PKI and the hostility of the moderates, it
                                        steps up the polarization between them. Non-communists are
                                        being forced to become increasingly anti-communist. Among
                                        the major forces in Indonesia, the PKI clearly occupies the

                            <p>The Indonesian Government, inspired by nationalism, wary of any
                                foreign influence, and afraid of involvement in the conflict between
                                the United States and Russia, pursues a sensitive policy of
                                “independence” in its foreign relations. To strengthen the
                                non-communists, who so far have held the political and military
                                leadership in the Indonesian Government, the United States has
                                attempted in action and in speech to set forth its respect for
                                Indonesia’s independence.</p>
                            <p>This attitude was illustrated in the United States handling of
                                difficulties which arose under the Mutual Security Act. In an
                                exchange of notes with the American Ambassador January 5, 1952,
                                Indonesia’s Foreign Minister gave assurances under Section 511(a) of
                                the <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss>, in order to continue
                                programs of economic and military grant aid. That “511(a) Agreement”
                                became widely misunderstood and suspected as a violation of
                                Indonesia’s independent policy, and precipitated the fall of the
                                Sukiman Cabinet. The Indonesian Government nevertheless honored its
                                commitment, and the succeeding Cabinet under Premier Wilopo asked to
                                replace it with assurances under Section 511(b) which would continue
                                grant economic but discontinue grant military aid. The new agreement
                                was signed January 12, 1953, after having been foretold in the
                                Indonesian press and announced by President Sukarno to Parliament.
                                The United States action in permitting the <gloss target="#t_MSA1"
                                    >MSA</gloss> agreement to be renegotiated not only removed a
                                large part of the public suspicion of American aid, but also gave
                                evidence that the non-communist Indonesian Government was in fact
                                able independently to negotiate on the basis of equality.</p>
                            <p>On August 6, 1953, President Eisenhower gave the United States

                                that the new Indonesian Cabinet was dominated by Communists, the

                                unsettled and has become a highly sensitive issue in both countries.
                                The Netherlands, strongly backed by Australia, continues to
                                administer New Guinea. Both sides have solicited United States

                                President Sukarno and the preponderance of Indonesian political
                                parties concentrate on the New Guinea issue the fervor of
                                nationalism and the fear of resurgent colonialism. The United States
                                has pursued an avowed policy of neutrality in this issue.</p>

                            <p>Falling rubber prices are a most serious obstacle to the United

                                exceeding 700,000 long tons, accounts for about 40 percent of the
                                world’s production. As Indonesia’s biggest customer, the United
                                States gets the blame for the decline which has followed the Korean
                                war boom. Natural rubber brings in about 46 percent of Indonesia’s
                                foreign exchange earnings and over 11 percent of government
                                receipts. It is the main livelihood of hundreds of thousands of
                                “small-holders” whose sales are hardest hit by falling prices, and
                                whose susceptibility to communist propaganda is increased by the
                                resulting economic hardship. Trying to remedy these real political
                                and economic problems, the Indonesian Government has advocated
                                international rubber stabilization and has sought United States
                                assistance with regard to the latter’s rubber policy.</p>
                            <p>The United States has responded factually and as sympathetically as
                                possible. In 1951 the General Services Administration offered a
                                large-scale, two-year contract which Indonesia, much to its present
                                regret, turned down in favor of an 18-month contract for 15,000 tons
                                which was completed in March, 1953. At the Copenhagen Meeting of the
                                Rubber Study Group in May, 1953, the United States avoided opposing
                                a proposal to call a rubber stabilization conference, although the
                                United States said it did not at that time see the economic need for
                                a commodity stabilization agreement. This enabled the Indonesian
                                delegate (Sadjarwo, Minister of Agriculture in the present cabinet)
                                courageously to deny subsequent widespread charges that the United
                                States had opposed stabilization. The U.S. manufacturers at the
                                Meeting made a statement which was construed as an expression of
                                willingness to take any surplus of natural rubber off the market
                                during the next 12 <pb n="379" xml:id="pg_379" facs="0399"/>months.
                                In its long note of May 4, 1953, the Indonesian Government expressed
                                interest in several points concerning synthetic production as
                                related to the price of natural rubber. The United States has since
                                replied referring to favorable action on major points such as the
                                cutting down of alcohol-base production August 1, 1953, and the
                                passage of legislation providing for the disposal of the synthetic
                                plants to private industry.</p>

                                Mission</hi></p>
                            <p>The Netherlands Military Training Mission, of about 1,000 men, which
                                has remained in Indonesia since the transfer of sovereignty, will
                                have been terminated by the close of 1953. Its departure is dictated
                                by Indonesian popular political suspicions of the Netherlands, and
                                regretted by the Indonesian Chiefs of Staff who are keenly aware of
                                its value. Indonesia has unsuccessfully sought a replacement from
                                West Germany and Australia, who have been informally advised by the
                                Netherlands that it would not favor an affirmative response. Just
                                after the Laos invasion, Indonesia formally asked the United States
                                to explore the possibility of sending a 200-man military training
                                mission. The United States has replied it would give a formal
                                request for a mission sympathetic consideration subject to
                                conditions then prevailing. The Department of Defense on August 27,
                                1953, has stated that it considers the dispatch of a military
                                training mission to Indonesia to be militarily feasible.
                                Furthermore, the Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that the dispatch of
                                such a mission would be in consonance with paragraph 17 of <gloss
                                    target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 124/2 and would contribute
                                materially to the organization and development of the armed forces
                                of Indonesia and would facilitate the establishment of a more
                                comprehensive military liaison between Indonesia and the United
                                States. The United States would not consider sending a mission
                                unless it could count on a favorable political reception and the
                                support of the Indonesian Government, at present a remote
                                possibility. A successful mission could be a decisive factor in
                                aligning Indonesia with the free world.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Cutler stated that this report on Indonesia was of extraordinarily
                            high quality and interest. It had been prepared for the information of
                            the Council because of the accession to power of a new government in
                            Indonesia. Mr. Cutler added that a new policy with <pb n="385"
                                xml:id="pg_385" facs="0405"/>respect to Indonesia was in course of
                            preparation and would shortly be presented to the Council.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Flemming<note n="3" xml:id="d252fn3">Arthur S. Flemming, Director of
                                the Office of Defense Mobilization.</note> observed that upon
                            reading the report he had reached the conclusion that our State
                            Department felt that we had a three-year binding purchase agreement on
                            tin with the Indonesian Government. <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss>
                            was not clear as to whether this agreement was binding for two or for
                            three years. It was extremely important that the obscurity be clarified,
                            in view of present stockpiling planning on tin. We were already
                            absorbing more Bolivian tin than the stockpile needed, and if additional
                            amounts of tin were to come from Indonesia, a decision needed to be
                            made.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bowie<note n="4" xml:id="d252fn4">Robert R. Bowie, Director of the
                                Policy Planning Staff, Department of State.</note> indicated
                            agreement that this problem should be settled. So far as he knew, the
                            State Department did take the view that this Government was involved in
                            a three-year contract, and he pointed out the unfortunate repercussions
                            if the United States seemed to be welching on a contract. He indicated
                            that this issue should be clarified in the forthcoming new policy paper
                            on Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Stassen<note n="5" xml:id="d252fn5">Harold E. Stassen, Director of
                                the Foreign Operations Administration.</note> then inquired as to
                            the status of the Indonesian Government’s request for a United States
                            military mission. He indicated his view that such military missions were
                            very desirable, particularly in unstable nations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Cutler pointed out that we had had to move carefully in this matter
                            for fear of offending our Dutch friends, whose military mission would be
                            replaced.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Stassen commented that if we sent a U.S. mission to Indonesia our
                            Dutch friends might well be offended, but they would not go
                            Communist.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bowie and Admiral Radford<note n="6" xml:id="d252fn6">Adm. Arthur W.

                            received a formal request for such a military mission to Indonesia,
                            although Admiral Radford had added that we would be very glad to send
                            such a mission if it were requested.</p>

                            Director of Central Intelligence devoted his briefing of the Council
                            exclusively to the situation in Indonesia. With the assistance of a
                            chart, Mr. Dulles indicated the political complexion of the Indonesian
                            Parliament, which was largely an appointed rather than an elected body.
                            President Sukarno’s selections, moreover, had not been very happy or
                            fair, since the largest Indonesian party, the <gloss
                                target="#t_Masjumi1">Masjumi</gloss>, had been given insufficient
                            representation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Dulles ascribed to inexperience the increasing trend toward a
                            breakdown of governmental authority in Indonesia. He pointed out that
                            the Indonesians, unlike the Filipinos, had had no training in
                            self-government prior to independence. Initially the Indonesians had
                            attempted to create a federal system of government, which was what was
                            required in view of the geographical and other circumstances. They had,
                            however, given up this objective in favor of the present centralized
                            system of government, which simply does not <pb n="389" xml:id="pg_389"
                                facs="0409"/>work. All these circumstances make it difficult to
                            estimate how serious is the danger of Indonesia’s going Communist.</p>
                        <p>There will be no elections until 1955. The electoral commission which has
                            been set up has excluded the <gloss target="#t_Masjumi1">Masjumi</gloss>
                            and the Socialist parties from membership, which indicates that the
                            elections, if they occur, will be rigged. While, said Mr. Dulles, it was
                            not accurate to describe the present Indonesian Government as Communist,
                            at least eight of the twenty cabinet ministers were pro-Communist.
                            Accordingly, the present government could best be described as a Popular
                            Front. The opposition had put out feelers looking to a revolt, but the
                            opposition at present did not command sufficient resources for a
                            successful armed revolt. Meanwhile President Sukarno, who still has very
                            great influence, is apparently convinced that he can control and exploit
                            the Communists for his own purposes. Disaffection in the armed forces,
                            however, remained very great.</p>
                        <p>The major problem in foreign policy remained the question of New Guinea.
                            In the economic realm the Chinese Communists were playing with the
                            rubber issue chiefly in order to stir up trouble. So far the Indonesians
                            had remained faithful to their commitment not to sell this strategic
                            material to Communist China, but there was no certainty that they would
                            continue to observe the prohibition. Worst of all, the United States
                            gets the blame for the falling prices of tin and rubber. The Indonesians
                            tend to class the United States with the Colonial powers. In summary,
                            while the situation was not one of immediate crisis, everything was
                            moving in the wrong direction from the U.S. point of view. The
                            situation, in short, was one of steady deterioration.</p>
                        <p>The President’s first comments on the intelligence briefing consisted of
                            inquiries as to the likelihood of a <hi rend="italic">coup d’état</hi>
                            by the army. He then moved on to question, with some warmth, why it was
                            a matter of such moment to the United States if the Indonesians did
                            undertake to sell all their rubber to Communist China. The President
                            said he got very weary of all these rigid U.S. controls on the trade of
                            free world nations with the Soviet bloc. Why should we not tell the
                            Indonesians to sell their rubber and tin to China instead of having to
                            assume the blame ourselves for the inability of the Indonesians to
                            market the products on which their economy depended? So far as he could
                            see, said the President, Russia has all the rubber she needs, or in any
                            case could manufacture it synthetically. Meanwhile, the United States
                            cannot stand forever in the way of other nations making a living.
                            Obviously the chief obstacle to a more intelligent approach to this
                            problem was the vehemence of popular and Congressional opinion on trade
                            between the free world and the Soviet bloc. Accordingly, what we needed
                            most was a program to educate our own citizens on the facts of economic
                            life.</p>
                        <pb n="390" xml:id="pg_390" facs="0410"/>
                        <p>When the President had concluded his observations, Governor Stassen
                            pointed out that the Joint Chiefs of Staff had listed rubber among the
                            most important strategic materials, which accounted for their policy of
                            preventing its sale to Communist China. If rubber were taken off the
                            strategic list, it would make a very great difference in the volume and
                            character of international trade.</p>
                        <p>In reply the President said that he was not impressed with this argument,
                            and felt that we conducted our policy of trade controls in much too
                            rigid and generalized a fashion. It would be much more desirable to
                            substitute for the present criteria, the criterion of net advantage to
                            the free world and to the U.S. of trade with the Communist nations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Cutler then suggested that this subject be dropped and taken up again
                            in connection with the policy report on Indonesia, which addressed
                            itself to precisely this problem.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Cutler presented the draft statement of policy as one in the series
                            of Far Eastern policy recommendations which had been prepared in recent
                            months by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning Board. He
                            pointed out that the two most difficult issues faced by the Planning
                            Board with regard to Indonesia had been, one, … the present … Indonesian
                            Government … secondly, the character of U.S. assistance to some more
                            satisfactory Indonesian Government if such a government succeeded to
                            power.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Humphrey<note n="5" xml:id="d254fn5">Secretary of the Treasury
                                George M. Humphrey.</note> said he wished to comment at once on the
                            second of these two issues. He pointed out that we already have on hand
                            a stockpile of tin sufficient to last for five years. Meanwhile, the
                            domestic demand for tin was steadily falling, thanks to new equipment
                            and to the use of substitutes. Accordingly, Secretary Humphrey judged
                            that even if the U.S. were to get no tin at all for a number of years,
                            the situation would not be troublesome. To <pb n="391" xml:id="pg_391"
                                facs="0411"/>make matters worse, we seemed to be obligated to
                            purchase another 60,000 tons of tin in addition to the five-year supply
                            already amassed. Thus there was a glut of tin, and anything we did about
                            our supply was bound to get us in wrong with the governments from which
                            we purchased it. If we insisted on buying tin at a reduced price these
                            governments would be sore. If we don’t buy any tin, they will be equally
                            mad. If we sell some of the tin which we have accumulated, the tin
                            market goes to hell. In the circumstances, concluded Secretary Humphrey,
                            it was his recommendation that the United States get itself completely
                            out of the tin business and out of the cartel business. We will buy tin
                            when and where we need it, and let the tin-producing countries sell
                            their tin to anyone who offers to buy it.</p>
                        <p>Governor Stassen, while agreeing with the dark picture Secretary Humphrey
                            had painted, said that the difficulty had resulted from our own frantic
                            purchases of tin in recent years. It was these purchases that had driven
                            up the price and now caused such severe dislocation in the economies of
                            countries like Indonesia and Bolivia.</p>
                        <p>The President also took issue with the arguments of Secretary Humphrey.
                            Unless, he said, we can foresee the complete elimination of tin from our
                            economy, we could not altogether abandon the program for stockpiling
                            this metal. Furthermore, said the President, a country could never be
                            called poor if it owns commodities and things, as opposed merely to
                            money and currency.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Humphrey said he couldn’t agree with the President’s point. He
                            said that he was not a conservationist. He was convinced that we would
                            always be able to obtain all the material resources we needed if we were
                            willing to pay the price, or else we could find substitutes for such
                            materials. Contrary to the President’s point of view, Secretary Humphrey
                            said that people who have too much of a given commodity often go broke.
                            He, in any case, was not frightened of not having sufficient materials
                            to use when we needed them. There would be plenty.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired whether Secretary Humphrey had not overlooked
                            manganese. A few years ago we could have created a much larger stockpile
                            of this material, and such a program would have been very desirable. Now
                            manganese was in short supply and we are searching for it all over the
                            world, with a resultant sharp rise in price.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Humphrey did not answer the President’s argument, but suggested
                            going back to the point made earlier by Governor Stassen. He confessed
                            that Governor Stassen was right in blaming the United States for the
                            glut of rubber and tin which was now causing such difficulty. Our
                            policies had raised the price of these <pb n="392" xml:id="pg_392"
                                facs="0412"/>commodities and occasioned the large production which
                            could not now be disposed of. Nevertheless, we cannot now dissipate our
                            assets in vain attempts to support the economy of Indonesia. If we
                            continue to try to buy up all the significant strategic materials in the
                            world for our own use, or to prevent the Russians from obtaining such
                            materials, the burden would fall with heavy weight on our own
                            taxpayers.</p>
                        <p>Governor Stassen expressed agreement with Secretary Dulles on the
                            interdependence of the United States and the other countries of the free
                            world, and then went back to the President’s suggestion of allowing the
                            Indonesians to sell their rubber and tin to any buyer who appeared. This
                            appealed to the Secretary of State as the most constructive proposal to
                            come out of the discussion thus far. He illustrated the problem by
                            pointing out that when Ambassador Cumming first went to Indonesia he was
                            faced with the disagreeable task of informing the Indonesians that we
                            could neither buy their rubber and tin nor accede to their sale to
                            Communist China.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Dulles stated that while Secretary Humphrey’s analysis might be
                            accurate from a purely tax point of view, it ignored very important
                            political factors. While our policy of buying strategic materials in
                            foreign countries could indeed cause unemployment here and there in the
                            United States, failure to buy such materials might completely destroy
                            the economic stability of certain friendly countries. If this occurred,
                            the price to us would in the long run be much greater. In short, we
                            could not look upon economic assistance to such countries as Indonesia
                            solely from the point of view of the banker.</p>
                        <p>The President then restated his proposal, but suggested that before it
                            was adopted he would like the Joint Chiefs of Staff to make a fresh
                            study, from the military point of view, of the whole matter of trade
                            controls on the sale of strategic materials.</p>
                        <p>Both Secretary Humphrey and Mr. Flemming expressed the need for a sense
                            of urgency in the paragraph of the report which called for exploration
                            of ways and means of providing assistance to the Indonesians in the
                            marketing of their rubber and tin. We were right up against the wall not
                            only on tin and rubber but on a number of other items for which the
                            stockpile was complete. Accordingly, we could no longer justify the
                            purchase of such materials as necessary contributions to the stockpile.
                            Further purchases in fact would simply amount to preemptive buying.</p>
                        <p>The President observed that if we took tin and rubber off the strategic
                            list, the Chinese Communists would either have to buy these items from
                            the Indonesians or else their bluff would be called. In any case, the
                            Chinese Communists would have to take the rap if they broke the market
                            in these commodities. But, said <pb n="393" xml:id="pg_393" facs="0413"
                            />the President, he wished the Joint Chiefs to make the study he had
                            suggested.</p>
                        <p>Governor Stassen pointed out that Admiral DeLany<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d254fn6">Adm. William S. DeLany, <gloss target="#t_USN1"
                                    >USN</gloss> (ret.), Deputy Director for Mutual Defense
                                Assistance Control, Foreign Operations Administration.</note> was
                            administering U.S. policy with respect to the control of the movement of
                            strategic materials, not out of any fear of Congress, but strictly in
                            accordance with the guidance given him by the Department of Defense as
                            to strategic materials. If we changed this guidance and decided to relax
                            controls on trade in strategic materials, Governor Stassen said that
                            Admiral DeLany would be quite prepared to present his case and defend it
                            before the Congress.</p>
                        <p>In support of the President’s argument that this would take the heat off
                            the U.S. and put it on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>,
                            Governor Stassen said that there had been certain indications of late of
                            economic difficulties in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                            the satellites, and the President expressed the hope that if his
                            proposal were adopted it would tend to increase such economic
                            difficulties. By and large, said the President, his proposal was
                            directly related to the basic objective of this Administration, which
                            was to achieve a reasonable balance between the demands of national
                            security and the necessity for economic health and stability in the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>After further discussion of certain amendments to the language in the
                            proposed statement of policy, Mr. Cutler pointed out, as to paragraph
                            29, the view of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that the language of that
                            paragraph was not sufficiently clear to provide the guidance necessary
                            for military planning. While it was clear that such plans involved the
                            possibility of U.S. military assistance to Indonesia in the event of a
                            Communist seizure of power, it was not clear what the United States

                            <p>1. Indonesia is strategically important to the United States and the
                                rest of the free world as a vast archipelago which commands the
                                approaches between the Pacific and Indian Oceans and between Asia
                                and Australia, is inhabited by 80,000,000 people, and is a producer
                                of rubber, tin and petroleum. The loss of Indonesia to Communist
                                control would have serious security implications for the United
                                States and the rest of the free world.</p>
                            <p>2. Immediately effective power in Indonesia is concentrated in the
                                hands of a relatively few thousand leaders. Most powerful among
                                these is President Sukarno, who enjoys a position of unique prestige
                                and popular strength.</p>
                            <p>3. Some of the Indonesia leaders are undoubtedly Communist. At the
                                opposite extreme are some leaders who are unalterably
                                anti-Communist. Between these extremes are the majority of leaders,
                                who are non-Communist but suspicious of, and uncertain that their
                                interest lies with, the West. These by their numbers hold the
                                balance of power between Communists and anti-Communists and must be
                                effectively influenced if United States objectives are to be
                                attained in Indonesia. In all groups there is a very strong legacy
                                of anti-colonial feeling; and sensitivity to any appearance of
                                foreign intervention in Indonesian affairs is greater than in almost
                                any country in the world.</p>
                            <p>4. Indonesia’s internal political life now revolves around two
                                interrelated struggles for power: (a) between the <gloss
                                    target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> (Nationalist Party) and the <gloss
                                    target="#t_Masjumi1">Masjumi</gloss> (Moslem Party), and (b)
                                between the Communists and those subject to their control, on the
                                one hand, and <pb n="397" xml:id="pg_397" facs="0417"/>the
                                non-Communists and anti-Communists, on the other. The first of these
                                struggles has been going on for several years; the intensity of the
                                second has been renewed recently, particularly since the advent of
                                the present <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> government in August
                                1953. Although Premier Ali and the leaders of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> are non-Communist, they have
                                accepted Communist political support, and eight important ministries
                                out of a total of twenty are held by individuals who will probably
                                respond on many issues to Communist influence. The pro-Communist
                                inclination of these men, the aggressive tactics of the Communist
                                Party in calling for military action against Moslem groups, and
                                recent adjustments in key positions in the armed forces have tended
                                to solidify the opposition to Communism of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_Masjumi1">Masjumi</gloss> and the Socialists.</p>
                            <p>5. The Communists are numerically weak, but control about ten percent
                                of the votes in Parliament, draw strength from a small but active
                                group among Indonesia’s Chinese minority, and have gained
                                organizational control of the majority of labor and peasant
                                organizations, although the membership of these is predominantly
                                non-Communist. The Communists do not now appear strong enough to
                                take over the Government by force or by political means, but the
                                make-up of the Ali Cabinet presents them with an opportunity for
                                infiltration of key military and civilian positions.</p>
                            <p>6. The <gloss target="#t_Masjumi1">Masjumi</gloss> is numerically
                                strong and has a broad village-level organization, backed by strong
                                Moslem religious feeling. The anti-Communist Socialists have
                                considerable influence in the bureaucracy and the armed forces.
                                These anti-Communists can probably count on the support of important
                                parts of the armed forces. If general elections were held in the
                                near future to replace the present Sukarno-appointed Parliament, it
                                is probable that the <gloss target="#t_Masjumi1">Masjumi</gloss> and
                                Socialists would have the greatest strength and that the Communists
                                would suffer a relative loss of position.</p>
                            <p>7. The capacity of the United States to influence Indonesian leaders
                                for the attainment of its objectives has been limited by lack of
                                effective U.S. response on issues which the Indonesians consider
                                most important in their relations with the United States. The world
                                prices of rubber and tin, vital to Indonesia’s economy, have fallen,
                                and the United States has not supported Indonesia’s desire for
                                international stabilization of these commodities. With regard to New
                                Guinea, the United States has remained neutral and has offered no
                                support for Indonesia’s claim. Feasible U.S. courses of action thus
                                form only a small portion of the many significant factors to which
                                Indonesian leaders respond. These include the forces of nationalism,
                                anti-colonialism, and Islam. The United States must understand, and,
                                when possible, utilize these forces.</p>
                            <pb n="398" xml:id="pg_398" facs="0418"/>

                            <p>8. To prevent Indonesia from passing into the Communist orbit; to
                                persuade Indonesia that its best interests lie in greater
                                cooperation and stronger affiliations with the rest of the free
                                world; and to assist Indonesia to develop toward a stable, free
                                government with the will and ability to resist Communism from within
                                and without and to contribute to the strengthening of the free
                                world.</p>
                            <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">courses of action</hi></p>
                            <p>10. In carrying out the following courses of action, avoid the
                                appearance of interfering in Indonesian internal affairs.</p>
                            <p>11. Seek the elimination of Communist influence from the Indonesian
                                Government.</p>
                            <p>12. Use U.S. influence to encourage the holding of general elections
                                in Indonesia at the earliest possible date.</p>
                            <p>13. Constantly distinguish between the Communists, anti-Communists
                                and the non-Communists in order to isolate, discredit and weaken the
                                Communists, strengthen the anti-Communists, favorably influence and
                                avoid alienating the non-Communists.</p>
                            <p>14. Develop friendly relations with all anti-Communist and
                                non-Communist groups and leaders in order to preserve U.S. ability
                                to work with whatever elements, other than the Communists, may come
                                into power.</p>
                            <p>15. Exert influence wherever possible to bring about a common
                                recognition by key individuals of the gravity of the Communist
                                menace.</p>
                            <p>16. Utilize the forces of nationalism and of Islam in opposing
                                Communism, and avoid antagonizing the force of anti-colonialism.</p>
                            <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                            <p>18. Place special emphasis on the use of the personal influence of
                                American officials and private citizens on Indonesian leaders,
                                especially President Sukarno.</p>
                            <p>19. Show the Ali Cabinet no special favors which would tend to
                                strengthen its tenure of office; but, on the other hand, attempt to
                                avoid those actions which might alienate not only the Ali Cabinet
                                but Indonesia as a whole.</p>
                            <p>20. Explore urgently the practicable means of assisting Indonesia in
                                regard to its important economic problems, with particular attention
                                to the net advantage of helping Indonesia find markets for rubber
                                and tin, and explore the possibility of assisting the Indonesian <pb

                            <p>21. In the event that Communist influence is eliminated from the
                                Government of Indonesia, be prepared to take rapid appropriate
                                action that would tend to strengthen the position of such an
                                Indonesian Government, particularly with respect to helping
                                Indonesia find markets for tin and rubber.</p>
                            <p>22. In cooperation with the Indonesian Government, continue U.S.
                                economic and technical assistance, both loan and grant, as
                                appropriate, with special emphasis on the diversification of
                                production to decrease excessive dependence on rubber.</p>
                            <p>23. In cooperation with the Indonesian Government, assist in creating
                                an adequate climate for foreign investment in Indonesia.</p>
                            <p>24. Encourage, to the extent feasible, increased trade between
                                Indonesia and Japan.</p>
                            <p>25. While for the present maintaining neutrality in the New Guinea
                                dispute in our relations with other governments, explore within the
                                U.S. Government solutions to this problem compatible with overall
                                U.S. objectives, for possible discussion with other interested
                                governments.</p>
                            <p>26. As requested by the Indonesian Government, and as appropriate,
                                make available U.S. military training, military equipment and
                                supplies for the maintenance of internal security. The United States
                                should respond as sympathetically as possible, subject to conditions
                                then prevailing, to any Indonesian request for a U.S. Military
                                mission.</p>
                            <p>27. Strengthen the U.S. information program, and the exchange of
                                persons, including potential leaders in labor, industry and other
                                fields.</p>
                            <p>28. Expand intelligence collection capabilities in order to provide

                            morning on other matter to clarify what he called “misconceptions” on
                            part of number of foreign governments and especially their diplomatic
                            representatives in Djakarta of attitude of Indonesian Government towards
                            Communism. His manner was earnest and frank although I could detect a
                            certain defensiveness on his part which showed itself in a repetition of
                            a number of statements as if he were most anxious that I believe what he
                            said.</p>
                        <p>He commenced by saying that while some Moslems could for reasons unknown
                            to him reconcile their religious faith with the anti-God dogma of
                            Communists, he himself was unable to do so; he wanted me to know that
                            although he might not at all times be as devout a Moslem as he should
                            be, his faith in God was complete and a guarantee against any personal
                            leaning on his part toward Communism.</p>
                        <p>He said it was true that government was willing accept Communist Party
                            support in Parliament: “No parliamentarian could refuse to accept a vote
                            from any source;” but that government had sufficient votes to carry its
                            measure without addition of Communist votes (note discrepancy between

                                    association with Commies might be summarized: ‘We are not
                                    Communists but they have the votes we need.’ I think he realizes
                                    he playing with fire; whether all of his associates are as
                                    sophisticated is doubtful.” (756D.13/11–253)</p></note></p>

                                informed the Embassy of talks in August 1952 between Indonesian and

                                Communist terrorism. It also referred to a statement made in April
                                1953 by Sunario concerning Indonesia’s interest in political
                                developments, including the increasing strength of the Communist
                                movement, in Malaya. (Telegram 443; 756D.00/11–2453)</note></p>
                        <p>Sunario said government was also concerned with Chinese problem; Chinese
                            even though long resident in Indonesia and in former Dutch East Indies
                            had never been truly loyal to local government. He said that while
                            government especially concerned with Communist infiltration and trying
                            formulate plans to meet this situation, its principal concern was not
                            with whether Chinese were Communists or Nationalists, but whether they
                            were subversive of government of the country in which they resided.</p>
                        <p>With regard to Indochina he said that Indonesian Government had naturally
                            disliked French colonialism and French “delays” in promising real
                            independence to Associated States but that his government equally
                            understood French and Associated States were fighting Communism; that if
                            Communists were successful in Indochina, Malaya would be next and
                            “Indonesia soon after.”</p>

                                Indonesian Communist movement. The speech was characterized as the
                                President’s most forthright anti-Communist statement in some time
                                and his first since the Ali government came into office.

                            put to him by saying that the President’s reference to “extreme
                            Communists” meant Communists who were actively attempting overthrow
                            government as contrasted with rank and file of party followers. He
                            reverted to government evidence of Dutch support of Darul Islam and
                            criticized his fellow Moslems of the <gloss target="#t_Masjumi1"

                            extremist position of the Darul Islam. “The Government”, he said, “will
                            prevent any extremists taking over under an Indonesian Mossadeq.”</p>

                            necessary for the Council to determine whether the United States was
                            under obligation, in its three-year contract with the Indonesian
                            Government, to make a fair offer for some 18 to 20 thousand tons of tin,
                            the amount projected for the third and last year of the contract. The
                            period of negotiation between the <gloss target="#t_RFC1">RFC</gloss>

                            National Security Council indicating its view that the obligations of
                            the United States under the existing tin contracts require that the
                                <gloss target="#t_RFC1">RFC</gloss> make a reasonable offer to the
                            Indonesian Government in order to reach agreement on a mutually
                            satisfactory price for delivery in the third year of the contract.
                            Accordingly, <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> had suggested the
                            insertion of a new paragraph 20–a in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            171/1 to read as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Recognize the obligation of the U.S. Government by making a
                                    reasonable offer to Indonesia with the intent of reaching

                                    third year of the existing contracts. In reaching such agreement
                                    recognize the likelihood of resale and assure to the U.S. a
                                    reasonable opportunity to avoid loss on resale, at the same time
                                    assure to Indonesia that disposal will be handled in such a
                                    manner as to avoid undue disturbance to world markets.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Secretary Humphrey said that he certainly did not know, nor did he
                            believe anyone else knew, how any resale plan could be worked out to
                            achieve both of the objectives of the <gloss target="#t_OCB1"
                                >OCB</gloss> paragraph.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Smith<note n="5" xml:id="d257fn5">Under Secretary Walter B.
                                Smith was Chairman of the Operations Coordinating Board.</note>
                            commented that when he first read the proposed new paragraph it seemed
                            to him so optimistic as to be laughable, but the experts had all assured
                            him that it was possible to resell the tin in such a way as to injure
                            neither the United States nor Indonesia. If, continued Secretary Smith,
                            this proposal was OK with Secretary Humphrey, it was OK with him.</p>
                        <p>The President reminded the Council of the conviction he had expressed
                            often in the past, that a nation is not poor when it owns “things”; that
                            there were a number of metals and other materials that this country
                            would need over the years and which it should <pb n="405"
                                xml:id="pg_405" facs="0425"/>buy when good opportunity presented
                            over this same period of years.</p>
                        <p>The President replied that the point to him seemed to be whether we could
                            get this Indonesian tin at a reasonable price. Secretary Humphrey said
                            that we did not yet know the answer to the President’s question, but
                            that in any case we may have to recommend an increase in the stockpile
                            requirements for this metal.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Humphrey repeated his statement that the Council was not really
                            in a position to discuss this problem at the present time. People were
                            trying at the moment to work out a tin cartel for the whole world, and
                            no one could predict what would come of the effort. We were, however,
                            confronting certain hard and simple facts. This country now has on hand
                            a five-year supply of tin, close to 60,000 tons.<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d257fn6">On this point, the language of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> memorandum reads as follows:
                                “Present stocks, plus expected deliveries within the next few
                                months, exceed the stockpile objective by about 40,000 tons. The
                                stockpile objective is 245,000 tons. Total U.S. consumption of tin
                                is approximately 60,000 tons per year.”</note> Something more than
                            another year’s supply is now coming up. We obviously had more tin than
                            we could hope to use.</p>
                        <p>After the President had once again repeated his view on the value of the
                            stockpile, Mr. Flemming pointed out that the issue raised by Indonesian
                            tin was simply part of a much more basic and ramified problem. It seemed
                            to him that the Council must make a decision whether or not to take an
                            over-run of certain materials and put them in the stockpile.</p>
                        <p>The President again argued for stockpiling as a measure of prudence, and
                            while Secretary Humphrey said that he could understand the President’s
                            argument, we could not afford to overlook the fact that our own lead and
                            zinc miners in this country were in “tough shape”. This made it awkward
                            to envisage foreign purchases of these metals. Secretary Humphrey also
                            stated that he was heartily in favor of trading American butter for
                            Soviet manganese.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Smith reminded the Council that whatever its members thought of
                            Mr. Flemming’s suggestion for a study of basic stockpile problems, the
                            deadline for meeting our obligations to Indonesia with respect to the
                            tin was February 1, and that action was accordingly required at this
                            meeting.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Humphrey admitted that, thanks to the conduct of the <gloss

                                Symington<note n="7" xml:id="d257fn7">W. Stuart Symington, former
                                Chairman of the National Security Resources Board.</note> had got
                            himself hooked, so that we were now morally obligated to make a fair
                            offer to Indonesia for the tin to be purchased in the third year of the
                            contract. Great difficulty, he predicted, would be encountered <pb
                                n="406" xml:id="pg_406" facs="0426"/>by the United States when it
                            tried to resell the tin in a fashion which would not bust the world
                            market for tin and do irreparable damage to the Indonesian tin
                            market.</p>
                        <p>Governor Stassen agreed that the important sentence in the proposed
                                <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> paragraph was the first
                            sentence, requiring a reasonable offer to Indonesia for the purchase of
                            the tin. He believed that the Council should accept the course of action
                            outlined in this sentence. We could not afford to let Indonesia go down
                            the drain.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Smith replied that the only urgency was in the matter of our
                            purchase of the Indonesian tin. We could take our time in determining
                            how to get rid of it by resale in ways which would not be damaging to
                            the world market.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Cutler suggested that Council action take the form of accepting the
                            first sentence in the new paragraph proposed by <gloss target="#t_OCB1"
                                >OCB</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Flemming expressed agreement with this proposal, but emphasized his
                            view that we need a new policy to deal with the issues raised by
                            Indonesian tin but involving basic policy to cover resale and over-runs
                            of a variety of stockpile items.</p>
                        <p>After further discussion, the President said that in his view the
                            decision should be to make a fair offer to the Indonesian Government for
                            the purchase of the tin, prior to February 1. We could purchase this tin
                            not with a view to resale but to hold the tin until such time as it
                            could be disposed of without unduly disrupting the tin market.
                            Furthermore, said the President, it should be made absolutely clear that
                            the offer to the Indonesian Government was for a single year.</p>

                        <p>828. Limited distribution. During Vice President Nixon’s visit to
                            Indonesia last October he and I discussed the possibility of inviting
                            President Sukarno to the US at a propitious time. I have kept this
                            matter in mind and have now formed the opinion that we should actively
                            consider such an invitation. In making this recommendation, the
                            following are the considerations which I believe favor such a step: <list>

                                <item>It would be appropriate to extend an invitation to the
                                    President or Vice President of Indonesia as return courtesy for
                                    Vice President Nixon’s visit here and not too much time should
                                    elapse if any advantage is to be taken of the reciprocal
                                    courtesy.</item>

                                    cultivating him at a time when he is unofficially recognized as
                                    being in opposition to elements within present government even

                                    toward the US from which it would be difficult to disassociate

                                    non-Communist attitude would ensure against actions detrimental

                                    underestimate President’s personal proclivity for limelight and
                                    public recognition. In my estimation he would be impressed by
                                    the strength of America, its progress, and would, I feel, react
                                    favorably to the reception which he would receive in US by the
                                    President, Vice President and other high officials. Sukarno has
                                    undoubted charm, dignity and the sort of appeal which would get
                                    the type of response from the American public which would in
                                    turn favorably impress him. In this critical period we must not
                                    forget the great personal prestige of the President and the
                                    extent of his personal influence at all levels in Indonesia. If
                                    such an effort at this time would be successful it might turn
                                    out to be just what was needed to tide us over this critical
                                    period until the normal course of political events and the
                                    elections provide an opportunity for political elements more
                                    favorable to US to assert themselves.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>It is my thought that should the foregoing meet with the approval in
                            principle of the Department and the President, I be given an indication
                            of the most suitable dates and authorized to explore the matter
                            informally with the Prime Minister or perhaps President Sukarno himself.
                            If the reaction is favorable we may draw some benefit therefrom; if the
                            reaction is unfavorable, we would have the basis for formulating certain
                            conclusions re trends in Indonesian policy and President Sukarno’s
                            attitude towards US.</p>

                                <p>“As nearly as can be judged here, deterioration of Indonesian
                                    political situation with increased opportunities for Communist
                                    infiltration and subversive maneuvers is being furthered by
                                    absence of definite plans for national elections. Department
                                    would hope that if firm election date announced many current
                                    tensions would be relieved and political energies would be
                                    diverted into constructive channels.” (756D.00/1–754)</p></note>
                            I confirm Department view that genuine efforts toward an eventual

                            Indonesian political situation. Both from standpoint of principle and
                            best estimates of outcome, democratic election should have open American
                            support. Following are some observations which I believe pertinent in

                                    important point is that Government is committed to program of
                                    free elections with a date to which they should be held by

                                    participation by emphasizing contribution to nationalism. Their
                                    interpretation of neutralism, which in many instances results in
                                    bald anti-Americanism, provides atmosphere very unreceptive for

                                reads: “You are authorized in your discretion convey orally to
                                Foreign or Prime Minister our surprise and concern that
                                misrepresentation facts reflecting on <gloss target="#t_UN1"

                            February 3 I took up with Prime Minister subject matter reference
                            telegram. Purpose of my call was to introduce Ambassador Donovan<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d261fn2">William J. Donovan, U.S. Ambassador in

                            Minister I also had some business to take up with him. After general
                            conversation and taking up a few matters covered in separate
                                telegram,<note n="3" xml:id="d261fn3">Not printed.</note> I said
                            that while I did not wish to give even the appearance of meddling in an
                            internal Indonesian matter, my government had been concerned over the
                            impression given by the attendance of high Indonesian Government
                            officials that the government had placed the stamp of approval on the
                            “National Peace Congress”. After listening to my summary of the facts,
                            Prime Minister showing some emotion asked why I <pb n="412"
                                xml:id="pg_412" facs="0432"/>had taken the matter up with him rather
                            than the Foreign Minister, thus implying a criticism of his government.
                            He expressed “surprise” that in the light of our previous conversations
                            I should assume his government was pro-Communist. He then launched into
                            a rather fuzzy defense Indonesian “independent policy”, including
                            reference to economic cost to Indonesia of support US embargo Red China,
                            observing that no responsible government could let situation go on
                            without doing something about it (while I may be wrong, I am inclined to
                            believe that this observation was made for purposes of the record and
                            not necessarily as a hint that Indonesia is about to breach the
                            embargo).</p>
                        <p>I said that there was no intention of attacking his government; that I
                            had taken matter up with him rather than Foreign Minister because I
                            wanted to bring to his personal attention in the most friendly and
                            informal way how official Indonesian participation in National Congress
                            gave the appearance of approval of public criticisms, based on falsities
                            of policies of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, US, and even the
                            Indonesian Government; that the only reports available to me and to my
                            government were Indonesian newspaper reports of the Congress and I hoped
                            most sincerely that the reports were erroneous and that he could say
                            something which would remove impression given by such reports. I said
                            that if he was at all embarrassed by my taking the matter up with him I
                            would be most happy, with his agreement, to take it up with the Foreign
                            Minister instead. After some further references to the fact that there
                            were no Communists in his government and that his government was not
                            pro-Communist, he said that he could tell me, informally and personally,
                            that his government did not agree with the various statements made at
                            the National Congress. I said that I was very happy to hear this and
                            asked if I might report his remarks to my government. He said that I
                            might.</p>
                        <p>I felt throughout the conversation that Ali was very much on the
                            defensive; he spoke with feeling and in a tone of controlled and hurt
                            indignation but there something of the undertone of a small boy called
                            to account for naughtiness. Much of what he said, I felt, was for the
                            benefit of Ambassador Donovan, who was present.</p>
                        <p>During the conversation I gave him on plain paper headed “record of oral
                            statement” a summary of what I had said to him, which he said he would
                            like to retain even though I offered to retrieve it if in any way it
                            would embarrass him.</p>
                        <p>I had a moment alone with Ali at the end of the conversation and
                            expressed my satisfaction that he had been able to tell me, even though
                            personally and informally, that his government had not approved of the
                            statements at the National Congress; that I felt that the friendly
                            personal relations between us demanded of me <pb n="413" xml:id="pg_413"
                                facs="0433"/>and my government that we let him know quite frankly
                            how actions which might seem innocent to him impressed friendly
                            countries abroad. When alone with him his manner was entirely friendly,
                            and he repeated that “we must get together privately whenever my duties
                            permit”.</p>
                        <p>As a footnote I wish to report that when I saw the Prime Minister
                            yesterday evening at University of Indonesia anniversary celebration, he
                            and his wife were most cordial in greeting me. I feel therefore that the
                                <hi rend="italic">démarche</hi> was useful.</p>

                                <item>That this additional recognition would probably increase his
                                    personal prestige and add to his stature in minds of Indonesian
                                    masses. In present delicate balances in Indonesia, person of
                                    President is one of greatest stabilizing influences, and I think
                                    it advantageous to us to try to increase possibility of his
                                    maintaining this hold. With respect to his relationship to party
                                    politics, we would hope that this visit might encourage him to
                                    take a more positive stand in facing Indonesian domestic
                                    Communist problem and resisting external Communist influences.
                                    Sukarno reacts to recognition, would be impressed favorably by
                                    US power, warmth, friendship, and it is entirely possible his
                                    visit and activities in US might invoke criticism of him by

                                    of view, would be very helpful as he would resent any
                                    interference with what he would consider exercise of rightful

                                <item>Sukarno would undoubtedly express his opinion on New Guinea,
                                    especially if queried by press. He is, however, considerate by
                                    nature and following his own instincts and traditional Javanese
                                    courtesy would probably not willfully embarrass his hosts. So
                                    far as rubber, tin, economic aid concerned, it would be no more
                                    difficult to discuss these subjects with him there than with
                                    Indonesians here. As long as these issues are of vital
                                    importance to Indonesia they will have some prominence in our
                                    discussions at all levels.</item>

                                <item>It difficult to see how Sukarno visit would have any effect on
                                    Indonesian elections, especially adverse ones. It would be
                                    inadvisable for Sukarno to be out of country immediately
                                    preceding, during or following elections. They now scheduled for

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I refer to my letter to you
                            dated June 23, 1953,<note n="1" xml:id="d264fn1"><ref target="#d247"
                                    >Document 247</ref>.</note> in which I asked that you make a
                            preliminary study of the feasibility, from a military standpoint, of
                            assigning a United States military mission to Indonesia. I refer further
                            to your reply of August 27, 1953,<note n="2" xml:id="d264fn2"><ref
                                    target="#d250">Document 250</ref>.</note> which indicates that
                            the assignment of such a mission would be feasible. Our interest in your
                            views at that time was based on a request from the Ambassador of
                            Indonesia that we explore the possibility of sending a military mission
                            to his country.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador subsequently returned to Indonesia where he is now head of
                            the Cabinet which took office August 1, 1953. His Cabinet is supported
                            in Parliament by Communists. Some of the Cabinet Ministers are known to
                            have pro-Communist attitudes and to have acted in a pro-Communist
                            manner. The Cabinet, however, contains no known members of the Communist
                            Party and the Government has been extremely sensitive to allegations
                            that it is Communist influenced.</p>
                        <p>One of the Cabinet members whom we consider subject to Communist
                            influence is the Minister of Defense, Iwa Kusumasumantri. He has, since
                            assuming office, (a) placed suspected Communists in the Ministry of
                            Defense; (b) recommended arming the pro-Communist volunteer group <gloss
                                target="#t_PERBEPSI1">PERBEPSI</gloss>; and (c) sought the removal
                            of non-Communist and pro-American officers from the Indonesian armed
                            forces. His policies have been opposed by the stronger group of higher
                            ranking Indonesian Army officers constituting the “professional” corps
                            which is anti-Communist. His policies favoring <gloss
                                target="#t_PERBEPSI1">PERBEPSI</gloss> are reported to have been
                            opposed also by the more responsible members of the present Cabinet
                            under the leadership of Prime Minister Ali.</p>
                        <p>Our Ambassador in Djakarta paid a routine call on the Minister of Defense
                            on February 26. Minister Iwa told him at that time that the Indonesian
                            Government has abandoned the idea of bringing any foreign military
                            mission to Indonesia to train its defense forces but that “after further
                            consultation with the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister, he might
                            wish to get in touch with him (our Ambassador) to see if American
                            instructors might be nominated by the United States for individual
                            employment.” He went on to express <pb n="416" xml:id="pg_416"
                                facs="0436"/>his satisfaction with the training that Indonesian
                            officers have received in the United States and stated his preference
                            for American training over that obtained from other countries.</p>
                        <p>While the Department does not desire to support the present Minister of
                            Defense nor endorse him in any way, the opportunity to introduce
                            American Army officers into the Indonesian Army appears worthy of study
                            and possibly, encouragement. In view of the advantages to the United
                            States which could accrue, we do not believe that an adverse evaluation
                            of Iwa or his motives should be decisive in determining the course of
                            action for the United States. We believe that an opportunity to place
                            carefully selected American Army officers in the Indonesian Army for
                            training purposes would provide a means of exerting an influence against
                            communism.…</p>
                        <p>The Department does not intend to show any eagerness in responding to the
                            Indonesian Minister of Defense but believes there would be value in
                            indicating to Prime Minister Ali and Foreign Minister Sunario that we
                            would be cooperative if the Indonesian Government formalizes its
                            position in this matter.</p>
                        <p>I would appreciate your exploring the question of whether the Department
                            of Defense could nominate United States Army officers (or reserve or
                            retired United States Army officers) if a firm request should be
                            forthcoming from the Indonesian Government. I would also appreciate
                            receiving your evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages, from a
                            military standpoint, of giving Indonesia military training assistance
                            under such an individual contract plan.</p>
                        <p>Sincerely,</p>

                                (711.56356D/4–654)</note> raises a number of difficult questions,
                            the most potent of which are the following: <list>

                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>Can Filipino officers be utilized for training in

                                <item>Can the dollar cost of the above training be borne by the

                                <item>Can the above arrangements be handled discreetly, if not
                                    secretly, with Prime Minister Ali and perhaps one or two other

                            </list></p>
                        <p>These questions raise, in turn, the important policy question: would the
                            U.S. by providing military training to the present Government strengthen
                            that Government and prolong its life (<gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> 171/1, paragraph 19)?<note n="2" xml:id="d265fn2">
                                <ref target="#d255">Document 255</ref>.</note> Almost equally
                            important is the question: would the U.S. in providing military
                            instructors through secret negotiations with the Prime Minister, risk
                            precipitating another Cabinet crisis, which like the “<gloss
                                target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> crisis” of February 1952, would create
                            a “setback” to U.S.-Indonesian relations and contribute to the
                            establishment of a cabinet less amenable to cooperation with the U.S.?
                            It is not impossible that Iwa, acting on instructions from the Communist
                            Party, is setting a trap for the U.S. and for the Indonesian
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>I believe we can and should continue to explore this subject with the
                            present Government. I believe the most desirable initial step would be
                            the assignment at the Indonesian Government’s request of a qualified
                            officer whose principal initial task would be to establish contacts with
                            Indonesian Army leadership, survey the situation and draw up
                            recommendations for training (he would best be under individual contract
                            to the Indonesian Government). We should also explore on a confidential
                            basis with the Philippine Government an arrangement under which
                            qualified Philippine officers could be provided Indonesia on contract or
                            loan. If the officer assigned to make the initial survey were successful
                            in his contacts, and if his recommendations warranted it, a request by
                            the Indonesian Government should be stimulated to which the U.S. could
                            respond favorably. Such a request should have: <list>

                        <p>Such a development would warrant a request for <gloss target="#t_OCB1"

                        <p>The President, the Secretary, and certain officers of the Department have
                            been approached to grant interviews to Karel J.V. Nikijuluw on behalf of
                            the “Republic of the South Moluccas”. Lawrence Griswold, an American
                            free-lance writer, has acted as intermediary on occasion. Their request

                            to see the Secretary was also turned down.</p>
                        <p>The “Republic of the South Moluccas” is an insurgent group which led an
                            unsuccessful revolt on the island of Ambon against the Republic of
                            Indonesia in 1950. It has continued through correspondence and
                            publications to seek support for the alleged Republic. The Department
                            has refused to answer correspondence from persons identifiable with it.
                            The Indonesian Embassy has on several occasions protested over
                            Nikijuluw’s presence and activities in the United States. It has
                            asserted that he and the group he represents menace the security of
                            Indonesia by smuggling arms and persons into the islands of eastern
                            Indonesia via Netherlands New Guinea.</p>
                        <p>The Department has no evidence which would positively identify Nikijuluw
                            or the “Republic of the South Moluccas” with the actions which Indonesia
                            alleges. However, as the group is an insurgent one inimical to the
                            interests of the Republic of Indonesia, I have recommended against
                            granting interviews to Nikijuluw or other persons identifiable with the
                            “Republic of the South Moluccas” since to do so might embarrass
                            U.S.-Indonesian relations and seriously hinder the achievement of our
                            objectives with respect to that country.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The Department’s referenced telegram requests the Embassy’s comment on
                            the estimate made by Foreign Minister Luns to Ambassador Matthews on the
                            situation in Indonesia. Minister Luns expressed grave concern over the
                            general deterioration which he felt was taking place in Indonesia.…</p>
                        <pb n="420" xml:id="pg_420" facs="0440"/>
                        <p>There has unquestionably been a progressive deterioration of the
                            Indonesian political and economic situation during the past 18 months
                            and it is not impossible that this deterioration may continue
                            uninterrupted during the months to come.…</p>
                        <p>There can be no questioning of Minister Luns’ basic contention that the
                            last two years have seen a progressive deterioration in the economic and
                            political situation in Indonesia. Certain aspects of this
                            disintegration, however, could not be considered as entirely unexpected.
                            With the waning in force of the central unifying centripetal element in
                            Indonesian political life, the common struggle for independence, it
                            would seem logical to anticipate in a country such as Indonesia, with
                            great land and sea distances, poor communications, with a politically
                            immature population of widely different ethnic and cultural backgrounds,
                            that domestic political fragmentation and struggle for power, together
                            with a general development and strengthening of the centrifugal forces
                            inherent in the social and political structure of the Indonesia nation,
                            would take place. Whatever the validity of this thesis, it is true that
                            in the past two years Indonesia’s basic economic, demographic, and
                            political problems have been augmented by a growth in provincial
                            dissatisfaction with the central government, by a deteriorating internal
                            security situation, by increasingly bitter inter-party political
                            conflict, and by a resurgence and return to a position of influence of
                            the Indonesian Communist Party. Even this incomplete enumeration of
                            certain current and obvious evidences of disintegration and
                            deterioration provide, apparently, more than adequate grounds for a
                            pessimistic estimate of Indonesia’s immediate future.</p>
                        <p>There are, however, certain basic aspects of the Indonesian situation
                            which tend to relieve an otherwise almost uniformly gloomy picture and
                            perhaps even provide grounds for some reserved optimism.</p>
                        <p>The very conditions which have impeded the development of an integrated,
                            unified state from a nation extending over hundreds of miles of islands
                            and seas—poor communications, divergent cultural ethnic groups—have also
                            tended to soften and delay the impact in one section of Indonesia, of
                            disturbances and disruptions in other sections of the country. This
                            looseness of its political and economic organization has given Indonesia
                            a flexibility and resilience to shocks which would completely disrupt a
                            tightly knit, integrated, geographically unitary state. In a sense,
                            therefore, almost all developments in Indonesia are “local”
                            developments.</p>
                        <p>The fact that the vast majority of Indonesian people are engaged in
                            subsistence agriculture has also contributed to the above mentioned
                            basic flexibility, resilience and stability of the Indonesian <pb
                                n="421" xml:id="pg_421" facs="0441"/>social and economic structure.
                            (In gang-ravaged West Java, rice production in 1953 was greater than in
                            1952.)</p>
                        <p>The disillusionment, cynicism, and bitter conflicts characteristic of the
                            political atmosphere in Djakarta are much less evident outside the
                            capital city.</p>
                        <p>Although imperfectly understood, there is among the small educated group
                            ruling Indonesia today a deep respect and emotional attachment to
                            Western concepts of democratic liberalism. This Dutch cultural heritage
                            is reflected in Indonesian political life, among other ways, by a
                            general acceptance of parliamentary procedures as the proper system of
                            government for Indonesia, by a belief that a free exchange of ideas is
                            necessary for a healthy democracy, and by an almost overly tolerant
                            attitude towards divergent political ideologies. An immature,
                            ill-informed, fractious, but independent press, conscious of its role in
                            a democratic society, exists. With the exception of the Indonesian
                            Communist Party and the outlawed <gloss target="#t_DI1">DI</gloss>, no
                            Indonesian political party could be justly accused of aspiring to
                            dictatorial powers.</p>
                        <p>The person of Sukarno, and the office of the presidency, provide a
                            significant element of continuity and stability, and constitute a
                            unifying force of considerable importance. Sukarno shares with other
                            Indonesian non-Communist leaders the above mentioned respect for
                            democratic institutions and practices, and he has lent both by his
                            actions and words the weight of his considerable influence to their
                            support. It is impossible to predict how Sukarno will use his power in
                            the future, but at present he appears to be sincerely and
                            self-consciously dedicated to the task of guiding the development of
                            “his” nation along democratic and constitutional paths—as he understands
                            these concepts.</p>
                        <p>Although the Indonesian Communist Party is in a stronger position today
                            than at any time since immediately prior to the Madiun uprising, it is
                            not at present in a position to make a successful bid for power. Many of
                            Indonesia’s present leaders continue to show a disquieting tolerance of
                            Communist organizational activity, a naive confidence that the PKI can
                            be used with impunity to further their own political ends, and a
                            stubborn reluctance to abandon the idea that Communism is somehow
                            “liberal” and “progressive”. Nevertheless, with the PKI resurgence have
                            come encouraging signs that the lesson of Madiun may not have been
                            forgotten and that even those presently cooperating with the PKI may be
                            beginning to doubt the Communist’s claims that they are a nationalist
                            political party free of Moscow or Peking control.</p>
                        <p>Indonesia has no common boundary with a country under Communist
                            control.</p>
                        <pb n="422" xml:id="pg_422" facs="0442"/>
                        <p>The Indonesian national police constitutes a well-organized, generally
                            well-led, and non-political law enforcement body which has demonstrated
                            by its actions the realistic and pragmatic attitude that the Communists
                            represent a threat to law and order. The Indonesian Army, while split by
                            internal difference, and subject to constant political pressures, has
                            remained successfully, essentially non-political, and its top
                            leadership, with few exceptions, has shown itself loyal to the concept
                            of the Army as the servant and defender of the state.</p>
                        <p>In listing some of the elements in the current Indonesian situation which
                            are considered to exercise a stabilizing influence or to ameliorate
                            disruptive influences it is not the Embassy’s intention to minimize the
                            seriousness of the Indonesian situation as it exists today. A Communist
                            victory in Indochina and an expansion of Communist control into the
                            Malayan Peninsula; a successful Communist infiltration of the Army and
                            the police or the development of a para military force under Communist
                            control; the emergence into open violence, clearly under the surface, of
                            present day Indonesian political antagonisms; the death of Sukarno;
                            could produce, singly or in combination, a rapid and extremely grave
                            deterioration in the local situation. It is felt, however, that the
                            situation as it exists today does not justify an estimate as pessimistic
                            as that expressed by Minister Luns, and that certain basic stabilizing
                            forces may be strong enough to maintain a viable Indonesian Government
                            for some time to come.</p>

                            February 27. At Dutch National Day party yesterday, Pringodigdo, Chief
                            President Sukarno’s Secretariat, drew me to one side. He apologized for
                            doing so but said he wanted to talk to me before leaving Monday<note
                                n="1" xml:id="d269fn1">May 3.</note> with President on a trip to
                            Lesser Sundas and Amboin. Pringo said that some time ago Sukarno had
                            discussed with Ambassador Cochran the possibility of a visit to US;
                            Sukarno had wanted to go and Ambassador Cochran thought arrangements
                            could be worked out; trip however had not materialized because of
                            attitude of the then Indonesian Government. Pringo said he thought time
                            now ripe again to consider such a visit; that he had not discussed
                            question with President (I doubt this) or Prime Minister but he knew
                            that Foreign Minister and “some other Cabinet officer” would like to
                            have Sukarno visit US: Sunario particularly anxious to accompany
                            President himself. He repeatedly emphasized that he was not putting the
                            idea to me officially but would be grateful if I could give him my
                            personal opinion as to possibility of such a visit. In reply to my
                            question he said he thought visit might not be practicable until some
                            time in late winter or early spring of 1955—perhaps a little later but
                            in any case should take place before the election, which he believed
                            would not come before June or perhaps July 1955 (this coincides with
                            statement made to me Friday by <gloss target="#t_Masjumi1"
                                >Masjumi</gloss> leader Natsir). I remarked that that was a long
                            time off; that much could happen in Indonesia, in US and in world in the
                            next twelve months and suggested therefore that even though foreign
                            visits of chiefs of state required much prior planning Pringo’s question
                            might perhaps be premature. Pringo replied that President was leaning
                            more and more towards US, partly because of real liking for Americans
                            and <pb n="425" xml:id="pg_425" facs="0445"/>American ways and partly
                            because of distrust of PKI activities. Pringo hastily added that
                            President’s “leaning” did not mean abandonment Indonesian independent
                            policy. I asked him why he thought visit should take place before
                            Indonesian elections. He said that “no matter what happened” <gloss
                                target="#t_Masjumi1">Masjumi</gloss>, who were the “most
                            pro-American” of all Indonesian political parties, would win the
                            elections; that he saw an advantage to US in having <gloss
                                target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss>, who after elections would be principal
                            opposition party, gain credit for accomplishing Sukarno’s visit to US.
                            He thought this would not adversely influence pro-US attitude of <gloss
                                target="#t_Masjumi1">Masjumi</gloss> and intimated vaguely they
                            might be consulted privately at proper time.</p>
                        <p>Pringo went on to say that he thought time was approaching when I should
                            have a private conversation with President Sukarno to ascertain for
                            myself general trend of his current views on world situation and
                            Indonesian role therein. He suggested that he and I meet after his
                            return three weeks or so hence from his trip with the President and
                            expressed hope that at that time I might be able to give him my personal
                            views re Sukarno visit US. He said at that time we could also work out
                            arrangements for me to see President privately, perhaps giving as an
                            excuse presentation of some book to avoid undue public speculation over
                            reason for American Ambassador having audience with President.</p>
                        <p>I told Pringo that I would reflect on our conversation and would try to
                            develop some personal views to give him on his return.</p>
                        <p>As stated above, I doubt very much whether Pringo made this approach to
                            me without foreknowledge of President, especially as its presentation
                            seemed so thoroughly worked out. I venture to remind Department that
                            Pringo has reputation being something of an intriguer—and I am wary of
                            any effort to draw me into present confused currents of Indonesian
                            politics unless I can be reasonably certain of the purpose and of the
                            outcome from standpoint US objectives. I would welcome any guidance
                            Department might wish to give me prior to my next talk with Pringo and
                            as to attitude I should take with respect to Pringo’s suggestion that I
                            should see the President. Subject to world and local developments next
                            few weeks I am presently of opinion that it might be useful to have as
                            thorough a talk with President as circumstances permitted even though he
                            is certain to raise Irian.</p>

                            long-standing desire visit U.S. could, if properly developed, a) be

                                <p>“At President’s birthday reception Sunday [June 6] Sukarno told
                                    me he had instructed Pringgodigdo arrange for audience with me
                                    on June 14. Of passing interest is fact President engaged me in
                                    friendly conversation for longer period than any other chief of
                                    mission present including Red Chinese. Nothing of importance was
                                    said, but incident was commented on by colleagues.” (123
                                    Cumming, Hugh S., Jr.)</p></note> Pringgodigdo lunched with me
                            yesterday. He confirmed impression I gained in conversation with
                            President last Sunday that Sukarno welcomed opportunity for private talk
                            with me. Pringgodigdo said that he wanted to warn me however that,
                            having consulted with some of his other advisers, President was now of
                            opinion that he neither could nor should visit the US until after the
                            elections and then only if “the election showed a good result”.</p>
                        <p>He said that any presidential trips abroad in the meantime would probably
                            have to be confined to Asian countries and he hinted that a suggestion
                            had recently come from Pakistan that the President visit that country,
                            such a visit would have to include India and perhaps Ceylon.</p>
                        <p>Replying to my question as to meaning of “a good result”, Pringgodigdo
                            said that the President, who has been progressively isolating himself
                            from nearly all political leaders and factions except <pb n="428"
                                xml:id="pg_428" facs="0448"/><gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> and
                            leftist groups associated with <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss>, was
                            convinced that there was very little chance of <gloss
                                target="#t_Masjumi1">Masjumi</gloss> supporting him personally under
                            any circumstances; that “good result” therefore meant, speaking broadly,
                            a <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> victory; that, in other words, the
                            President felt that <gloss target="#t_Masjumi1">Masjumi</gloss>, if they
                            came into power singlehandedly or with support of <gloss
                                target="#t_PSI1">PSI</gloss>, would oppose him in the presidential
                            elections scheduled to follow the adoption of the new constitution.
                            Pringgodigdo said that the President had now so closely identified
                            himself with the <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> that it was
                            impossible for him to visualize his own continuance in office without a
                                <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> victory. He said that the
                            President also related his continuance in office to the success of
                            democracy in Indonesia “as the President now conceives democracy”. He
                            did not elucidate. The <gloss target="#t_Masjumi1">Masjumi</gloss> have
                            greatly strengthened and extended their party organization in the rural
                            areas and this in turn had within the past few weeks led the President
                            to condone and even encourage the “brutality” with which <gloss
                                target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> were removing officials of all grades
                            from office and supplementing them with their own people. Pringgodigdo
                            felt that practically the only person in <gloss target="#t_PNI1"
                                >PNI</gloss> who can exercise a moderating influence on the
                            President is Abdul Gani who he said the President had personally ordered
                            appointed Secretary General of the Foreign Office. He thought that Abdul
                            Gani especially and perhaps a few others including Sunario (despite the
                            latter’s close association with Prime Minister Ali) might under
                            favorable conditions be able to participate in a working agreement
                            between <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> and the moderate <gloss
                                target="#t_Masjumi1">Masjumi</gloss>, but he added “at the present
                            time I see little likelihood of such an arrangement being brought about.
                            The President and his <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> advisers are
                            determined upon a <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> victory without
                            seeking <gloss target="#t_Masjumi1">Masjumi</gloss> collaboration”.</p>
                        <p>Reverting to his use of the word “brutality” in connection with <gloss
                                target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> removal of opponents from office, he
                            said that <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> preparations for the
                            elections were very thorough and far reaching. He had heard the estimate
                            made by a <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> leader in an unguarded
                            moment that through control of the electoral and administrative
                            machinery they could keep the vote down to 30 percent of the qualified
                            electoral lists (my note: these are not yet drawn up) and, if so, could
                            win the elections. He said that perhaps I was aware that the <gloss
                                target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> “preparations” included the
                            solicitation under pressure of funds from not only the Chinese element
                            of the Indonesian population but also from foreign firms (see <gloss

                                >This message, dated May 25, reported at some length on two recently
                                discernible trends in the economic scene: First, an increase in
                                pressure on American and other foreign firms for “Indonesianization”
                                of their operations at an accelerated and “unreasonable” rate;
                                second, “the increasing evidence of political graft, partly for
                                individual enrichment but mainly as a means of filling party
                                election campaign chests.” (811.05156D/5–2554)</note> I said that
                                <pb n="429" xml:id="pg_429" facs="0449"/>I had heard such rumors and
                            that I was fully determined to do every proper thing within my power to
                            protect any American interests from compulsory contribution to any
                            political party in Indonesia. (Quite frankly I said that with emphasis
                            in the hope that Pringgodigdo might repeat my remarks to the proper
                            quarters.) Pringgodigdo shrugged his shoulders and said he could
                            understand my point of view but perhaps the only result of any such
                            action would be obtaining of advantages by British and Dutch firms at
                            the expense of the American firms. I dropped the subject.</p>
                        <p>Pringgodigdo also asked me if I was aware of the assistance the US was
                            giving <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> through technical assistance
                            in improving the facilities of the RRI (state radio). I said I had not
                            thought of technical assistance in that light but that I had wondered a
                            little at the government statement sometime ago that the state radio
                            system could not be used for criticism of the government even to the
                            point of forbidding the reading over the radio of published newspaper
                            articles critical of governmental policy. Pringgodigdo observed that
                            this was only one of a number of measures adopted at one of the first
                            meetings of the present cabinet to exercise restraint over public
                            opinion to the advantage of <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> and its
                            supporters. (For Department’s information, the acting director of <gloss
                                target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> mission and I had already agreed upon
                            the preparation of a telegram recommending a reduction insofar as
                            legally possible in the funds allocated for improvement of the Djakarta
                            broadcasting station.)</p>
                        <p>Pringgodigdo said that in his opinion Vice President Hatta was the only
                            political personage in Indonesia who could in the long run pull the
                            country together unless, of course, Sukarno should himself resume direct
                            personal contacts with leaders of the several non-and anti-Communist
                            parties, and this latter possibility he thought unlikely since Sukarno
                            more and more tended to rely upon his personal prestige with the body of
                            the Indonesian people. He said, however, that it was now over a year
                            since Hatta had had a real talk with the President and that Hatta
                            himself felt that the breach between the two was probably irreparable,
                            although Hatta’s loyalty was such that it was unlikely he would take the
                            initiative in any move against the President. He went on to say that
                            whereas up to 18 months or two years ago the President in private
                            conversation was outspoken against the Communists, he now tended in
                            private circles to be more moderate in his criticisms and went out of
                            his way to receive fellow travellers from abroad. (This is true.) He
                            hastened to say that this did not mean that the President had become
                            pro-Communist but only that the Communists, by exercising restraint <pb
                                n="430" xml:id="pg_430" facs="0450"/>and refraining from personal
                            attacks on Sukarno and diverting such attacks to Hatta, had “somewhat
                            weakened the President’s mental defenses against the Communist
                            infiltrators” as distinguished from what the President had described as
                            “the extremist Communists” deriving direct support from abroad. He added
                            that the principal support of democracy in Indonesia aside from Hatta
                            “was now the Siliwangi division” and that it was the patriotism of such
                            military leaders as Colonels Simbolon, Kawilarang and Bachrun which
                            provided such balance as presently exists in Indonesia.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> I think Department will agree that, even
                            granting Pringgodigdo’s gossipy nature, the foregoing is an
                            extraordinary conversation considering Pringgodigdo’s position as chief
                            of the presidential secretariat. Conversation gives nothing especially
                            new but does confirm … other sources and isolated conversations which
                            members of my staff have had with their contacts. Not knowing exactly
                            why Pringgodigdo should unbosom himself so freely to me, I exercised
                            greatest possible restraint in my share of conversation and except as
                            indicated in the body of this telegram, made no comment except such as
                            were necessary to draw Pringgodigdo out further and also the following:
                            At one point I asked Pringgodigdo whether he realized that what he was
                            telling me of the President’s personality, character and present
                            political orientation was of the greatest importance in the light of his
                            leadership of a key country in <gloss target="#t_SE1">SE</gloss> Asia
                            during this critical period. I did this partly to give him an
                            opportunity to reconsider his remarks if he so chose. He seemed to
                            understand fully, agreed with me and expressed his own concern and those
                            of his friends (whom he did not identify) over (1) the manner in which
                            PKI had gotten behind the guard of many Indonesian leaders, (2)
                            possibility of some agreement at Geneva which would end up by opening
                            way to Communist control of all Indochina, (3) immediate danger this
                            would pose to Indonesia, (4) tendency of some <gloss target="#t_PNI1"

                        <p>1495. Limit distribution. During my conversation with President Sukarno
                            yesterday morning I mentioned subject of his visiting the US. I told him
                            that I could make no commitments and assumed that he could not either
                            but that I was certain my government would approve of my following up my
                            conversation with Pringgodigdo (<gloss target="#t_mytel1">mytel</gloss>

                            way. I said that the subject would require very careful personal
                            planning between us so that if at the last minute the visit should prove
                            to be unwise from either the American or <gloss target="#t_Indo1"
                                >Indo</gloss> standpoint, the trip could be dropped or deferred
                            without embarrassment to either side. He said he was aware of my
                            conversation with Pringgo and that he was sincerely grateful for the
                            interest I had displayed in his visiting the US; that even though he
                            might not approve of all US policies, he had the deepest admiration for
                            America and for its leadership of and inspiration to all those who
                            believed in real freedom. He said he wished to visit the US more than
                            any other country in the world but that he could not make definite plans
                            at this time because of two major considerations, first, the <gloss
                                target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> elections which were of vital
                            importance to the future of country and of immediate concern “to my own
                            future” and, secondly, the Afro-Asian conference, planning for which was
                            engaging his attention. (I tried to draw him out on the latter point but
                            he confined himself to saying that such a conference was in his opinion
                            extremely important to building up understanding between “the peoples
                            concerned”.) He said that these considerations made a visit perhaps
                            impossible until some time in early 1955 but in meantime he suggested we
                            keep the subject open between the two of us, with either free to raise
                            the question at any time.</p>

                        <p>1496. Limit distribution. At meeting with President Sukarno this morning
                            I presented him with set of Lincoln’s works and a film of President
                            Eisenhower’s TV speech of April 5,<note n="1" xml:id="d273fn1">Radio and

                            President was greatly pleased.</p>
                        <p>Remainder of conversation, which lasted over forty-five minutes, revolved
                            around Irian. Irian was the warp and other topics as they arose the woof
                            of the pattern of impressions which Sukarno almost too obviously wished
                            to leave in my mind.</p>
                        <p>After exchange of amenities, during which President said he was glad to
                            have a private conversation with me and hoped that I would permit him to
                            be as frank as he wished me to be, he asked me for my views on “the
                            politics of the day” and added “by politics I mean your views on Irian”.
                            I said that I had heard the <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>
                            position expressed by a number of people but would appreciate hearing
                            first hand from him his own views. He very briefly summarized his well
                            known statements of the past laying special emphasis on the failure of
                            the Dutch in the past even to discuss the problem. He spoke very quietly
                            and without histrionics, and the whole conversation continued in that
                            tone. I elaborated on the points I made to Sunario as reported my
                            telegram 1153,<note n="2" xml:id="d273fn2">See <ref target="#d270fn4"
                                    >footnote 4, Document 270</ref>.</note> emphasizing the
                            potential greatness of <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>s future;
                            the part he could play in making <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>
                            influence a force for good and for stability in Southeast Asia and in
                            Asia as a whole; and our hope that even though our two countries might
                            not see eye to eye on every issue we might develop a close and lasting
                            relationship. I stressed our historic aversion to colonialism in all its
                            forms and the steps we had taken in recent years to give expression to
                            our attitude, such as Philippine independence and more especially the
                            untiring efforts of Secretary Dulles to bring about real independence
                            for the Associated States in Indochina. I called attention, on the other
                            hand, to our world-wide interests and commitments such as <gloss
                                target="#t_ANZUS1">ANZUS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>, the latter including our wartime and present day
                            ally, The Netherlands. I suggested to him my personal view that
                            colonialism except as practiced <pb n="433" xml:id="pg_433" facs="0453"
                            />by Soviet Union would inevitably wither away but that such momentous
                            changes in the historic pattern of world relationships developed over
                            the past two or three centuries could not take place overnight. I
                            concluded by asking him to appreciate the reason for our neutrality in
                            Irian matter, caught as we might otherwise be in a dispute between our
                            good friend Indonesia on the one hand and our close ally The Netherlands
                            on the other.</p>
                        <p>Sukarno listened very intently and remarked that I had made a very
                            appealing exposition of US views which he could understand but could not
                            agree with. He said he thought we were making a great mistake in linking
                            our European interests with our Asian interests; that “his people”, who
                            were inexperienced in world affairs, could only see that the US would
                            not support their desire to “reincorporate Irian in the <gloss
                                target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> State” and that this was equivalent
                            to support of the Dutch position; that on the other hand they heard
                            constantly repeated Soviet and Communist Chinese support of <gloss
                                target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> claims and this tended, despite our
                            record as anti-colonialist, to make <gloss target="#t_Indo1"
                                >Indo</gloss> people feel that the important aspect of American
                            policy was not so much anti-communism as anti-Asian (<hi rend="italic"
                                >sic</hi>).</p>
                        <p>I replied that I did not think our position on Irian involved the linking
                            of European and Asian considerations but rather the difficult and trying
                            task of reconciling sometimes divergent interests and obligations in
                            widely separated parts of the world. I used the well worn figure of the
                            ripples caused by a stone thrown into a pond.</p>
                        <p>I said that as an American I felt confident that despite mistakes we had
                            made from time to time, in the long run the peoples of Asia would come
                            to understand our real sympathy with their true aims and aspirations and
                            appreciate the many things we had done to help them attain and protect
                            their independence. To this Sukarno replied that we should not forget
                            that the peoples of Asia were rapidly developing their own points of
                            view and that if we delayed too long settling such problems as Irian
                            along the lines of Asian wishes we might find that Soviet propaganda had
                            penetrated and won over the hearts of Asian people. (At this first
                            interview with Sukarno I did not think any useful purpose would be
                            served by questioning too openly his identification of the desires of
                            the <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> people—which really means
                            Sukarno’s personal aims—with the aspirations of the Asian people who in
                            my opinion know little and care less about the future of Irian.)</p>
                        <p>Sukarno said he did not understand why we did not intervene in Irian
                            question when we had already intervened in Korea and in Indochina. I
                            tried to make clear to him the difference between our participation in
                            Korea as a member of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, our
                            “intervention” in Indochina and the Irian dispute. This gave me an

                        <p>The meeting broke up in a very friendly spirit and the President said he
                            would be glad to talk with me again at any time. He was good enough to
                            say that he appreciated my frankness and friendly manner. When I left

                            only natural that given Sukarno’s absorption with Irian he should

                            in Indonesia and abroad that Indonesia was contemplating sale of rubber
                            to Red China. I said that I was reluctant to believe that these stories
                            were correct and suggested to him that since a Polish ship was involved
                            that perhaps rubber was in fact destined to Poland to which country
                            Indonesia rubber had been shipped for sometime past. I made the five
                            points outlined in <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 13, and
                            based my presentation on the advice given Baldwin by Mukarto (<gloss

                            Ali, who spoke very quietly and in a friendly way during the entire
                            conversation, said that he would “look into the matter” and added that
                            he assumed from my manner of presentation that in mentioning the Battle
                            Act I was not “threatening Indonesian Government”. I replied that he was
                            quite correct, but that if <pb n="438" xml:id="pg_438" facs="0458"/>the
                            press reports were true our friendly feelings towards Indonesia required
                            that we inform him as Prime Minister of the content of our domestic
                            legislation which had as its primary aim the support of the United
                            Nations, a principle to which his government as well as he personally
                            thus far had given unwavering support despite the economic cost.</p>
                        <p>There followed a 45-minute conversation which might be summarized as
                            follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>While never admitting directly that Indonesia planned to send
                                    rubber China, Ali said that he was in dilemma: On the one hand,
                                    10 million Indonesians were dependent upon exports of
                                    smallholder rubber, markets for which were difficult to find; on
                                    the other hand he was faced with adverse of American reaction
                                    and possible invocation of Battle Act plus being charged with
                                    breaching <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> embargo—with respect
                                    to latter he quoted that Indonesia had abstained in the vote on
                                    the resolution. With respect to invocation of Battle Act he said
                                    he found it difficult to believe that in weighing relative
                                    strategic importance to the US of a few small shipments of low
                                    grade rubber to China against deterioration of Indonesian-US
                                    relations we would not (a) sympathize with Indonesia’s economic
                                    and financial situation and therefore (b) exercise discretion
                                    which he said he thought was permitted by Battle Act. On the
                                    American aid question he said that our technical assistance had
                                    been much appreciated and had been helpful to Indonesia but that
                                    its volume was not sufficient for it to be missed if withdrawn.
                                    Over and over again he referred to his desire improve
                                    US–Indonesian relationships which had “deteriorated or at least
                                    lost their warmth” during past 3 and ½ years but balanced
                                    against this his duty to look after economic interests of his 10
                                    million smallholders.</p>
                                <p>I told the Prime Minister that I felt that my government also
                                    wished to maintain as warm as possible relations with Indonesia
                                    and that I was prepared at any time to transmit any suggestions
                                    to that end that he might have in mind as well as any
                                    possibilities that might be explored for assisting Indonesia
                                    within the limits imposed on us by other commitments and our own
                                    policies and by Indonesia’s wishes. He made no reply to this
                                    statement but reiterated (a) his intention “to look carefully
                                    into the matter of rubber shipments and to let me know results”,
                                    (b) his plea for understanding by the US of Indonesia’s
                                    difficult economic and financial position and (c) his hope that
                                    we would find an area for the exercise of executive discretion
                                    in application of Battle Act should some shipment take
                                    place.</p>

                            me to believe that such a transaction is in fact under consideration but
                            that he is dragging out implementation as long as possible to test US
                            reaction, to improve bargaining position during current trade and <pb

                            economic assistance by US, and at same time trying not to go so far so
                            quickly that he cannot reverse his course of action if necessary.</p>
                        <p>Regardless of the foregoing I cannot escape the conclusion that Ali is
                            fully prepared to face up to the consequences of rubber shipment to
                            China if that should be his final decision and that for some time past
                            his intentions to take such a decision has been firming. I also believe
                            that he is banking very strongly on the possibility that the US will not
                            take any retaliatory action under Battle Act because of adverse affect
                            on public opinion in Indonesia and Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>I urge that there be no publicity on the representations to Mukarto or to
                            Ali and Indonesian Government be given reasonable period for digestion.
                            I think publicity-wise the situation can best be handled by carefully
                            planned and not too obviously inspired press comment which would not
                            close door to a possible reconsideration by Ali without loss of
                            face.</p>
                        <p>If the shipment should take place and if after careful weighing of the
                            pros and cons US Government should decide to terminate aid program
                            Indonesia, I urge that this be done in such a way (if legally possible)
                            as to make quite clear that aid can and will be resumed if desired by
                            Indonesia whenever prohibited trade with Red China ceases. This will not
                            in any way mitigate the to be expected virulence of Communist and
                            Nationalist propaganda testament of our action but might give opposition

                                mention was made of the reported shipment of Indonesian rubber to
                                the People’s Republic of China. President Eisenhower observed that
                                he thought it would be a first-rate idea to have Indonesia sell its
                                low-quality rubber to Communist China and then commented that it
                                would be best for the United States to turn its “blind side” to the
                                transaction. (Eisenhower Library, Eisenhower papers, Whitman

                            <item>I fully realize dilemma posed by possible <gloss target="#t_Indo1"
                                    >Indo</gloss> rubber shipment China. Of one thing I feel
                                certain, however, and that is invocation of Battle Act, should
                                rubber in fact be shipped, will on balance obstruct the attainment
                                of our objectives Indonesia. Our primary objectives are to stem any
                                drift of Indonesian policy away from one of “independence” toward
                                the Soviet bloc, to slow down and ultimately to turn back slow
                                Communist influence within the government, and in the long run to
                                deflect <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> policy towards a
                                voluntary understanding and support of the US position in world
                                affairs. Termination of our aid program would not only, I think, be
                                used against us by the anti-American elements in Indo—and they are
                                not all <pb n="444" xml:id="pg_444" facs="0464"/>Communist—but would

                                of our barely begun program of assistance to the national police, a
                                program agreed to by Ali not without, I am sure, considerable
                                soul-searching, would alone be severe setback.</item>

                            <item>I am quite certain that Ali understands very clearly that shipment
                                of rubber to China would involve mandatory consideration such action
                                under pertinent provisions Battle Act. (Two days after my call on
                                him the Foreign Office asked Embassy for full text of all provisions
                                US law this point.) However, I was very careful in my conversation
                                with Ali not to emphasize that “mandatory consideration” necessarily
                                meant termination of aid as I wished to reserve for Department the
                                fullest freedom of action in this respect. This did not in my
                                opinion detract in any way from the earnestness of my
                                representations. I entirely agree with Department that we cannot
                                afford to bluff.</item>

                                            expressed the view that the Ali Cabinet would probably
                                            not fall in the next 6 months over the issue of the
                                            deteriorating economic situation. He also felt that the
                                            extension of direct U.S. aid would help the Ali
                                            government but, on the other hand, withholding the aid
                                            would not seriously shorten the life of the government.
                                            Furthermore, any offer of U.S. aid, while it might be
                                            accepted, would almost certainly be interpreted as an
                                            effort to buy Indonesian support and sympathy in the
                                            cold war and would probably make the Ali government less
                                            rather than more inclined to put its economic and
                                            financial house in order. (398.13/6–2454)</note></item>

                                Initially moderate voices would have to be small and hesitant and
                                could not make themselves heard unless and until Ali policies and

                            Following Jones’ arrival we have undertaken a joint re-examination of
                            the whole situation created by the prospect of Indonesian rubber sales
                            to Red China. We are agreed that the considerations set forth in my

                                    <ref target="#d281"><hi rend="italic">supra</hi></ref>.</note>
                            encourage us to believe that Department and <gloss target="#t_FOAW1"
                                >FOA/W</gloss> share our view that if at all possible we should
                            avoid taking a position ourselves from which there could be no retreat
                            and which would force us to halt US aid to Indonesia if the <hi
                                rend="italic">Pulaski</hi> actually sails to a Red Chinese port. The
                            following thoughts are predicated on this assumption and on the further
                            assumption that some initiative should be taken by our side to assist
                            the Indonesians from taking a position from which they cannot
                            recede.</p>
                        <p>It will be clear to Department from my reports of the past few days that
                            practically all political elements (there have been only <pb n="448"
                                xml:id="pg_448" facs="0468"/>three Indonesian newspapers which have
                            expressed the contrary position) are already reacting unfavorably to
                            what the press terms “punishment” by US for violation <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> embargo—and all this even before any
                            rubber has actually been shipped. This attitude is accentuated by fact
                            that same rubber can be shipped to Soviet Union and Soviet satellites
                            and even to Red China itself via Soviet and satellite ports. The
                            Indonesians are also well aware (as stated in <gloss target="#t_Deptel1"
                                >Deptel</gloss> 39) of current moves towards relaxation <gloss
                                target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> controls. Up to now (and I labor
                            the point that so far we have no specific evidence that a final decision
                            has been made in this matter) the Indonesians have loyally supported
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> embargo. Apparently they think
                            they are now reaching the end of their rope: domestic considerations;
                            the example of Ceylon; cessation of actual hostilities in Korea; a
                            confused idea of what an “independent policy” calls for; and perhaps the
                            desire to throw an anchor to windward in view of Communist successes in
                            Indochina; perhaps even the feeling that US differences with its British
                            and French allies weaken the US position—all these factors must, I
                            think, be influencing the thinking of Indonesian Government leaders and
                            even opposition leaders.</p>
                        <p>Assuming it is in the over-all interest of the US to try to adopt such
                            course of action as will obviate the necessity for termination of aid,
                            Embassy and <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> recommend for
                            consideration the following:</p>
                        <p>We believe that rather than let the situation continue to drift until
                            some climax is reached disadvantageous to both Indonesia and ourselves,
                            we should take the initiative in seeking to establish a climate
                            conducive to a realistic study of what is after all a mutual problem.
                            Rightly or wrongly Indonesians share with many other Asians a belief
                            that the US does not take into account their problems and their point of
                            view in the same way that they think we do with our European friends. If
                            we can discuss this rubber problem with them frankly and confidentially
                            we will at least have done what we could to impress upon them that we do
                            wish to try to understand their viewpoint and that given time and
                            opportunity and their confidence we will do our best to arrive at a
                            solution not unfavorable to their interests.</p>
                        <p>In other words our proposal is to discuss the entire matter with the
                            Prime Minister in a cooperative, helpful manner but one designed to
                            bring about solution of the matter in accordance with our views; that is
                            if possible to induce the Indonesian Government to stop the shipment. It
                            should be remembered Indonesian Government has not yet admitted ship’s
                            destination is Red China; that Prime Minister is “looking into matter”;
                            and he has easy out if he wishes by diverting shipment to Polish
                            port.</p>

                            discussion in the foregoing conciliatory vein unless events have
                            overtaken us. So as not to commit the Department or <gloss

                        <p>I think that time is of the essence if we are not to lose the possibility
                            of an initiative made in face of the rising tide of adverse press
                            treatment.</p>

                            such a suggestion while Ali in Washington. He said that it was important
                            from Indonesia standpoint that such discussions in no way take the <pb

                        <p>I said that naturally I did not envisage such discussions branching out
                            to include American domestic legislation such as Battle Act or recession
                            from position already taken by US and as, for example, with regard to

                                reasoning behind and the questions raised by the proposal outlined
                                in the circular telegram. (Djakarta Embassy files, 501.1

                        <p>In general our reply to basic question is strong affirmative, recognizing
                            (a) considerable differences existing between various categories of
                            Asian countries as to willingness to utilize aid to further US
                            objectives re checking spread of communism; (b) that economic assistance
                            per <gloss target="#t_SE1">se</gloss> is not necessarily a panacea for
                            communism and that friendship cannot be bought with dollars; and (c)
                            that in some Asian countries at least economic aid should have no
                            political strings attached, although sound fiscal policy and
                            administration should ever be an objective (and these we do not have in
                            Indonesia).</p>
                        <p>We can safely assume that Japan, Korea, Formosa, Philippines, Thailand
                            would use both military and economic assistance to strengthen their
                            resistance to communism, both externally and domestic. On other hand, as
                            we see situation from Djakarta, India, Burma and Ceylon are prone to be
                            tolerant to communism as way of life in nearby states, refusing to
                            recognize potential exterior threat of Soviet-Sino communism while
                            taking relatively severe measures to suppress and eradicate communism
                            from within. Indonesia under its present Cabinet for moment seems
                            unwilling to do either without equivocation.</p>
                        <p>Technical assistance and economic aid programs cannot be effective in
                            this part of world if designed to remake country in our own image. They
                            must be genuine offers of financial assistance during a period of crisis
                            or of technical assistance to enable more efficient and effective
                            accomplishment host country’s own objectives to extent consonant with
                            our interests and objectives. Such programs manifestly make positive
                            contributions to economic progress, and wisely handled, help promote
                            improved relationships between US and host country, tending to offset
                            Communist exploitation as direct and indirect contacts of population
                            with programs increase. Programs of training, development of economic
                            resources, productive capacity and improved trade provide these
                            countries with tools and know-how, but, above all, hope and confidence
                            in future. This is especially true in Asian countries like Indonesia,
                            where suspicion already exists even in non-Communist circles that US is
                            trying to buy support against communism and where such support simply is
                            not directly for sale.</p>
                        <p>In Indonesia, for example, deteriorating economic and financial position
                            makes it desirable from both standpoint of Indonesians <pb n="454"
                                xml:id="pg_454" facs="0474"/>and US that additional aid be provided.
                            Yet Indonesians, we are convinced, would rather do without aid than sell
                            or even open the door to charges of selling their “independent foreign
                            policy”. Again, this does not mean they are Communist-oriented. Yet for
                            US to refuse to consider aid except on conditions a neutral-minded,
                            uncommitted, country could not accept would, we firmly believe, be
                            playing into hands of enemy. In saying this we do not intend imply that
                            offer of aid to Indonesia should necessarily be extended at this time;

                                had stated: “I repeat what I have said before: badly as Indonesia
                                needs financial aid, I cannot recommend that our government either
                                grant such aid through its own agencies or encourage its provision
                                by private investors until the Indonesians have put their own house

                                of intention to do so. And this, of course, includes real and

                        <p>Nevertheless, continuing review of situation here considering combination
                            of factors, political, financial and economic, external as well as
                            internal, which have been spelled out in reference telegrams, have
                            forced us to conclusion that time will come, perhaps within months when
                            US interest would dictate substantial additional assistance to this
                            country. We strongly urge, therefore, that steps be taken to firm up
                            policy decisions so action may be taken promptly if, as and when deemed
                            desirable. Such aid, if it is to halt deterioration of <gloss

                            assistance programs. We would urge that consideration be given to
                            establishing a sizeable reserve fund for <gloss target="#t_Indo1"
                                >Indo</gloss> aid, such to be granted in manner and at time when
                            greatest political capital could be obtained.</p>
                        <p>For time being, however, any substantial expansion of economic aid to
                            Indonesia might tend to strengthen present coalition although in
                            considering timing and nature of increased US aid we should consider
                            possibilities that successor government might be less, as well as more,
                            favorably disposed to closer ties with US than present government.

                        <p>Turning to organizational aspects of expanded Asian economic aid
                            programs, time may now be ripe to propose some form of economic
                            association of Asian States, entirely disassociated from military
                            organization, modelled perhaps on <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>.
                            We are convinced undesirable to tie our hands by limiting to <gloss
                                target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> countries. It will be recalled that
                                <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> provided the first friendly
                            table after war around which Germans could sit and discuss mutual
                            problems with their former enemies. It may be that this pattern holds
                            something for Asia and if so every effort should be made to obtain
                            participation by all Asian countries, including Japan, Korea and
                            Formosa. Although this apparently impracticable in area of military
                            association at present time, trade and economic development may provide
                            sufficient mutual interest for cooperation, especially if sparked by
                            substantial US aid. In any event, vigorous efforts should, in our
                            opinion, be exerted in this direction. We do not believe that <gloss
                                target="#t_ECAFE1">ECAFE</gloss>, because of Soviet participation,
                            can meet our and Asian needs any more than its Geneva counterpart could
                            meet European needs for same reason.</p>
                        <p>Whether Indonesia could be attracted into such an association remains to
                            be seen but we think it worth trying. If India and Burma could be
                            brought in, <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>s while not slavishly
                            following Nehru’s lead probably would not want to be isolated from joint
                            concern which India and Burma saw fit to join; otherwise unquestionably
                            not.</p>

                                Ambassador on July 28. (756D.11/7–2654)</note> President received me
                            very cordially this morning. Said he had heard I was going to US on
                            leave and wanted to be sure of seeing me before I went. He was pleased
                            that I had planned to stay Djakarta until after Independence Day
                            celebrations August 17, remarking that my absence would have been noted
                            by anti-American press, and adding “I personally am very sorry your

                        <p>Sukarno said he could not order American Ambassadors around but if I had
                            been called home on consultation about this time, he would have found
                            some means to suggest to me the advisability of trying to explain the
                            Indonesian scene in person. He said that his job and he thought mine
                            also was complicated by such items as appeared in the July 19 issue of
                                <hi rend="italic">Newsweek</hi> saying that Indonesia would be the
                            next target of Communist aggression. He said that only foolish people or
                            Communists could believe that the cease-fire in Indochina meant an end
                            to Communist aggression in Southeast Asia or even more than a temporary
                            halt in the development of such plans as the Communists might have for
                            further advances in Asia. He said “We [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] have
                            now lost Indochina” but that it was not yet Indonesia which was in
                            direct danger but rather all Southeast Asia, more especially
                            Thailand.”</p>
                        <p>Sukarno said he felt that it was now more important than ever that US
                            find some way to appeal to the bulk of Indonesian people and restore
                            high regard Indonesian people had for US until past two or three years.
                            Sukarno said he felt US and American people could be best and most
                            influential friends that Indonesia could have. He wanted to assure me
                            that he was doing all he could consistent with Indonesian independent
                            policy and requirements of his office not only to combat tendencies to
                            regard Communist countries as the real friends of Indonesia but also to
                            explain in private conversations his understanding apparent
                            inconsistencies between American action or rather as he put it, inaction
                            with regard to Irian and American stated anti-imperialism and
                            anti-colonialism. Accordingly he very sincerely hoped that we could make
                            some gesture <pb n="457" xml:id="pg_457" facs="0477"/>to recognize
                            legitimacy of Indonesians’ claim in Irian. He said he thought he
                            understood thoroughly, although yet he did not agree, the dilemma posed
                            by our alliance with Netherlands and our friendly feelings toward
                            Indonesia but his people, particularly in the rest of the country, did
                            not understand and the Communists were carrying on most active campaign
                            to prevent them from understanding. (Courtesy forbade me observing his
                            own part in whipping-up of Irian campaign.)</p>
                        <p>He asked me bluntly whether we of US Government had ever given the Dutch
                            any form of assurance our support of Dutch claims in Irian and also
                            whether any individuals in American Government as distinguished from
                            government itself advocated Dutch claims to Irian. To the first question
                            I replied in the sense of first paragraph <gloss target="#t_Deptel1"
                                >Deptel</gloss> 846:<note n="2" xml:id="d287fn2">Dated Apr. 10, not

                            far as I knew ever informed either Dutch or Indonesians that we
                            recognized Dutch sovereignty. To his second question I replied that
                            obviously I could not give a comprehensive reply but that I could say
                            that while both sides of question naturally were discussed from time to
                            time in light of American interests, I had not heard any responsible
                            person come out flatly with advocacy of Dutch or Indonesian sovereignty
                            claims; that any persons with whom I talked over the problem felt that,
                            properly handled, a settlement could be finally reached which would be
                            satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>Referring to Communism in Indonesia, Sukarno said very much what Vice
                            President Hatta said to me a week ago: That he was encouraged by the
                            progress which was being slowly made toward countering the growth of
                            domestic Communist influence; that for example whereas a year or two ago
                                <gloss target="#t_SOBSI1">SOBSI</gloss> was without question “the
                            crowned king of Indonesian labor” he felt that <gloss target="#t_SOBSI1"
                                >SOBSI</gloss> influence was now somewhat on the wane and that
                                <gloss target="#t_Masjumi1">Masjumi</gloss> and other non-Communist
                            labor organizations had reason to be more hopeful now than formerly.
                                (<hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> I think the President’s statement
                            is overly optimistic but I think it worth noting that Hatta should in

                        <p>The conversation lasted nearly an hour and was friendly and calm, the
                            President convincingly expressing his real friendship for US. He
                            especially requested that the President and Vice President be informed
                            of the essence of conversation<note n="3" xml:id="d287fn3">The substance

                            way—to strike a response from the heart of Indonesian people and thus
                            help him to combat Communist influence and promote understanding and

                            regard Sukarno’s statement to me a part of his continuing and persistent
                            efforts to leave no stone unturned in seeking US support for Indonesian
                            Irian claim. Statements of Indonesian officials both here and in
                            Washington suggest strongly that general policy instructions have gone
                            out to talk up Indonesian claim and make bid for US support or at least
                            benevolent neutrality. I am certain that anything short of outright
                            espousal Indonesian position would not have any effect at this time on
                            Sukarno and Indonesian attitude either towards <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                                >SEATO</gloss> or US, and I have strong doubts that even such
                            espousal if it were made, would to any significant degree at this time
                            further any specific US policy objectives this area although it would
                            produce some warming of Indonesian Government and public opinion towards
                            US.</p>
                        <p>Department through <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> may now be in
                            better position to estimate likelihood Indonesian effort to place Irian
                            on UNGA agenda. From Djakarta vantage point, however, it does not appear
                            that government has decided yet on the matter. I suspect that Foreign
                            Office, which would be responsible for carrying out affirmative
                            decision, is dragging its feet and counseling against it. Hanifah, the
                            person most likely to prepare a broad groundwork for UNGA effort, is
                            still in Djakarta. Hague negotiations, monopolizing considerable portion
                            Indonesian diplomatic manpower and attention, unlikely to be terminated
                            before end second week in August, and mid-August agenda closing date is
                            fast approaching. At present only PKI and affiliates are calling for
                            UNGA action, and even [garble] of Irian Bureau, Sukarno’s direct
                            mouthpiece on Irian questions, is talking vaguely only of working out
                            Dutch-Indonesian differences on Irian within framework “<gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Regulations”. Placing Irian before World
                            Court may be in back of their minds. Above leads me to believe,
                            therefore, that although final decision has not been reached, scales now
                            weighed against Indonesian effort put Irian problem before Ninth Session

                            U.S. Army officers as instructors on an individual contract basis. I
                            understand that this matter is being carefully studied by the Department
                            of Defense.</p>
                        <p>We continue to believe that an arrangement under which U.S. Army officers
                            would be assigned as instructors to the Indonesian Army would, if in
                            response to a specific request, be helpful to the achievement of U.S.
                            objectives in Indonesia even though it might not be in conformity with
                            arrangements we have with other countries on military training. We have
                            had no further discussion with the Indonesian Government about their
                            desire for military instructors, however, and we would not be able to
                            implement any plan in this field in the absence of a firm Indonesian
                            request.</p>
                        <p>I also refer to the Deputy Under Secretary’s letter to you of the same
                                date<note n="2" xml:id="d290fn2">Not printed.</note> concerning the

                            stated that while Defense was wholly in accord on the desirability of
                            providing U.S. training for Indonesian Army officers, <gloss
                                target="#t_MATS1">MATS</gloss> transportation was precluded by lack
                            of legally expendable Defense funds for this purpose.</p>
                        <p>On July 7, 1954 the Operations Coordinating Board took note of the fact
                            that Indonesia had requested an increase in the number of places in U.S.
                            military schools from 45 in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 to
                            137 in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            <pb n="461" xml:id="pg_461" facs="0481"/>1955. The Board agreed on the
                            importance to the U.S. of insuring uninterrupted training of Indonesian
                            Army officers in this country and cited to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> the problem of providing transportation to them as one
                            of the major emerging problems with which the Departments were
                            concerned. The minutes of the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss>
                            meeting (agenda item 2, paragraph C) show that the Board “agreed on the
                            importance to national security of bringing Indonesian officer trainees
                            to the U.S., requested Defense to explore ways and means of financing
                            the travel of the trainees to and from the U.S., and requested the other
                            interested agencies to study what assistance they can offer in this
                            connection.” It was my understanding that Defense would finance the
                            travel of Indonesian officer trainees by issuing them “invitational
                            orders”.</p>

                        <p>Sukarno from outset has been the prime leader in all moves to bring Irian

                            party which does not subscribe to belief that Irian is by rights
                            Indonesian. Most leaders have, however, felt that it was not expedient
                            or wise to press forward as rapidly as Sukarno desired or as his
                            patriotic demagoguery on the subject required; on the other hand no
                            leader or party could afford to be placed in a position of open
                            opposition to steps proposed by Sukarno “to complete the revolution by

                            discuss the question which has forced Sukarno equally firmly to insist
                            upon discussion.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador Mukarto called today at our request.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Robertson referred to the conversation of August 13 between the
                            Deputy Under Secretary and the Ambassador at which the <pb n="464"
                                xml:id="pg_464" facs="0484"/>latter delivered a note<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d292fn1">Not printed.</note> informing us of Indonesia’s
                            intention to place the New Guinea question before the UNGA. Mr.
                            Robertson said the US values the friendship of both Indonesia and the
                            Netherlands that the latter are our allies in Europe. He said when two
                            friends disagree as fundamentally in approach and opinion as the
                            Netherlands and Indonesia disagree on the question of Irian the US is
                            put in a difficult position. He said the US is neutral in the dispute
                            and will therefore abstain and take no positive action. He said it was
                            hoped we could, by taking this position, avoid action which could be
                            interpreted by either side as favoring the other.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Mukarto replied that he was glad to receive this information,
                            and that he desired to express the appreciation of his government for
                            it. He said he felt his government understood the difficult position of
                            the US with respect to doing anything harmful to US–Netherlands
                            relations. He said he would inform his government immediately and he was
                            sure his government would appreciate the US position of neutrality.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Mukarto concluded by saying the Indonesian Government
                            recognizes the need for restraint and desires to avoid creating an
                            opportunity for the Communists to broaden the issue. He said Indonesia
                            will act in this spirit in the UNGA.</p>

                                Guinea and as a result, despite our attempts at discussion,
                                Indonesia has asked that the New Guinea question be placed on the

                                transfer of sovereignty. The Netherlands and Australia will oppose
                                inscription and discussion in the UNGA. Both the Netherlands and
                                Indonesia have requested our support. We have replied by stating our

                                            Secretary of Defense dated September 17, 1954 and the
                                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> memorandum
                                            enclosed therein dated August 31, 1954 on the subject of
                                            military training assistance to Indonesia. The
                                            Ambassador said he did not think the sending of an
                                            individual or a group to Indonesia to make a survey of
                                            Indonesia’s training needs would be advisable at the
                                            present time and probably not until after elections. He
                                            said the Embassy’s best estimate is that the elections
                                            will be held sometime in mid–1955 and that those
                                            non-Communist and anti-Communist political elements
                                            amenable to cooperation with the U.S. are expected to
                                            win the elections. The Ambassador said it was his
                                            opinion that elections would bring some greater degree
                                            of stability to the Indonesian Government and would
                                            perhaps permit the implementation of U.S. military
                                            training assistance to Indonesia in some form. The
                                            Ambassador said that meanwhile Indonesian Army and Naval
                                            officers are being trained in the U.S. in increased
                                            numbers which would permit a more efficient use of
                                            American training in Indonesia at a later date.…</p>
                                        <p>“Admiral Radford expressed interest in Ambassador
                                            Cumming’s brief survey of the situation. He said he did
                                            not believe Defense expected any immediate or dramatic
                                            results from Indonesia and he agreed with the Ambassador
                                            that the time of any survey of Indonesia’s military
                                            training needs would await the Embassy’s and the
                                            Department’s recommendations.”

                                <p>On Nov. 12, Chargé John M. Steeves talked with Foreign Minister
                                    Sunario about several topics affecting U.S.-Indonesian
                                    relations. The concluding portion of Steeves’ memorandum of
                                    conversation, sent to the Department on Nov. 16, reads as
                                    follows:</p>
                                <p>“The Foreign Minister again referred to how difficult it was to
                                    pursue a strictly independent policy and not have it
                                    misunderstood by the United States as a soft attitude towards
                                    Communism. It seemed to me that the occasion was ripe for a
                                    positive suggestion to the Foreign Minister, and I told him that
                                    I thought that one thing that would help would be for Indonesia
                                    to exhibit a little more real neutrality in the public
                                    utterances of its leaders. In recalling the fact that we had had
                                    several conversations recently about his concern over adverse
                                    comment in the United States press on affairs in Indonesia, I
                                    said that some of the current utterances by the President and
                                    the Prime Minister were likely to be misunderstood in the United
                                    States and produce a further spate of the very type of comment
                                    he wished to avoid. I pointed out to him that some Americans
                                    felt that a truly neutral policy did not consist in reminding
                                    the Indonesian people from the public platform that Indonesia
                                    was not going to succumb to American blandishments and in a
                                    variety of ways insinuate that America was the power to be
                                    feared and that keeping the U.S. at arm’s length was the essence
                                    of neutrality. I told him that I thought Indonesian spokesmen
                                    could do much to allay the fears of those who claimed that
                                    Indonesia was moving in the direction of the Communist world if
                                    they would a little more openly give assurances that they were
                                    not under the spell of Communist China or if they were a little
                                    less afraid to criticize the Soviets. He took the suggestion
                                    very well and said that maybe they had been remiss, and he would
                                    give this some definite thought.” (Enclosure to despatch 263;

                                abnormal stock situation had developed in Indonesia.

                        <p>The Netherlands Ambassador called today at his request to present the
                            Secretary with the first draft of a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            resolution on West New Guinea prepared by the Netherlands and Australia
                            (see attachment).<note n="1" xml:id="d298fn1">Not printed. This draft
                                resolution was not formally presented to the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                    >U.N.</gloss> General Assembly.</note> The Ambassador said that
                            the draft resolution had been approved by the Netherlands cabinet and
                            would, he anticipated, be introduced into the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> by some third country acting as sponsor. His Government
                            very much hoped that the United States would find it possible to support
                            this resolution and vote for it.</p>
                        <pb n="475" xml:id="pg_475" facs="0495"/>
                        <p>Dr. van Roijen drew the Secretary’s attention to the fourth paragraph of
                            the Preamble and the fourth paragraph of the Resolution, itself, which
                            confirm the willingness of the Netherlands Government to give the
                            inhabitants of West New Guinea the opportunity to determine their own
                            future. He said that he hoped that the positive aspects of the
                            Netherlands-Australian draft would appeal to the U.S. Government as well
                            as those of other member states of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether the Indonesian Government would favor a
                            resolution such as that drafted by the Netherlands and Australia or
                            whether that Government intended to introduce a resolution of its own.
                            The Ambassador replied that the Indonesia Government, he understood, had
                            different ideas; that its resolution would probably call for
                            negotiations between the Netherlands and Indonesia thus emphasizing the
                            necessity for settlement of a dispute which the Netherlands Government
                            cannot admit is required.<note n="2" xml:id="d298fn2">An Indonesian
                                resolution along the lines indicated was presented subsequently to

                                A/C.1/L.109, but was not pressed to a vote.</note></p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked what chance of success the Indonesian resolution
                            might have and the Ambassador referred to the unresolved question of
                            voting on this matter by two-thirds or by a simple majority which will,
                            of course, have a significant effect upon the outcome of the voting on
                            any resolution related to this issue.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we were, of course, very anxious that certain of
                            these areas not pass into Communist hands and, turning to a map of the
                            Pacific, he pointed to the chain of strategic islands which ran from the
                            Aleutians down through Japan, Formosa, and the Philippines, to New
                            Guinea and Australia. He said that there were other areas which we also
                            were most anxious should not fall to the Communist side. This, he
                            continued, was the basis for our policy that we do nothing to push the
                            Government of Indonesia off its delicate balance on to the wrong side,
                            particularly in the light of recent indications that the political
                            situation in Djakarta was, from the standpoint of the West, improving
                            and in the light of the forthcoming national elections. After very
                            careful soul-searching the U.S. Government had decided that it must
                            continue to maintain its policy of strict neutrality in this New Guinea
                            question although admittedly this was not a glorious posture. Certainly
                            if only the welfare of the inhabitants of West New Guinea were concerned
                            we would have to admit that development toward ultimate political
                            self-determination would be better assured under the present rule.
                            However, the Secretary concluded, there were many other important <pb
                                n="476" xml:id="pg_476" facs="0496"/>factors involved and, for the
                            political considerations referred to above, he felt that we must
                            maintain our neutral policy in this particular issue. The Ambassador
                            replied that he knew his Government would be disappointed but that he
                            would do his best to explain to it the Secretary’s reasons for this
                                decision.<note n="3" xml:id="d298fn3">In a subsequent memorandum of
                                Nov. 12 to Secretary Dulles, Jones stated that the Netherlands
                                Ambassador had transmitted his government’s disappointment at the
                                U.S. position, conveyed after he had informed it of his talk with
                                Dulles. The Netherlands Government wished to emphasize that, in its
                                opinion, a vote in favor of the Netherlands-Australian resolution
                                could not be construed as procolonial in view of the resolution’s
                                explicit provision for ultimate self-determination by the indigenous
                                population. (656.56C13/11–1254)</note></p>

                        <p>The President on July 16, 1954 directed the <gloss target="#t_OCB1"
                                >OCB</gloss> to develop a feasible integrated program with respect
                            to the rubber problem of Southwest Asia, particularly Indonesia, and to
                            report to the Council with estimates of the general magnitude of costs.
                            Such a paper was prepared by the Department (<gloss target="#t_OMP1"
                                >OMP</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PSA1">PSA</gloss>) in conjunction
                            with <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>, approved by the <gloss
                                target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss>, and submitted to the <gloss

                            5417/3 on September 24, 1954. The paper recommended, as a course of
                            action to improve the Indonesian smallholder rubber situation, the
                            planting of 380,000 acres with new high-yielding rubber trees, the
                            establishment of cooperative processing centers with working capital to
                            buy rubber from smallholders, and the establishment of schools to teach
                            smallholders approved methods of planting, tapping, and processing. The
                            paper also recommended that Indonesia should bear as much of the cost as
                            feasible but recognized that economic conditions in Indonesia at present
                            are such as to suggest that the United States be prepared to underwrite
                            a substantial portion of the total. The total cost of the program is
                            estimated at $60 million over a twelve-year period. All but $3 to $5
                            million of the total would be local currency costs. The United <pb

                                A/C.1/SR.735. The resolution was approved by a vote of 34 to 14,
                                with 10 abstentions (including the United States). The Netherlands
                                voted against the resolution, while Indonesia abstained. The General
                                Assembly did not take up the question until Dec. 10.</note></p>

                            <item>Without prejudice to our decision to abstain on the merits of this
                                question, both in committee and in plenary (with which decision I
                                heartily agree) I strongly recommend for the following reasons that
                                we take the position in the plenary, if the question arises, that
                                this matter requires a two-thirds vote. <list>

                                    <item>It is clear that the question is in fact an important one
                                        within the spirit and letter of the Charter. Indonesia
                                        raised it under Articles 35, 10, and 14 of the Charter as “a
                                        latent threat to the peace and security of that part of the
                                        world” (A/2964). The question therefore clearly falls within
                                        the first category of “important” questions stipulated in
                                        Article 18(2) of the Charter on which all decisions require
                                        a two-thirds vote.</item>

                                    <item>By taking this position we will, to a considerable extent,
                                        be strengthening our own future position regarding Chinese
                                        representation if and when the question of whether Chinese
                                        representation requires a two-thirds vote arises. If we vote
                                        that this is not an important question, we weaken our future
                                        position to an even greater extent.</item>

                                because of the US position of abstention on the merits while all of
                                the other vice-presidents have taken positions on one side or the
                                other. Furthermore, if I were in the chair I would be better able to
                                control any procedural debate that might arise on the two-thirds
                                question. If I were in the chair I would plan not to make a ruling
                                on this question since I do not consider that it is within the
                                competence of the chair to rule on it. I would put the question to
                                the assembly for decision by a majority vote and in the course of
                                the procedural debate I would recognize an appropriate

                        <p>I think you should not have to be embarrassed by being in President’s
                            chair when critical procedural decision on New Guinea item arises. If a
                            vote must be taken on question whether two-thirds majority on New Guinea
                            resolution is required in plenary, I am inclined to agree with you that
                            question is in fact important and that we should vote accordingly.
                            However, I should hope that plenary would not have to decide this
                            question but that it should vote first and then if necessary decide
                            afterwards whether ⅔ vote required. In view of 34–14 vote in committee
                            it would seem that decision on “importance” would never have to be
                                taken.<note n="2" xml:id="d301fn2"><p>The principal drafter of this
                                    telegram was Assistant Secretary of State for International
                                    Organization Affairs David McK. Key. On the preceding day, he
                                    had sent a memorandum to Dulles reporting on a meeting held in
                                    the office of Deputy Under Secretary of State Murphy. Part of
                                    that memorandum reads as follows:</p>
                                <p>“In a meeting in Mr. Murphy’s office today, Mr. Robertson took
                                    the position that our policy of neutrality covers all aspects of
                                    the matter and requires us to abstain; whatever benefit we might
                                    obtain from this policy would be dissipated by our voting with
                                    the Dutch in support of the ⅔ rule and thus possibly helping to
                                    defeat the resolution.</p>
                                <p>“I argued that our neutrality could not be considered to cover
                                    this important procedural question; this matter involves a
                                    dispute over sovereignty over an extensive territory and should
                                    therefore be considered ‘an important question’ under Article 18
                                    of the Charter, particularly since in view of the growing
                                    influence of the anti-colonial and underdeveloped group the ⅔
                                    rule in political matters of this sort would operate in our
                                    national interest as a barrier to extremist moves in the
                                    Assembly. Mr. Elbrick generally supported my position.” (<gloss

                            American delegations, to let them know that we do not necessarily expect
                            them to vote as we did, and that they <pb n="482" xml:id="pg_482"

                            Minister’s representations “for consideration” as to what, if any, steps
                            the U.S. could take to meet the wishes of the Netherlands Government in
                            this matter.” (Tab A)<note n="1" xml:id="d303fn1">Not printed.

                        <p>I also refer to memorandum of conversation dated December 6, 1954 also on
                            this subject, in which the Netherlands Minister thanked Mr. Wainhouse
                            “for the action taken” and said that “he thought this procedure had

                            the Secretary has enunciated clearly that we should refrain from
                            lobbying. If you believe there is any need for an additional instruction

                                <p>In the evening of Dec. 10, at its 509th plenary meeting, the
                                    General Assembly voted on the eight-power resolution (see <ref
                                        target="#d300">Document 300</ref>). Van Kleffens, presiding,
                                    put to the Assembly the view expressed by several delegations in
                                    debate that this was an important question requiring approval by
                                    a two-thirds majority. It was so decided without debate. The
                                    preamble and operative paragraphs were then voted on separately
                                    with each part receiving a simple but not a required two-thirds
                                    majority vote of approval. The resolution as a whole was thus
                                    not put to a vote. The United States abstained in each vote. For

                        <p>929. I saw the President this morning. He was affable, relaxed, and
                            exuded confidence during my half-hour conversation. He showed none of
                            the signs of physical debility which some of my colleagues have told me
                            have appeared since September.</p>
                        <p>I communicated in formal terms the greetings of President Eisenhower and
                            Vice President Nixon, which he appropriately acknowledged.</p>
                        <p>After amenities Sukarno referred to the Irian question but in mild terms,
                            confining himself to a moderate elaboration of his well-known thesis
                            that by not supporting the Indonesian point of view the US was helping
                            the Communists in Indonesia in their efforts to identify communism with
                            anti-colonialism and support of nationalist aspirations. He also
                            remarked that our policy was losing us the understanding of Asia
                            generally: “What are ten million Dutchmen as compared to one billion
                            Asians not to mention the peoples of the Middle East”. I told the
                            President, smilingly, that he sounded a little as if he were making a
                            speech; that he had perhaps overlooked in the understandable intensity
                            of his feelings over Irian the fact that amongst the Asian peoples
                            Japan, Korea, Philippines, Thailand and Pakistan were associated with us
                            in a mutual defense pact; that Turkey was our ally in <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>; that Iran and other important states
                            of the Middle East had mutual security agreements with us. I said
                            therefore that I thought it was a slight exaggeration to say that the US
                            and its aims and purposes in standing against communism and aggression
                            and colonialism were not understood by the peoples of the East. The
                            President limited his reply to saying that our agreements were with
                            governments and did not <pb n="485" xml:id="pg_485" facs="0505"
                            />necessarily reflect mass opinion. We did not pursue this subject
                            further.</p>
                        <p>He asked me what were my first impressions of Indonesia upon my return
                            and I said that (paragraph B 3 <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss>
                                777)<note n="1" xml:id="d305fn1"><ref target="#d304"><hi
                                        rend="italic">Supra</hi></ref>.</note> I had been struck by
                            the highly charged political atmosphere and especially by the apparently
                            increasing success of the PKI identifying themselves not only with
                            Indonesian nationalist elements and goals but also with the <gloss
                                target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> party. He replied that the increased
                            tensions which I had noticed were due to the recent parliamentary debate
                            on the no-confidence motion and might be expected to continue during the
                            next pre-election months. With regard to increase in Communist
                            influence, he said that this was largely due to Communist success, as he
                            had previously mentioned, in selling themselves to the Indonesian people
                            as anti-colonialists. “Every political development in this country,” he
                            said, “has its origin in nationalism and anti-colonialism”. I asked if I
                            might speak frankly and, with his permission, said that while this was
                            to a great extent true, I had been disappointed to hear so few
                            Indonesian voices raised to explain the aims of US policy including our
                            determined stand against communism while so many voices, some those of
                            non-Communists, seemed eager to take almost any opportunity to present
                            the distortions of the Soviet bloc. I said that even some of his own
                            speeches had in English translation been so worded as to be susceptible
                            of distortion on this point. Sukarno then said that the present
                            government was embarrassed by PKI support but (repeating what the Prime
                            Minister has said over and over again) no politician could reject a
                            vote. I referred to Mendès-France’s<note n="2" xml:id="d305fn2">Pierre
                                Mendès-France, Premier of France.</note> statement at the time he
                            sought investiture that he would not accept office unless he had a
                            majority excluding the Communist vote. He laughed and said Indonesia was
                            not France.</p>
                        <p>I then went back to his statement that tension might be expected to
                            continue during the pre-election period and said (paragraph A 1
                            Department telegram 777) that both President Eisenhower and Vice
                            President Nixon had expressed great interest in the progress so far made
                            towards the holding of Indonesian national elections and I observed that
                            many speculations had come to my attention in Indonesia as well as
                            elsewhere that the elections would not be held in 1955 and would be
                            postponed from time to time on some pretext or other. The President said
                            there are many difficulties, not all of which are technical, in the way
                            of holding the first general elections in this country but that he felt
                            they would be held. Sukarno said that no one would welcome elections
                            more than he himself. <pb n="486" xml:id="pg_486" facs="0506"/>That
                            until elections were held he could have no certain knowledge as to which
                            political party was in fact the strongest in the country and he was
                            beset by claims from <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss>, <gloss
                                target="#t_Masjumi1">Masjumi</gloss> and even PKI that each had the
                            greater strength and more truly represented the mass of Indonesian
                            people.</p>
                        <p>I said that, speaking as a friend, I thought it would be useful if some
                            categorical statement could be made by someone in authority to the
                            effect that the elections would be held in 1955; he said that I might
                            tell my President that “the elections must and shall be held”. I thanked
                            him for this assurance and said that I would communicate it to my
                            government but I wondered if it would not help if such a statement were
                            made publicly. He laughed and said, “you are indeed a friend to make the
                            suggestion and I will make such a statement in my speech at the <gloss
                                target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> party reception at Bandung this coming
                                Saturday.”<note n="3" xml:id="d305fn3">Dec. 18. See telegram 970,

                            Sukarno said that if he made such a statement on such an occasion it
                            would be taken as a commitment by <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> as
                            well as by the press; that many people in Indonesia charge him with

                            this year as he had done some years ago. He replied that he had not been
                            invited.</p>

                        <p>970. I had an hour’s conversation with Vice President Hatta this morning,
                            gave him greetings from Vice President Nixon and (all paragraph

                                304</ref>.</note> regarding paragraph A1 expressed President
                            Eisenhower and Vice President Nixon’s interest in election progress,
                            saying critics of Indonesia abroad as well as in country were continuing
                            to charge that elections would be indefinitely postponed. Hatta
                            expressed confidence that elections would be held in 1955; that former
                            Minister Home Affairs Hazarain had done everything possible to obstruct
                            progress, believing that <gloss target="#t_PIR1">PIR</gloss> would
                            disappear (which Hatta said it probably would) <pb n="487"
                                xml:id="pg_487" facs="0507"/>when elections held; that new Home
                            Minister Soenarjo was determined to push forward with elections because
                            his party, Nu, was steadily losing strength due to Moslem criticism of
                            Nu’s participation in government and consequent indirect association
                            with PKI. While <gloss target="#t_PIR1">PIR</gloss>’s existence depended
                            upon postponement elections, Nu’s existence and possibility of
                            participation in <gloss target="#t_Masjumi1">Masjumi</gloss> Government
                            depended on early elections before their voting strength had waned. I
                            stressed personal feeling public statement by some one other than Prime
                            Minister that elections would be held was important and said I wondered
                            why President Sukarno had made no reference to this point in his <gloss
                                target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> party speech at Bandung despite his
                            assertion to me that he would. Hatta said he agreed with my view as to
                            importance such statement and would try to say something in one of his
                            speeches.</p>
                        <p>Re paragraph B3. Hatta considers Aidit’s claims substantial expansion PKI
                            membership grossly exaggerated. He thinks there have been slight gains
                            in party membership (he disclaims knowledge actual figures but agreed
                            with my suggestion that they might be in the order of 25,000 to 30,000
                            card holders) but thought that voting strength was “fairly large” due
                            first to their successful identification of PKI program with <gloss
                                target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> and other nationalist programs; second,
                            to increased participation of highly placed dupes in front
                            organizations; and third, government’s support of PKI adoption of hammer
                            and sickle insignia on ballots to include PKI and non-party voters.
                            Hatta considers, and I agree, greatest Communist danger is in continued
                            infiltration of intellectual circles and continued compromises by <gloss
                                target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> to retain PKI support—he minimizes
                            danger of Communist coup even if elections go against <gloss
                                target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> “and when <gloss target="#t_Masjumi1"
                                >Masjumi</gloss> come into power”.</p>
                        <p>I asked Hatta his view as to importance that should be attached to the
                            new rumors I had heard of increasing dissatisfaction with leftward
                            trends of government policy amongst government officials, younger
                            intellectuals and especially within the Army. He said there was no doubt
                            but that many of these people including some moderate <gloss
                                target="#t_Masjumi1">Masjumi</gloss> party members were beginning to
                            feel situation was so serious as to require some “strong action”. He
                            said that an important contribution to political stability lay in the
                            increasing success of efforts by all army officer factions to reconcile
                            their differences and unite. I asked whether he thought that in this
                            process the impetuousness of younger officer elements such as, for
                            example, October 17 group, would infect more conservative-minded
                            officers. Hatta opined that there were enough calm leaders (implying, in
                            my opinion, himself) to prevent any rash action, and went on to
                            emphasize that settlement of differences within officer corps very <pb
                                n="488" xml:id="pg_488" facs="0508"/>greatly enhanced army’s ability
                            to take care of Communists if force were needed.</p>
                        <p>With reference to paragraph A4 I said that I was personally somewhat
                            embarrassed that after strenuous efforts following conversations with
                            Prime Minister Ali and Defense Minister Iwa I had been able arrange
                                <gloss target="#t_MATS1">MATS</gloss> transport for Indonesian
                            officers proceeding US but that advantage had apparently not been taken
                            of this generous arrangement. I went over with him a breakdown prepared
                            by my army attaché, showing that for the Indonesian Army 90 students had
                            been allotted for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 55; 22 had accepted;
                            21 had declined; and 47 were pending. At his request I left with him on
                            plain paper a copy of this breakdown and he said he would look into the
                            matter at once to see if he could do anything about the “obvious cause
                            of the delay”. I surmise, of course, that he referred to Iwa and
                            anti-American circles around Iwa.</p>
                        <p>I mentioned the point in paragraph A2—he made no comment. With regard to
                            A7 he expressed a desire to receive full documentation on all that had
                            officially been released on the subject. I promised to try to compile
                            this for him but, in order to overlook nothing would appreciate anything
                            Department can send me.</p>
                        <p>With regard to A6 he said that despite anything I might hear to the
                            contrary it was his opinion that there was no possibility whatsoever of
                            the enactment of legislation implementing Ong’s<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d306fn2">Ong Eng Die, Minister of Finance.</note> investment
                            policy statement until the <gloss target="#t_Masjumi1">Masjumi</gloss>
                            came into power. He said that every effort made by Ong and conservative
                                <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> elements to bring such
                            legislation forward had been blocked by left-wing <gloss
                                target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss>, and he inferred the Prime Minister
                            himself, because of the wish or necessity of placating the PKI.</p>
                        <p>Re the general political scene Hatta thought <gloss target="#t_PNI1"
                                >PNI</gloss> and PKI were showing vigorous leadership and felt that
                            both were very skillful in taking the initiative. He felt that <gloss
                                target="#t_Masjumi1">Masjumi</gloss> Party organization had improved
                            and strengthened and that this had had some effect in creating a certain
                            limited dissatisfaction amongst <gloss target="#t_SOBSI1">SOBSI</gloss>
                            members with their Communist leadership. He added, a little sadly I
                            thought, that the present weakness of <gloss target="#t_Masjumi1"
                                >Masjumi</gloss> was its inability to produce a leadership as
                            vigorous as that displayed by <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> and
                            PKI which could properly guide and use the very good <gloss
                                target="#t_Masjumi1">Masjumi</gloss> Party organization in the
                            villages. He added that he hoped that the <gloss target="#t_Masjumi1"
                                >Masjumi</gloss> Party Congress tomorrow in Surabaya would produce
                            some progress in this direction.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion Hatta said that he hoped I would come to see him more often
                            here in Djakarta or at his country rest house. I tentatively suggested
                            that I had not seen more of him because I did not <pb n="489"
                                xml:id="pg_489" facs="0509"/>want to subject him to charges of too
                            close association with the American Ambassador. He said that he could
                            take care of that and that I should visit him more often. I will do
                            so.</p>
                        <p>Throughout conversation Hatta was extremely friendly and frank. He many
                            times used the expression “when <gloss target="#t_Masjumi1"
                                >Masjumi</gloss> come into power”. I felt that he is confident of a
                                <gloss target="#t_Masjumi1">Masjumi</gloss> victory but is worried,
                            as stated above, about the weakness of <gloss target="#t_Masjumi1"
                                >Masjumi</gloss> leadership in the face of vigorous <gloss
                                target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> leadership and the steady PKI
                            encroachment into and upon nationalist circles.</p>

                                influence over government; “actually it is PKI who have to make
                                adjustments to government policies”. I stressed the adverse effect
                                of government taking no action against PKI use of party symbol to
                                cover PKI and independent voters. Foreign Minister said
                                confidentially this point received prolonged consideration during a
                                special Cabinet meeting last night. Cabinet was divided upon course
                                of action to be taken but he and Prime Minister hoped authorization
                                to PKI would be revoked before “more harm was done”. He said that in
                                Central and Eastern Java PKI was definitely losing support and

                            Department’s letter of January 8, 1952 which concurred with the draft
                                letter,<note n="2" xml:id="d308fn2">Neither printed.</note> prepared
                            by the Department of Defense, to the President requesting his approval
                            of the diversion of $5 million from a special fund which was established
                            with the President’s approval in May 1951 to insure the continued pay
                            and maintenance of the Philippine Armed Forces.</p>
                        <p>Subsequent to this concurrence the American Embassy in Manila advised the
                            Department that President Elpidio Quirino had proposed that any savings,
                            roughly estimated at $1.2 million, which might be made in the Philippine
                            military budget as a result of the special $5 million American grant be
                            used to purchase loose unsurrendered firearms in the Philippines. The
                            purchase of loose firearms is an important part of the Philippine
                            Government’s pacification program. As you will recall, substantial
                            stores of arms and ammunition were abandoned by the United States Armed
                            Forces in the Philippines following the termination of hostilities
                            against Japan. Much of this equipment continues to find its way into
                            undesirable hands and to be used against the Philippine Government, not
                            only by scattered individuals, but also by the <gloss target="#t_HMB1"
                                >Huks</gloss>. The United States has consistently encouraged the
                            Philippines to remove these arms from uncontrolled circulation by any
                            means available.</p>
                        <p>The American Embassy in Manila has recommended approval of this request
                            by President Quirino and the Department concurs.</p>

                                            William S.B. Lacy, Counselor of Embassy and Deputy Chief
                                            of Mission at Manila, wrote to Philip W. Bonsal,

                                            Affairs, on the subject of land reform in the
                                            Philippines. Lacy’s letter contains the following
                                            passages:</p>
                                        <p>“On land reform I regret to report that there has been no
                                            progress at all on the main question, the redistribution
                                            of large private estates owned by absentee landlords.
                                            The President has indicated to the Ambassador that this
                                            whole subject is distasteful to him, and we have found
                                            very little support for it elsewhere in the Government.
                                            Within the last week the President has announced that
                                            the Government was abandoning its policy of purchasing
                                            private lands for resale to tenants, giving as his
                                            reason that the Government had no money with which to
                                            continue this program. The possibility that this
                                            Administration can be prevailed upon to undertake a
                                            mandatory land transfer program is more remote than
                                            ever. The setting aside of idle public lands, for sale
                                            to small homesteaders in 10-hectare plots, for payment
                                            in kind, is as far as the Government has yet shown any
                                            indication of willingness to go. By such a program,
                                            coupled with well-publicized exhortations to the Land
                                            Registration Office to expedite the issuance of titles,
                                            and to issue them without favoritism on a
                                            first-come-first-served basis, the Government is
                                            attempting to deal with and dismiss the land reform
                                            question.</p>
                                        <p>“In deference to a specific request that the Hardie
                                            Report not be disseminated, which the President made to
                                            him in the course of recent conference on defense
                                            questions, the Ambassador has not given this Report the
                                            circulation he had intended. He has provided a few
                                            copies, on individual request, to the President of the
                                            Senate, a few Senators, and other officials, and three
                                            or four were handed to local American newspaper men for
                                            their background information. Copies will continue to be
                                            given out to responsible persons asking for them. The
                                            Report has received no outside attention of Government
                                            circles, and within the Government the few individuals
                                            who have read it have tended to shy away from discussion
                                            of it. I have not heard of specific parts of the Report
                                            having been singled out as inaccurate, but as you know,
                                            neither the Embassy nor <gloss target="#t_STEM1"

                            about Jap than Phils, that US did not intend to defend Phils and that it
                            must consequently adopt a neutral position, that this clearly

                            discuss primarily econ, social and cultural coop. In first instance
                            Romulo believes this Council shld be composed only of US and those
                            Pacific states which now have security treaty relationships with it
                            namely Japan, Austral, <gloss target="#t_NZ1">NZ</gloss> and Phil. He

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: There have been exchanges
                            recently between Manila and Washington of various views as to what the
                                <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> program for the Philippines for
                            the Fiscal Year 1954 should be. Since I consider this program to have a
                            very important bearing on what we shall be able to accomplish in the
                            Philippines, I am submitting to you my ideas on the situation here, as
                            briefly as possible but still at some length.</p>
                        <p>To begin with, I think our chief reason for the Bell Mission and for our
                            present economic and military aid program here is to prevent the country
                            from falling into the hands of the Communists <pb n="498"
                                xml:id="pg_498" facs="0518"/>through the success of the <gloss
                                target="#t_HMB1">Huk</gloss> movement, and to get the country in
                            such a condition of social order and justice that there will be no
                            breeding ground left for a further Communist movement.</p>
                        <p>In fighting the spread of Communism in the Far East, we also have as a
                            most important objective the prevention of Japan from going Communist,
                            and her retention among the free nations of the world as a potential
                            ally.</p>
                        <p>To be kept out of the Communist camp, Japan must be able to trade with
                            the free nations and obtain the materials and the markets needed to
                            support her ever increasing population. Agriculturally, except possibly
                            for Hokkaido, Japan has expanded to the limit of her capabilities. She
                            can produce no more food, but must depend on imports of food and raw
                            materials. She is an industrial nation and must manufacture the raw
                            materials she imports, export and sell them abroad. If all of the free
                            countries of the Far East industrialized to the limit of their
                            capacities and failed to increase their capacity for the production of
                            food and raw materials, the result might be the forcing of Japan into
                            the arms of the Communists.</p>
                        <p>To return to the Philippine situation, I am convinced, after a seven
                            months’ period of study and observation of the country, that the basic
                            cause of the current low standard of living, underemployment and
                            unemployment among the mass of the people stems primarily from poor land
                            use. This involves a number of things, among which may be mentioned: (1)
                            lack of cadastral surveys and the inability of the small holder to
                            obtain a legal title to his land; (2) large scale absentee landlordism;
                            (3) lack of public roads to open up new areas of public lands and to
                            obtain good access to markets from areas already opened up but
                            underdeveloped; (4) adequate public health measures to combat malaria
                            and schistosomiasis in new areas of public lands and in underdeveloped
                            areas, such as Mindanao and Mindoro; (5) irrigation, particularly in
                            rice raising areas; and (6) the present incidence of taxation, which
                            falls primarily on business and consumption and so raises the cost of
                            living to the mass of the people, and which does not fall on land values
                            and so does nothing to prevent land purchase and land holding from being
                            the favorite investment of the small but wealthy class of Filipinos who
                            control the country economically and politically.</p>
                        <p>If the foregoing estimate is correct—and I feel sure that it is—, it
                            follows that our major effort should go to clearing up the basic land
                            problems and not to pushing the industrialization of the
                            Philippines.</p>
                        <p>The current political situation in the Philippines is that neither
                            Quirino or Lopez in the Liberal Party, nor Laurel or Recto in the
                            Nacionalista Party, have shown the slightest indication of taking any
                            interest in land reform. The Liberals control the House of
                            Representatives <pb n="499" xml:id="pg_499" facs="0519"/>and the
                            Nacionalistas, the Senate. Quirino’s control of his own party in the
                            House is not too firm. The result is that the chances of getting the
                            necessary laws through the Congress to effect land reform are very poor,
                                <hi rend="italic">unless we have something to give which the
                                Filipino politicians want badly and which we can and will withhold
                                if we do not get our land reform legislation</hi>. Even if we do get
                            the laws we want on the statute books, an honest and effective execution
                            of these laws still remains to be accomplished. Quirino is quite
                            obviously campaigning for re-election, and he will do nothing that he
                            feels will jeopardize his chances in this respect. The millions of

                                target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> (including <gloss target="#t_JUSMAG1"
                                >JUSMAG</gloss>) in the Philippines is about all we have to offer in
                            exchange for the laws we require for land reform and for an honest
                            execution of these laws.</p>
                        <p>I shall now discuss the question of industrialization. This may be
                            considered on the bases of (1) what industries are practicable in the
                            present state of the Philippine economy and (2) whether the United
                            States should extend a large amount of <gloss target="#t_MSA1"
                                >MSA</gloss> aid to help industrialization at the present time.</p>
                        <p>The establishment of industries which will process Philippine raw
                            materials that are now available or can be economically produced here is
                            undoubtedly sound. Examples of such industries are tobacco, cement,
                            sugar refining, rice milling, copra processing, lumber milling and the
                            processing of mineral products. A factory to manufacture bags for sugar
                            and rice is about to start production, at first using imported jute but
                            eventually to operate with Philippine-grown kenaf. This is a new Soriano
                            company, as is the glass plant which now supplies most of the Philippine
                            requirements for bottles. Colonel Soriano is also investigating the
                            possibilities of producing paper from Philippine forests.</p>
                        <p>The successful establishment of industries such as the above requires
                            careful investigation of sources of raw material, cost of plant and of
                            production, and market availability. Since the difference between
                            success and failure in such an enterprise is often narrow, the ability
                            to undertake it and to carry it through to successful operation involves
                            not only a thorough knowledge of the product, but also the selection of
                            competent management to run the industry after it is in operation. As
                            the amount of managerial talent so far developed among Filipinos is not
                            large, it follows that most of the managers of industries in the
                            Philippines will still be found to be foreigners. The national
                            corporations of the country, which are quite naturally, managed and
                            staffed by Filipinos, have not been notably successful. Much of this is
                            due to politics, however.</p>
                        <pb n="500" xml:id="pg_500" facs="0520"/>
                        <p>I turn now to the question of whether the United States should extend a
                            large amount of <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> aid to help
                            industrialization at the present time.</p>
                        <p>The present economic climate in the Philippines is not favorable to the
                            investment of foreign capital, and this includes American capital. This
                            is not only the opinion of the best qualified officers of the Embassy
                            staff, but also of nearly all of the representatives of American
                            business in the Philippines who have a real knowledge of what goes on in
                            the country. This unfavorable economic climate is evidenced by such
                            things as the import control, the foreign exchange tax, the reduction in
                            quantity or the total elimination, either by law or by executive order,
                            of the importation of specific items of trade, and, in general, the
                            heavy incidence of taxation on business enterprise previously mentioned.
                            Probably much, if not all, of the above may be expected in a newly
                            independent country; but, at the same time, it is not conducive to the
                            entry of new American capital, particularly when the capital previously
                            invested here finds itself prevented from leaving the country.</p>
                        <p>The point I am trying to make is that I do not think that the
                            substitution of public capital from the pockets of the American taxpayer
                            for industrial enterprises in the Philippines, in place of private
                            American capital, will tend to promote the favorable climate for private
                            capital which we believe should be encouraged.</p>
                        <p>A second aspect of this question is my very grave doubt as to whether the
                            investment of the American taxpayer’s money in the Philippine industry,
                            as proposed by <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> in the <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 budget, could be adequately
                            safeguarded. In this connection I refer particularly to the procedure
                            described in Musto A–63 and discussed in <gloss target="#t_MSA1"
                                >MSA</gloss>/Manila <gloss target="#t_Tomus1">Tomus</gloss> A–101 of

                            August 1952.<note n="2" xml:id="d312fn2">None printed.</note></p>
                        <p>I inquired of a representative of Colonel Soriano at the opening on 1
                            September of the Industrial Textiles Manufacturing Company, Inc., of the
                            Philippines (for the manufacture of sugar and rice bags from jute and
                            kenaf) how long Colonel Soriano had investigated the possibilities of
                            establishing this industry. I was told that he had gone into the subject
                            for a period of eight months and that in such an investigation he
                            employed officers from his own companies and outsiders as well, when
                            special talent not otherwise available was needed.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Soriano has a record for the establishing of successful new
                            industries in the Philippines, which is outstanding. On the other hand,
                            the attempts on the part of the Philippine Government, <pb n="501"

                            industrial enterprises or to operate old ones have, as a rule, been more
                            successful politically than financially.</p>

                            <item>Embassy does not believe that Romulo’s proposals would lead to

                                states. It is highly unlikely that the <gloss target="#t_SEA1"

                                attracted to an association which included Japan, Philippines, US,
                                Australia or New Zealand. As we have stated previously Embassy
                                strongly favors the development of an <gloss target="#t_SEA1"

                                    <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> agreement must be wholly
                                Asian, indigenously motivated, and must be preceded by ratification
                                of the Japanese peace treaty and recognition by the Philippines of
                                the Associated States. These steps, it appears to us, should be
                                followed by some regional grouping which would include the
                                Philippines, Thailand, Malaya and the Associated States and

                                Manila and Allison, then in Bangkok, of Ambassador Romulo’s call on
                                Secretary Acheson that same day when he complained about Philippine
                                exclusion from the five-power talks. Acheson pointed out that an
                                invitation to the Philippines would have necessitated invitations to
                                the Associated States, Burma, and Thailand, possibly endangering the
                                productivity of the conference. Romulo had been assuaged by
                                Acheson’s observation that the visit of Foster, Allison, Nash, and
                                Radford to Manila would provide a chance to review all subjects of
                                mutual interest. Romulo then indicated that he would so inform

                            be held with Quirino although general nature of problem might be
                            outlined by Radford in much same manner he did at Aug meeting <gloss

                            meeting, as I see it is to assuage fears Filipinos that matters of

                            present their views.</p>
                        <p>Agree it would serve useful purpose and remove possible local political

                            in nature of a “conference” taking place, suggest it might be useful
                            request Quirino to set up one formal meeting to which Nationalista
                            leaders be invited. At such meeting Foster and Radford could give
                            general statement re defense problems <gloss target="#t_SEA1"

                            be asked to give their ideas and express their fears. Believe one day or
                            half day spent in this fashion would have beneficial effect. Any other
                            talks Foster and party wish to have with Filipinos could be on informal
                            basis and without publicity.</p>

                            phases this problem. I suggest that on Amer side, this group should

                        <p>It was made clear to Phil leaders, particularly by Adm Radford, that

                            aggression from without, nevertheless, US could not properly fulfill

                            <item>M then asked what he should do if Laurel wanted to see him to
                                discuss M’s possible candidacy on the Nationalist ticket. To gain
                                time, I interpolated that I had heard that Recto would support him
                                if he resigned from Q’s cabinet with a blast at Q &amp; Co. M
                                appeared to receive this information with surprise and pleasure.
                                Upon M’s asking again what to do with Laurel, I advised him to thank
                                Laurel for the honor, etc., to ask to be allowed to consider the
                                proposal for a while, and to make clear to Laurel the particulars of
                                M’s program for the Philippines. This he agreed to do.</item>

                            <item>M spoke of the Liberal and Nationalist Parties in such terms as to
                                leave me under the impression that he would prefer to run on that
                                    [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] Nationalist ticket to running on
                                the Liberal slate. He said that he was making a fast friend of
                                Recto, Jr., as well as Laurel, Sr. He set no great store by a third
                                party movement, holding the machines of both parties in some
                                respect. He said Laurel liked the army but that the army distrusted
                                Laurel because of his collaborationist record; that Recto was
                                brilliant and patriotic but lacked the common touch; that the army,
                                the J. Cees, Lions &amp; Rotary Clubs would stand by him (Magsaysay)

                                said, however, that because of Laurel’s trouble with the
                                anti-Americanist label, Q had lately emphasized in Cabinet meetings
                                his desire to appear as a great friend of the U.S. M says he isn’t,

                                solved. He characterized Q &amp; Co. as “agents of the Kremlin” in

                        <p>Now, the Ambassador and I have been speculating on the reasons for this
                            remarkable visitation. The following observations seem to us pertinent
                            to any sensible conclusion: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>This Embassy has suspected, over a period of years, that the
                                    Philippine Govt’s has some fairly reliable means of determining
                                    the nature of business transacted here—whether by telegram,
                                    despatch or in conversation. We have not been able to find out
                                    if our suspicions are justified or if they are, how our friends
                                    manage it. Since the Chancery has been “cased” regularly, it
                                    occurs to us that the leakage may take place in residences or by
                                    way of indigenous personnel here in the Chancery. All this
                                    suggests the possibility that M’s visit, doubtless foreseen by
                                    Q, was in the nature of a “plant”.</item>

                            the Export-Import Bank sets forth this proposal and seeks the approval

                                >NAC</gloss> is studying the proposed credit. We are all hopeful
                            that this arrangement under which the Export-Import Bank will extend
                            small industrial loans through commercial banks will result in the
                            preponderance of loans being handled through commercial banks rather
                            than the Philippine Reconstruction Finance Corporation. This should
                            offer the greatest possible assurance that loans will be extended on a
                            commercially desirable basis.</p>
                        <p>As you were advised by the <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> telegram
                            of October 15 (Musto 437), <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> is not
                            now planning to use any of its proposed <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 54 $5 million industrialization program for loans.
                            Instead <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> is proposing to use most of
                            this amount for industrial and engineering services to enable the
                            Filipinos to evaluate and to develop commercially sound projects. In
                            this connection you may be interested in a memorandum from Mr. Renne to

                            information in Musto 437 you were able to approve the use of funds for

                            refer to “unsolved security problems which made the use of the telegraph

                                    two letters of Nov. 19, Lacy asked that Francis Cardinal
                                    Spellman, Archbishop of New York, be approached with the purpose
                                    of having him contact the Vatican in order to make known the
                                    wishes of the U.S. Government that Egidio Vagnozzi, Papal Nuncio
                                    in the Philippines, be allowed to remain in Manila at least
                                    until after the 1953 elections. Monsignor Vagnozzi informed
                                    Ambassador Spruance and Lacy that he thought Cardinal Spellman
                                    routinely forwarded to the Vatican a memorandum, emanating from
                                    President Quirino, expressing Philippine interest in Vagnozzi’s
                                    recall. Now Vagnozzi wished that Spellman be asked to indicate
                                    that he, Spellman, did not favor Vagnozzi’s recall.</p>
                                <p>In his letter, Lacy characterized Monsignor Vagnozzi as a staunch
                                    friend of the United States and a strong supporter of free
                                    elections in the Philippines. (796.00/111952)</p></note> We have

                        <p>With regard to the matter of “sanctuary” I am sure that you are aware of
                            our Government’s long term policy in this matter.<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d319fn5">In his letter of Nov. 24, Lacy said that Spruance
                                offered sanctuary to Magsaysay if he needed it, while Lacy offered
                                sanctuary for Magsaysay’s wife and children. The offers were made in
                                the light of reports from Magsaysay that President Quirino planned
                                to kill or imprison him. (796.00/11–2152; 796.00/11–2452)</note> We
                            have consistently refused to subscribe to the sort of political asylum
                            which is in vogue among some of the South American countries. Paragraph
                            225.2 of the Foreign Service Regulations entitled “Restrictions on
                            Extending Asylum” reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    asylum to persons outside of his official or personal household.
                                    Refuge may be afforded to uninvited fugitives whose lives are in
                                    imminent danger from mob violence but only for the period during
                                    which active danger continues. Refuge shall be refused to
                                    persons fleeing from legitimate agents of the local government.
                                    In case such persons have been admitted to the diplomatic or
                                    consular premises, they must be surrendered or dismissed from
                                    such mission or consular office.”</p>

                        <p>This general rule has on occasion been stretched particularly in the case
                            of persons fleeing from Communists or from excessively dictatorial
                            governments but the exceptions have been very rare.</p>

                            would be glad to have the Ambassador or yourself called back here on
                            consultation.</p>

                        <p>We fully share your reservations about Magsaysay’s arrangements with the

                                President, had assured Magsaysay of his support. Both Spruance and
                                Lacy were uneasy about this, and the Ambassador had also expressed
                                to Magsaysay his doubts about the honesty of purpose of the
                                Nacionalista leaders in supporting him or their willingness to carry
                                out Magsaysay’s program for the country. (796.00/11–2152)</note></p>

                                    <item>For some time, various leaders of the Nacionalista Party
                                        have been querying the Ambassador and Lacy about U.S.
                                        intentions regarding clean elections. At a recent
                                        get-together at Laurel’s home with Lacy in attendance, this
                                        was the main subject and was treated with much intensity.
                                        Lacy and the Ambassador have been emphatic in their
                                        statements that the U.S. will completely back clean
                                        elections and make every contribution consistent with
                                        Philippine sovereignty to this end.</item>

                                    <item>Receiving this strong answer, the Nacionalistas are
                                        convinced that clean elections are highly probable and in
                                        clean elections they could not defeat a Liberal–Quirino
                                        ticket which included Magsaysay as vice president.
                                        Therefore, their strategy is to divorce Quirino and
                                        Magsaysay and bring Magsaysay into their fold to capitalize
                                        on his immense popularity and the prospect of U.S. support,
                                        which they believe would otherwise be given the
                                        Liberal–Quirino team. In regard to this, Spruance agrees
                                        with the strategy of divorce, but also believes that the
                                        Nacionalistas may drop Magsaysay some time between now and
                                        the November elections; and without either political machine
                                        behind him, his chances for presidential election are dim.
                                        The Nacionalistas believe, moreover, that Quirino is
                                        convinced that he cannot win in a free election.</item>

                                    <item>Concerning allegations that Quirino will use martial law,
                                        jail opposition, etc., and the possibility that knowledge of
                                        the Magsaysay tie-up with the Nacionalistas would
                                        precipitate this action in the near future, Lacy believes
                                        that Quirino is capable of doing this but is reluctant
                                        unless he becomes hysterical. Lacy also advances <pb n="516"
                                            xml:id="pg_516" facs="0536"/>the theory that Quirino, in
                                        a “cornered rat” position, hemmed in by probable honest
                                        elections with U.S. backing, a poor administration record,
                                        and a strong political combine, will become sufficiently
                                        desperate and, as a result, take this irrational, reckless
                                        step. He uses as a precedent Quirino’s “surrounding the
                                        Senate with tanks and soldiers in the 1949
                                        elections”.</item>

                                    <label>a.</label>
                                    <item>It is highly probable that Quirino believes, on the basis
                                        of the history of U.S.-Philippine relations, that the U.S.
                                        will take no positive action in the event that Quirino takes
                                        this untoward act. It is most necessary that the U.S. be
                                        ready to take the strongest measures including cessation of
                                        all aid if necessary. This should be made clear to Quirino
                                        privately in the near future. The Ambassador concurs. This
                                        could be done after the situation is publicized as
                                        planned.</item>

                            working on Philippine matters for over five years I can not but help
                            suspect ulterior motives, in this case, the discrediting of Quirino as
                            far as possible. It would be a particular clever maneuver on the part of
                            the Nacionalistas, who are perfectly capable of using Magsaysay for all
                            he is worth and then discarding him when he had served his purpose. It
                            should be possible for the Embassy to check up with other sources on the
                            allegations made by Magsaysay. Mrs. Irene Murphy in <gloss

                                <item>In the 1949 elections between Quirino and Laurel, Ambassador
                                    Cowen was in favor of using all influence possible to secure the
                                    election of Quirino. There was strong disagreement within the

                                    Officer, Mr. Rice, passionately arguing for absolute neutrality.

                        <p>We must not forget that Quirino is an extremely astute politician
                            regardless of what we may think of him as a statesman. If he were
                            determined to win the November 1953 elections by hook or crook, it would
                            not be very logical for him to declare martial law in January 1953. Such
                            a declaration would simply turn over the normal civilian functions to
                            the armed forces. Quirino’s tactics instead, it would seem to me, would
                            be the following: <list>

                                    appeal would give the Liberal Party. This could be accomplished
                                    by having Magsaysay run as Vice President (with the succession

                                    Quirino can do this was illustrated by the recent special
                                    session of Congress. By failure to pass a public works bill
                                    Congress then placed itself in the position of not being able to
                                    oppose Quirino’s use of his emergency powers to allocate money
                                    for public works and relief for victims of the recent typhoons.
                                    If the Nacionalistas challenged immediately his use of the
                                    emergency powers, they would place themselves in the position of
                                    obstructing relief for typhoon victims.</item>

                            incredible. Such harsh tactics aren’t required and would certainly

                        <p>We today can be most thankful that we didn’t officially back Quirino in

                            common gossip that Lansdale was openly working for Magsaysay and Quirino
                            was “muttering” about it. Peralta blamed Lansdale for Laurel’s recent
                            challenge to Quirino that both withdraw and leave field to Magsaysay.
                            His mention of Bell not connected with Magsaysay and apparently arose
                            from fact Bell in addition good contacts with Liberals had excellent
                            contacts with and held in high regard by Nacionalista’s Party to a
                            degree that enabled him to get accurate info not generally available to
                            less active and energetic officers. (At this point I desire to emphasize

                            reflection either Lansdale or Bell, both of whom I regarded as

                            and instructions). Peralta reiterated familiar line Filipinos had done
                            everything we asked and wanted to know if we wanted them to “Do what
                            French did and tell you to take your aid and go home”. Asked if he was
                            appearing by direction of either his party or Pres Quirino, he said had
                            not discussed with President Quirino, but had with members of party who
                            agreed with him something had to be done. Alleged some of younger hot
                            heads wanted to make speeches attacking Embassy.</p>
                        <p>It is Ely’s considered opinion in which I and Lacy concur that call was
                            made with full knowledge and approval liberal hierarchy including
                            Quirino in the hope that thinly veiled threat of public attack for
                            interference domestic elections might slacken pressure for free election
                            and domestic reform. Quirino probably under considerable pressure from
                            irresponsible and difficult to control elements in his party, led by men
                            like Peralta who has been constant problem for years. Some minor attacks
                            possible but open all out attacks on US Govt as whole not likely be
                            resorted to except as last desperate resort. Such attacks might elicit
                            some support younger groups but would lose more among more conservative
                            elements. These tactics historically have been politically advantageous
                            in some instances but only when led by men in whom people had much more

                            committed to free elections in Philippines, but does not and will not
                            support any political party or candidate. Choice of political leadership
                            must be made by free votes of qualified electors expressed at polls. If
                            present govt intends to perpetuate itself by methods similar to those
                            used in 1949, which is indicated by many things that have been
                            happening, I am strongly of opinion we must at suitable time inform
                            Quirino privately that US will discontinue military and eocnomic aid if
                            he fails to ensure free election in 1953 and is re-elected by force and
                            corrupt practices. Another corrupt election will greatly strengthen
                            Communists. I consider this of such vital importance to future welfare
                            of Philippines that I plan to ask orders to return Washington to place
                            situation here before Secretary of State and President. Such request wld
                            be after new administration has shaken down and you consider time
                            propitious.</p>
                        <p>Several days ago I recommended to Lansdale that he return to US to report
                            conditions and to obtain rest and relaxation. He plans depart about
                            December 20 for three or four weeks’ stay. Lacy and I both consider his
                            return here essential in view of his personal contacts and the current
                            situation. Suggest you withhold action until his arrival.</p>

                                condition on which Magsaysay would run. Moreover, generally believed
                                that U.S., while probably favoring Magsaysay, would not give
                                sanction any campaign unless based on free elections.</p>
                            <p>“In this connection, we point out immense propaganda value to <gloss

                                in Philippines for next year must be drawn up in realization that in

                        <p>1907. No distribution. Eyes only Allison. Magsaysay called on Lacy at
                            11:30 a.m. December 30. He said Nacionalistas now proposed to nominate
                            him in convention to be called for March 1. By then he would, of course,
                            have resigned from Quirino’s Cabinet. Referring to his desire to make a
                            clean break and “get this all over” Magsaysay said that he was about to
                            suggest to Nacionalistas desirability holding convention February 1. He
                            asked Lacy’s reaction. Lacy emphasized as this Embassy has so often done
                            in the past the importance of decelerating these political developments,
                            of Magsaysay’s maintaining a free and favorable position in respect to
                            the political evolution and of Magsaysay’s continuing to emphasize
                            throughout the Philippines his determination to carry out his program
                            e.g., free elections, reforming government, land program, etc. Magsaysay
                            replied that, in any event, he would continue with increasing force to
                            prosecute his program for the welfare of the Philippines but that, as
                            far as he was concerned the die was cast with the Nacionalistas, that
                            the Liberal Party, riddled with corruption, some of its members
                            dominated by Chinese Communists and uncertain of its mission under
                            Quirino’s leadership, would never be effective instrument for
                            accomplishing reforms for Philippines requisite <pb n="526"
                                xml:id="pg_526" facs="0546"/>to stable anti-Communist society. There
                            can be no doubt whatever that Magsaysay has made up his mind to accept
                            the Nacionalistas nomination.</p>
                        <p>Lacy then suggested to Magsaysay desirability of holding Nacionalistas
                            convention March 1 instead of February 1, pointing out that Magsaysay
                            would thereby have another month to prosecute anti-<gloss
                                target="#t_HMB1">Huk</gloss> program, finish round-up Chinese
                            Communists and, importantly, remain close to army. Magsaysay replied
                            that army now entirely indoctrinated and would support him on
                            Nacionalistas ticket next fall. He said citizen organizations were
                            communicating their support to him every day.</p>
                        <p>In reply to Lacy’s questions reasons eagerness Nacionalistas to hold
                            early convention, Magsaysay replied that Recto, Laurel and others,
                            frightened by Quirino’s emerging tactic of labeling his political
                            enemies as Communists and that they realized Magsaysay’s anti-Communist
                            record provides them with <hi rend="italic">bona fides</hi> otherwise
                            unobtainable. Magsaysay dismisses scornfully any possibility that Recto
                            and Laurel have ever had any Communist inclinations.</p>
                        <p>Magsaysay then repeated desire previously expressed to visit the US
                            either as Secretary of Defense or as private citizen after resignation
                            Quirino Cabinet and designation Nacionalista candidate. Lacy said that
                            Magsaysay always welcome US but he unable of course to discuss such
                            visit in definite terms without instructions from Department. Lacy
                            pointed out that visit to US as private citizen matter of no little
                            delicacy since, as private citizen and Nacionalista candidate Magsaysay
                            would be regarded as political adversary Quirino who is Chief of State
                            and to whom US Embassy accredited. Moreover, Lacy suggested Quirino
                            might find it impossible to permit Magsaysay to go US as Secretary
                            Defense. Magsaysay asked for answer this request soonest, observing that
                            if he were well received in the US either as Secretary of Defense or
                            private citizen success his campaign for presidency assured. Lacy said
                            that if he went to US as private citizen he would have to be invited by
                            and be guest of US private citizen.<note n="1" xml:id="d326fn1"><p>The

                                    ><p>Telegram 2719, from Allison to Spruance, Mar. 5, indicated
                                    that the Department of State was reconsidering the question of
                                    Lansdale’s return to the Philippines in view of the new
                                    situation caused by Magsaysay’s resignation. The Department’s
                                    inclination was to delay Lansdale’s return at least for the
                                    present. The Embassy’s views were requested on this matter and
                                    also on Lansdale’s role in making effective a U.S. contribution
                                    toward free and fair elections in November.(796.00/3–353)</p>
                                <p>Lansdale had returned to the United States in January for
                                    discussions with civilian and military officials from whom he
                                    wished to secure approval for his plan to safeguard the
                                    integrity of the 1953 Philippine elections. No records have been
                                    found on these meetings, but see the account given in Edward G.
                                    Lansdale, <hi rend="italic">In the Midst of Wars</hi> (New York,
                                    Harper and Row, 1972), pp. 104–107.</p></note> After thorough
                            discussion of subject with six most interested and concerned it was
                            decided that Lansdale’s return here was still desirable. Direct or
                            indirect contacts with Magsaysay would be kept to absolute minimum and
                            his services for psychological warfare would continue to be made
                            available to new Secretary Defense. It was considered that Lansdale’s
                            experience as Public Information Officer would be most valuable in our
                            relations with press, including the avoidance of unwarranted attacks on
                            United States officials. I hope that his knowledge and experience will
                            be useful in promoting free elections or in warning United States if
                            other plans are being laid. If the foregoing does not work, I shall not
                            hesitate to ask that Lansdale be ordered home.<note n="2"

                        <p>2700. Embassy submits following estimate situation created by resignation
                            Magsaysay: Manila and country seething with politics. Rumors, plans,
                            charges, counter charges heard from all quarters. From this welter
                            following trends appear to be developing in opinion Embassy …, US
                            newsmen and other qualified observers.</p>
                        <p>Quirino appears to be champion Liberal Party despite admitted personal
                            unpopularity and set-backs suffered recent months. He seems determined
                            run again and his every move is calculated toward that end. However,
                            with or without his permission there are several “boomlets”, which may
                            be compounded of the aspirants ambitions as well as Quirino’s own desire
                            have back door through <pb n="529" xml:id="pg_529" facs="0549"/>which to
                            escape, using bad health as very real excuse, if he reaches conclusion
                            he cannot win. Romulo has been seriously mentioned, and according rumor
                            he has been telephone Quirino. Other names are Perez and even
                                Parades.<note n="1" xml:id="d329fn1">Senator Quintin Parades.</note>
                            Next after Quirino, Perez is believed to have best chance election, in
                            view his intimate knowledge and control party, and dossiers on party
                            members to prevent defections. Liberal convention date will presumably
                            be set soon after Nacionalista Party convention April 12.</p>
                        <p>At moment Magsaysay boom is growing, and really impressive response
                            received from all over country approving resignation, urging entrance
                            Nacionalista Party and promising support and aid. Laurel and Recto have
                            made such categorical statements supporting Magsaysay on several
                            occasions that possibility their double crossing for Laurel waning but
                            not entirely eliminated. Puyat, Delgado<note n="2" xml:id="d329fn2"
                                >Senator Francisco Delgado.</note> and Zulueta<note n="3"

                            Magsaysay but say will support any Nacionalista Party candidate named by
                            convention. Osias<note n="4" xml:id="d329fn4">Senator Camilo
                                Osias.</note> still in running for nomination and he may attempt
                            block Magsaysay entrance to Party, but his support not believed
                            widespread. Most observers opine his candidacy will need beating but not
                            regarded as really serious.</p>
                        <p>Embassy and other observers believe if elections held now Magsaysay would
                            almost certainly win, and that in long run his chances are more than
                            good. Remains to be seen whether present boom will grow and develop into
                            conflagration which will carry country with it eight months from now. In
                            view strength Liberal machine and necessity Nacionalista Party
                            maintaining initiative and impetus for long period, much hard work and
                            organizing must be done by those responsible for his campaign. As
                            Paredes told Embassy officer two weeks ago, early convention by <gloss
                                target="#t_NP1">NP</gloss> may deprive Magsaysay of ammunition too
                            early in fight, leaving Liberals chance to correct own mistakes,
                            capitalize on Nacionalista Party errors timing and judgement, and
                            perhaps pass legislation putting Liberals in strong position.</p>
                        <p>At present Magsaysay is remaining silent pending entrance Nacionalista
                            Party, presumably in few days. His friends and backers state main
                            objective now is assuring nomination, and all efforts being pointed
                            toward victory at convention April 12. Little thinking or planning has
                            been done in preparation for prolonged campaign, and lack of funds
                            causing some concern. Campaign manager not yet named, but Tanada,<note
                                n="5" xml:id="d329fn5">Senator Lorenzo Tanada.</note> Arsenio Lacson

                                Pelaez<note n="6" xml:id="d329fn6">Emmanuel Pelaez.</note> have been
                            mentioned. Opinions and desires old line members of party such as
                            Laurel, Recto will have to be considered in this connection, but this
                            cannot be done until Magsaysay well in party and assured of nomination.
                            Magsaysay himself does not appear to have any special favorites or
                            cronies, and has not surrounded himself with any particular board of
                            strategy. He will require expert advice and organizing ability among his
                            immediate entourage in order offset his relative political naiveness and
                            immaturity.</p>
                        <p>If nominated, Magsaysay’s campaign will presumably stress his youth and
                            vigor, honesty, record as defeater of <gloss target="#t_HMB1"
                                >Huks</gloss> and foe of Communist, his feeling for common man, need
                            for a change in political party as well as new, young, and fresh outlook
                            in national affairs. Campaign will also stress corruption, inefficiency
                            of Quirino administration, lack of follow up on promises to people, lack
                            of real implementation of policies recommended by Magsaysay to eradicate
                            causes of Communism by improving conditions of masses. Important factor
                            will be high regard felt for Magsaysay by US, and belief that he will be
                            able obtain continued US support; conversely, Quirino’s failure
                            accomplish many reforms promised US at time <gloss target="#t_ECA1"
                                >ECA</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> agreement will not
                            be neglected.</p>
                        <p>For their part, Liberals will probably stand on record of administration
                            since Quirino took office. He will claim credit for eliminating <gloss
                                target="#t_HMB1">Huks</gloss>, opening lands to the landless,
                            enhancing economic prosperity of country, obtaining $252 million in
                                <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> aid from US, enhancing
                            international stature of Philippines, and otherwise for doing everything
                            possible to bring country along following devastation of war. Moreover,
                            Liberals will attack Magsaysay for ingratitude toward Quirino, who made
                            him; for political opportunism and for being over ambitious; for being
                            young, impetuous and without experience; for diverting armed forces
                            funds for <gloss target="#t_EDCOR1">EDCOR</gloss> and similar projects
                            allegedly designed to further political ambitions; for accepting at
                            least one bribe in connection with a Chinese deportation case.</p>
                        <p>The campaign will undoubtedly be tough and dirty, with no holds barred.
                            Despite Quirino’s admonitions to the Army March 4 to stay out of
                            politics, and promises for clean elections announced simultaneously,
                            possibilities for coercive action and fraud still strong. Strong rumor
                            that Governor Osmena of Cebu will be appointed Secretary of Defense in
                            some sort of deal involving his arch rival Cuenco. This move, despite
                            Osmena’s personal friendship with Magsaysay, regarded with distrust in
                            view unsavory reputation both Osmena and Cuenco and their willingness
                            achieve political <pb n="531" xml:id="pg_531" facs="0551"/>ambitions by
                            any means. Also freely rumored that Governor Lacson of Negros Oriental
                            will be reinstated; this would be interpreted by Embassy that Quirino
                            determined to stop at nothing to ensure re-election.</p>
                        <p>As stated at outset hereof, Embassy and others believe main outlines of
                            political situation to be as above. It will be important for Embassy and
                            US people generally to refrain from taking sides in any way. We should
                            at every opportunity assert our neutrality and express hope that come
                            what may the elections in the Philippines will be free and honest, and
                            devoid of coercion or fraud.</p>

                                <p>“Department most pleased at press reports [see the <hi

                                    Ambassador warned Americans living in Philippines to refrain
                                    scrupulously from taking part in coming Presidential campaign.
                                    Department completely agrees that Philippine politics are
                                    exclusive concern of Philippine people and that Americans
                                    residing in Philippines should maintain same attitude of strict
                                    non-involvement observed by their Government.</p>
                                <p>“US Government is confident that observance of fundamental

                        <p>2981. No distribution. Eyes only Allison. Elizalde asked Lacy visit him
                            at his apartment early a.m., April 1. Elizalde opened conversation by
                            characterizing present situation Philippines as “very bad but I hope not
                            irreparable”. He then went on to draw parallel between present situation
                            and that which characterized conflict and long deadlock between Quezon
                            and General Wood.<note n="1" xml:id="d331fn1">Gen. Leonard Wood,
                                Governor-General of the Philippines, 1921–1927, at which time Manuel
                                Quezon was President of the Philippine Senate. The constitutional
                                issue involved in their dispute centered around General Wood’s right
                                to veto legislation and, subsequently, his administration of the
                                government without consultation with Philippine officials.</note> He
                            said that as was true in Wood’s case and as he had advised Quirino the
                            more Spruance was subjected to attacks of the sort projected during last
                            few days the more difficult it would be for Quirino to “get rid of
                            Spruance” since he, Elizalde, realized that the US Government would be
                            most reluctant to recall Spruance while under fire of this nature. He
                            said that he had told Quirino that Spruance occupied remarkably high
                            position in the esteem of his countrymen who considered that Spruance
                            “could do no wrong”. He said that Quirino, up to the present, at least,
                            had remained unconvinced of the validity of this proposition.</p>
                        <p>Elizalde said that during recent weeks he had almost concluded that
                            Quirino was “mentally unbalanced”, since he seemed to project himself
                            irrationally into situations from which extrication seemed almost
                            impossible.</p>
                        <p>Lacy expressed gratification that Elizalde had had wit and courage to
                            suggest to Quirino folly of hoping to get rid of Spruance through
                            attacks of sort which have appeared in press here during <pb n="533"
                                xml:id="pg_533" facs="0553"/>last four days. He went on to emphasize
                            Ambassador’s desire to observe strict neutrality in present political
                            struggle a desire shared by Embassy staff. Lacy told Elizalde in strict
                            confidence that it had been suggested that text of President
                            Eisenhower’s letter to Quirino be published by Embassy but that
                            Ambassador and staff had decided not to do so. Elizalde, with great
                            emotion, said publication of letter would exacerbate present situation
                            immeasurably and expressed gratitude that Embassy had seen fit to keep
                            letter unpublished.<note n="2" xml:id="d331fn2">Reference is to a letter
                                of Mar. 16 from President Eisenhower responding to one of 9 days
                                earlier from Quirino. Eisenhower’s letter said that the United
                                States was ready and willing to consider any proposals from the
                                Philippines for revision of the Trade Agreement and suggested that
                                they be given to Ambassador Spruance to facilitate study by U.S.
                                authorities who would determine if they provided a basis for
                                renegotiation of the Agreement. Both letters are printed in

                        <p>Lacy told Elizalde that primary mission US Embassy Philippines was to
                            promote and maintain good relations with Philippine Government and that
                            Ambassador, Lacy and other members of staff stood ready to consult with
                            him or other members of Philippine Government at any hour of night or
                            day to end that that mission be achieved. Elizalde, suggesting that
                            Quirino–Spruance relations at present strained to breaking point, asked
                            Lacy to consult with him on short notice and frequently. Lacy of course
                            agreed, stating that he was sure Ambassador Spruance would welcome such
                            association. Lacy then asked Elizalde what he thought could be done at
                            moment to apply necessary sedation to situation. Elizalde instantly
                            replied that both sides must be absolutely quiet. Lacy agreed that this
                            simple course of action highly desirable and said that Elizalde could
                            count upon the absolute silence and complete neutrality of US
                            Government. Elizalde said that he thought State Department’s release

                            1. Elizalde replied that he had only glanced at it. Lacy then showed him

                                <p>“The Quirino–US Embassy imbroglio took on a new angle today as

                        <p>Lacy said that he had been warned previous day that Perez was about to
                            commence attack on him and wondered if Elizalde could advise on this
                            matter. Visibly perturbed, Elizalde asked Lacy “for God’s sake, say
                            nothing whatever they say about you”. Lacy agreed. Elizalde took sudden
                            leave of Lacy saying that he must immediately find President which he
                            would do “if I have to follow him to Baguio in an airplane”.</p>
                        <p>Embassy believes Elizalde’s perturbation due to fact that, when he called
                            Lacy, he thought he could offer some disciplined forebearance on Liberal
                            side, but learning of what appears to be beginning Perez attack on Lacy
                            realized Quirino either had not or could not discipline Perez. As he
                            said goodbye Elizalde characterized Perez in colorful and
                            uncomplimentary terms adding that San Francisco’s <gloss
                                target="#t_ConGen1">ConGen</gloss> Pidlaon was Perez’s creature. As
                            Department knows it is reliably reported that Elizalde told Quirino he
                            would resign unless Pidlaon was fired.</p>
                        <p>Elizalde obviously in highly nervous state. His physician left him as
                            Lacy arrived. Elizalde told Lacy that his blood pressure was several
                            thousand times as high as it should be.</p>
                        <p>I agree with Lacy as to seriousness of present situation, and have
                            admonished my staff to maintain silence and neutrality at all times. I
                            trust Department will do likewise. Since conversation between Elizalde
                            and Lacy was of highly personal character I hope Department will give it
                            maximum protection.<note n="5" xml:id="d331fn5">On the following day,
                                Apr. 2, Lacy wrote to Assistant Secretary Allison supplying further
                                information which, he said, could not for obvious reasons be
                                included in telegram 2981. He indicated that Elizalde had confided
                                to him that Ambassador Spruance was not the man for the job in
                                Manila because of his inflexibility and unwillingness to listen to
                                warnings about the coming crisis between the administration and the
                                Embassy over the elections. Elizalde went on to say that Ambassador
                                Spruance obviously wanted Magsaysay to win in November, which was
                                perhaps understandable, but his mistake lay in never having been
                                subtle about his desire. (<gloss target="#t_PSA1">PSA</gloss> files,

                            and our relationship to it, but also because I realize that you have
                            been at pains therein to pass to me certain views, which you perhaps
                            believe I will find it difficult to accept, in the most palatable way

                            the conclusion that, as a practical matter, such differences as may

                            role we should play in it, minor in any case, are of no particular

                                President Quirino. During a discussion on May 7 with the two

                                relations, not including the elections, Quirino appeared
                                conciliatory. Part of his dislike for Spruance seemed to stem from
                                his belief that the latter had snubbed him by not inviting him to
                                dinner. Spruance informed the President that he had tried to do so
                                during the previous summer through the Foreign Ministry but had been
                                told that Quirino could not accept invitations from chiefs of
                                diplomatic missions. The President expressed astonishment, and the
                                Ambassador indicated that he would be happy to have him as a guest

                            appreciates US motives, shares conviction that, regardless of outcome,

                        <p>The President cordially greeted Mr. Romulo and said “Carlos, I understand
                            you are going into politics, too”.<note n="1" xml:id="d334fn1">During
                                the previous month, Carlos Romulo had decided to run for the
                                Philippine Presidency as the candidate of the Democratic Party.
                                Prior to the election, he in effect gave up the race and supported
                                Magsaysay against Quirino.</note></p>
                        <p>Romulo proceeded to express his concern over honest elections in the
                            Philippines and his hope that arms and munitions supplied by the United
                            States would not be used to carry out a fraudulent election in the
                            Philippines. The President said that the objective of this Government
                            was to have good, friendly governments throughout the world whose
                            representatives were elected by their own processes, that the United
                            States had no intention of doing anything that could be construed as
                            interference in the affairs of these governments, that the Philippines
                            was no exception, and that he was instructing his Government
                            accordingly.</p>
                        <p>The President then asked what the differences were between the political
                            parties. Romulo stated that the Nacionalistas, as the name implied, were
                            very nationalistic in their outlook and that this was the party of
                            Laurel and Recto, who had stepped aside to make room for Magsaysay. The
                            President said he understood Magsaysay was an honest, straightforward
                            man. Romulo remarked that the big drawback to Magsaysay was his lack of
                            background and experience. He added that at a recent press conference
                            Magsaysay was unable to explain the difference between “balance of
                            trade” and the “Trade Agreement”.</p>
                        <p>The President emphasized that the United States was not taking sides in
                            the election and could not even use indirect pressures such as the
                            threat to cut military aid. The President said that even though he might
                            feel favorably inclined towards one candidate because of past
                            friendships he would never permit himself to be quoted as favoring any
                            candidate.</p>

                        <p>Romulo said that President Quirino was arriving this morning for medical
                            treatment and would try to run the government from his bedside at Johns
                            Hopkins. Romulo emphasized his concern that Quirino while he was here
                            would try to get the United States involved in a joint commission to
                            consider the Trade Agreement and that he hoped the matter could be
                            deferred until after the elections.<note n="2" xml:id="d334fn2"><p>In a
                                    letter of July 10 Thruston B. Morton, Assistant Secretary of
                                    State for Congressional Relations, informed H. Alexander Smith,
                                    Chairman of the Sub-Committee on Far Eastern Affairs of the
                                    Senate Foreign Relations Committee, of the latest developments
                                    in U.S.-Philippine trade matters. On May 5, the Philippine
                                    Government officially requested establishment of a joint
                                    committee to study and recommend a definite form of readjustment
                                    of trade relations and submitted its own proposals to be used as
                                    a basis for such study. On July 1, the United States responded
                                    by suggesting, instead of the formation of a joint committee,
                                    that the Philippine proposals be referred to a U.S. special
                                    executive commission for study.</p>
                                <p>Morton’s letter also contained the following paragraph:</p>

                                    the Trade Agreement the Department has firmly opposed this
                                    proposal. Objection to it has been made on the ground that the
                                    Philippines, not the United States, was asking for changes, and
                                    since the Philippines is now an independent country, it should
                                    request the specific changes it desired which would then be
                                    given consideration by the United States. For your confidential
                                    information, the Department’s decision against a joint committee
                                    approach in handling the Philippine request for revision was
                                    prompted also by certain political considerations. The
                                    Department is of the opinion that the Philippine proposal for a
                                    joint committee is a political move to transfer to the United
                                    States the responsibility for the disappointments to important
                                    Philippine business interests that will inevitably result from
                                    any kind of revision involving selected free trade, which is one
                                    of the major Philippine proposals. Any such revision would favor
                                    the business interests of some politically important Filipinos
                                    over the interests of others equally important; this might have
                                    unfavorable political repercussions.”
                                (411.9631/7–1053)</p></note> The President stated he was not too
                            familiar with this matter but that we were doing all possible to avoid
                            getting involved in the elections.</p>
                        <p>On the way out several newspapermen asked Romulo what had transpired. He
                            said that he could not talk about the interview but that he did have a
                            prepared statement, which he presented to them. The statement began “I
                            have not come here to air our dirty political linen at home.” Mr.
                            Wanamaker pointed out that this call was the regular protocol call a
                            retiring ambassador pays on the President and which Romulo had not had
                            an opportunity to make prior to his departure for Manila.</p>

                        <p>The Philippines is currently in the throes of a Presidential election
                            campaign. The contenders are (1) Elpidio Quirino of the Liberal Party,
                            the present incumbent, who, under the Constitution, can remain in office
                            only until April 1956, if re-elected, (2) Ramon Magsaysay, former
                            Secretary of Defense under Quirino and now candidate of the Nacionalista
                            Party, and (3) Carlos Romulo, former Foreign Minister under Quirino, who
                            with his supporters broke from the Liberal Party at the Convention that
                            renominated Quirino and established a third party called the Democratic
                            Party. Rumors of a recurrence of the violence and dishonesty
                            characteristic of the Presidential election four years ago have given
                            the forthcoming elections the character of a test of representative
                            government in the Philippines. The United States is using its influence
                            in support of free and honest elections, scrupulously avoiding
                            attempting to influence their outcome. Attempts to involve the U.S.
                            Embassy and other agencies in the Philippines in local politics have,
                            however, been a feature of the election. The Liberal Party in particular
                            has accused the U.S. representatives of seeking to bring about the
                            election of Magsaysay.</p>
                        <p>Despite the visit of two Japanese Missions to Manila in the past year,
                            the issue of Japanese reparations to the Philippines remains unsettled
                            and the Nacionalistas have blocked ratification of the Japanese Peace
                            Treaty.</p>
                        <p>The campaign against the Communist-led <gloss target="#t_HMB1"
                                >Huks</gloss> has improved steadily in the past two years, thanks
                            largely to Magsaysay and the joint U. S. Military Advisory Group.</p>
                        <p>Of $77 million in economic aid planned for Fiscal Years 1951–53,
                            expenditures as of March 31, 1953 totaled $30.2 million. It is planned
                            to reduce the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953 program to $20
                            million and the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 program to $17
                            million. Of $115 million <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss>
                            assistance planned for Fiscal Years 1950–53, over $46 million worth of
                            equipment had been delivered as of February 1953.</p>

                        <p>The positions to be filled are the presidency, the vice presidency, eight
                            of the twenty-four seats in the Senate, and all the 102 seats in the
                            House. President Quirino, according to the Constitution, can remain in
                            office, even if he should be re-elected in November, only eight
                            consecutive years, e.g. until April 15, 1956. Until the end of 1952 it
                            was commonly believed that Secretary of Defense Ramon Magsaysay would be
                            Quirino’s running mate on the Liberal ticket, but increasingly strained
                            relations culminated in Magsaysay’s resignation from his cabinet post on
                            February 28, 1953, and his issuance of a press statement that he could
                            no longer continue in an administration which wanted him only to kill
                                <gloss target="#t_HMB1">Huks</gloss> and continued to tolerate
                            conditions which offered a fertile soil for communism. Nine days later
                            Magsaysay announced his formal adherence to the Nacionalista Party and
                            early in April, with the support of Senators Laurel and Recto, received
                            the Nacionalista presidential nomination.</p>
                        <p>On May 24, 1953, the Liberal Party, in a convention characterized by
                            dubious parliamentary tactics, nominated President Quirino as its
                            candidate for the presidency. Supporters of the candidacy of Carlos P.
                            Romulo, until recently Ambassador to the United States, walked out of
                            the convention after they were unable to obtain secret balloting. Romulo
                            has now announced the formation of a third party and has secured the
                            support of several prominent <pb n="541" xml:id="pg_541" facs="0561"
                            />figures such as Vice President Lopez and former Governor Lacson of
                            Negros Occidental. In determining whether to continue with the third
                            party or to throw his support behind Magsaysay, Romulo will be paying
                            close attention to Quirino’s health. If the combination of gout and
                            heart trouble should prove fatal, a new Liberal Party Convention would
                            have to be held to choose a new candidate.</p>
                        <p>Recent actions by Liberal Party leaders indicate that President Quirino
                            may be preparing to use the same methods he employed in 1949 when he
                            defeated Jose Laurel, the Nacionalista candidate, in an election
                            notorious for fraud and coercion. Quirino has already attacked
                            opposition leaders for failure to pay income taxes and for alleged
                            Communist sympathies. The Liberal Party has been charged with collecting
                            campaign funds by extortion from Chinese, often as the price for release
                            from detention for alleged Communist activities, and also from
                            businessmen by making the issuance of import licenses contingent upon
                            contributions to the Party. The constabulary, which was used in 1949 to
                            help elect Quirino and which in 1951 was placed under army control at
                            the suggestion of the Joint U.S. Military Advisory Group (<gloss
                                target="#t_JUSMAG1">JUSMAG</gloss>), has in some areas recently been
                            removed from direct control of provincial army commanders.</p>
                        <p>The United States is convinced of the necessity of free and honest
                            elections in the Philippines and is using its influence to that end
                            rather than to advance the fortune of any candidate, recognizing that
                            any attempt to influence the elections would be bound to become public
                            knowledge and would be prejudicial to our own best interests. Through
                            statements to the press, conversations with individuals, and material
                            distributed through USIE; by support or such non-partisan organizations
                            as the League of Women Voters and the National Movement for Free
                            Elections (<gloss target="#t_NAMFREL1">NAMFREL</gloss>); and by not
                            discouraging speculation as to whether the United States would
                            discontinue military and economic aid in the event of dishonest
                            elections. Ambassador Spruance and his staff are emphasizing the
                            importance of the continuation of the democratic tradition in the
                            Philippines. They have determined that the close relationship
                            established with Magsaysay in his capacity of Secretary of Defense shall
                            give way to a formal, neutral, correct attitude toward Magsaysay the
                            candidate.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy and other United States Government agencies in the
                            Philippines cannot, however, expect to remain immune from attempts to
                            involve them in local politics. In fact, such attempts—chiefly
                            exemplified by accusations of the Liberal Party that United States
                            representatives are working for the success of the Nacionalistas—have
                            been a feature of the Philippine political scene since the autumn of
                            1952.</p>
                        <pb n="542" xml:id="pg_542" facs="0562"/>
                        <p>The differences between the parties on basic issues are slight. Despite
                            their platform promises of reform and progress, Nacionalista leaders,
                            like those of the Liberal Party, have no specific program designed to
                            cope with the country’s major problems. Their interest lies almost
                            wholly in ousting Quirino. Although Magsaysay believes that social
                            reform, particularly with respect to land tenure, is essential for the
                            maintenance of peace and order, it is doubtful that if elected president
                            he could institute any very drastic measures since these would by their
                            very nature run counter to what most members of the Congress consider
                            their personal interests. Regardless of the outcome of the 1953
                            elections, few major changes can be expected in domestic policies.</p>

                        <p>During the past year two Japanese missions have visited Manila for the
                            purpose of discussing reparations. Although Liberal Party leaders have

                            attention on the necessity of resolving in an expeditious manner certain
                            property questions and related matters arising from the Military Bases

                        <p>Originally planned economic aid programs for fiscal year 1951 through
                            1953 amounted to $77 million. Of this amount, expenditures as of March
                            31, 1953, totaled $30.2 million. The inability of the Philippines to
                            utilize funds available has been due in part to detailed planning
                            necessitated by the nature of a project program requiring review and
                            approval by relatively inexperienced Philippine officials. It has become
                            apparent that a five-year program of $250 million as envisaged by the
                            Bell Mission is beyond the capacity of the Philippines to absorb and
                            that a program based on smaller yearly expenditures over a longer period
                            of time is more realistic. Consequently, it is planned to reduce the
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953 program to the level of $20

                            appears, however, that there will <pb n="544" xml:id="pg_544"

                            1953, with total government expenditures estimated at $354 million.</p>
                        <p>Exports, $254 million in calendar year 1949, reached a peak of $499
                            million in 1951, reflecting post-Korea price increases for Philippine
                            agricultural products, and declined to $352 million in 1952. Imports
                            have been reduced from a post-war peak of $657 million in 1949 to about
                            $425 million in 1952. The unfavorable balance of trade of $72 million in
                            1952 is more than offset by United States Government expenditures
                            (including benefits to veterans) of $134 million. The international
                            reserve (Central Bank and private banks) of over $300 million is
                            considered adequate.</p>
                        <p>The production of Philippine staple crops continues to improve. Sugar
                            production in 1952 amounted to over one million short tons as against
                            less than 800,000 in 1951. The 1952–53 rice crop, expected to be the
                            largest in Philippine history, is such that imports may be
                            unnecessary.</p>

                            law greatly strengthening the rights of unions but at the same time
                            defining their obligations.</p>

                        <p>Quirino said that one of ten possible items of discussion at this time
                            would be question of payment of increases in Philippine Armed Forces pay
                            rates ordered by Osmena in 1944. He said General MacArthur had approved
                            Osmena’s order. Bonsal stated that he was not familiar with this
                            specific issue but that he believed all matters of this nature had been
                            thoroughly explored and equitably settled in the past. He said, however,
                            that if the Filipinos cared to raise any new issues through normal
                            diplomatic channels we would give them usual prompt and thorough
                            consideration.</p>

                            discuss these issues with appropriate American officials next week. If
                            Castelo, who has not yet approached us, proposes discuss <pb n="546"
                                xml:id="pg_546" facs="0566"/>these matters, it will be suggested
                            that issues fully documented be presented through normal diplomatic

                            discussions with Castelo warranted.</p>
                        <p>In discussing forthcoming elections, Quirino said that they would be
                            conducted in accordance with democratic principles. He referred to 1951
                            elections as model and added he would not jeopardize honorable record
                            his forty years public service just to serve another two years as
                            President. Bonsal expressed satisfaction this statement and stressed
                            importance attached here this question. Quirino attacked Laurel for

                                            >AFP</gloss> would switch allegiance to Magsaysay. This
                                        is not quite true. A number of military men would stick to
                                        Quirino, with their men—although there is strong likelihood
                                        that most of the <gloss target="#t_AFP1">AFP</gloss> men in
                                        the initial Quirino force would soon defect to Magsaysay
                                        when the shooting started. Thus, the top Liberal command,
                                        through Antonio Quirino (who was put on active duty as a
                                        Lieutenant Colonel with the Chief of Staff), is reportedly
                                        arming civilians with political allegiance to the Liberal
                                        machine in the provinces. Magsaysay states that the General
                                        Staff has informed him that Duque ordered a fresh
                                        distribution of firearms to civilian commandos and that
                                        17,000 arms have been distributed in the past 3 months.
                                        Magsaysay estimates that he distributed 14,000 firearms to
                                        civilian commando units to fight the <gloss target="#t_HMB1"

                                        with some success, but not entirely. We are up against the
                                        age-old problem of trying to fight an uninhibited,

                                        by law. It is always easier to shoot a man you feel certain

                                    <item>Pressures applied on Quirino via the U.S. Embassy and the
                                        U.S. press might well cause Quirino to undertake an
                                        anti-U.S. campaign. President Quezon did so, in the past,
                                        and was popular. If permitted to be unchecked, such a
                                        campaign could gain a popular following for Quirino as the
                                        underdog fighting a U.S. pictured as a bully, or at its

                                    <item>Filipino reactions must be watched closely. However, the
                                        main actions to overcome an unfavorable reaction are simple:
                                        to get Filipinos to see Quirino as a bad actor, and to laugh
                                        at him. These actions are being planned and will be

                                        already started, by themselves. The most biting action is
                                        being sponsored by Yabut, radio disc-jockey with an immense
                                        provincial following. His latest vehicle of attack is a song
                                        patterned after that used by Filipino beggars: President
                                        Quirino do not eat too much more or you will burst, we are
                                        hungry and starving, my family does not have work, the whole
                                        nation is miserable, we beg you to retire so our nation may
                                        live. This song is bringing a sort of embarrassed giggle
                                        throughout the provinces; it will soon turn to open laughter
                                        as people become used to the idea of ridiculing their

                            your letter of September 16<note n="2" xml:id="d339fn2">Not
                                printed.</note> in which you welcome my proposal to send a mission
                            to the Philippines to discuss with a similar body appointed by Your
                            Excellency the expansion and development of certain bases and other
                            outstanding property and related questions. I have instructed <pb
                                n="553" xml:id="pg_553" facs="0573"/>the Secretary of State to
                            communicate further with your Government, through the normal diplomatic
                            channels, regarding the matters related to the defense of the
                            Philippines that might properly be considered by our respective
                            missions.</p>
                        <p>It is my hope that the conversations between our respective missions will
                            lead to an agreement which will enable both our Governments to proceed
                            with the fulfillment of the obligations assumed under the Mutual Defense
                            Treaty. As you are aware, developments in the Far East in recent years
                            make it imperative that we proceed without delaying to an agreement
                            which will permit expansion and development of certain bases. I am
                            confident that Your Excellency would not wish any matter extraneous to
                            the urgent need for implementing our mutual defense to be allowed to
                            jeopardize or delay agreement on the bases question. For these reasons,
                            I am sure you will agree with me that enlargement of the scope of the
                            proposed discussions to include claims arising from the last war is not
                            desirable.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the claims arising out of organizational and other
                            arrangements effected during the last world war concerning military
                            personnel, I desire to point out that, during the eight years that have
                            elapsed since the termination of hostilities, the United States
                            Government has given careful and thorough consideration to all
                            Philippine claims presented within the generous time limits allowed. The
                            guerrilla recognition program was terminated on June 30, 1948. In a
                            letter to the Department of State on April 21, 1949, the Secretary of
                            the Army stated: “The Department of the Army considers that the
                            recognition program has been properly terminated and that recognition
                            claims have been accorded due and careful consideration in all cases.”
                            This position was communicated to the Philippine Embassy in Washington
                            on May 11, 1949, together with a copy of the April 21 letter from the
                            Secretary of the Army.<note n="3" xml:id="d339fn3">Not

                            during the last war. In a note dated June 28, 1951,<note n="4"

                            notified the Philippine Embassy at Washington that an extensive period
                            of time had been provided for presentation of such claims, that these
                            claims had been given due consideration and that the subject was
                            considered closed.</p>
                        <p>In view of the general thorough consideration given to claims presented

                            Government can now or in the foreseeable future give favorable
                            consideration to a reexamination of these claims and I must express my
                            firm conviction that further discussion, arousing as it will vain hopes
                            among so many, would not be in the true interests of our two
                            Governments.</p>

                                Philippine domestic affairs by Mr. Bell.<note n="1" xml:id="d340fn1"
                                    >On Nov. 3, Elizalde issued a lengthy statement charging the
                                    United States with interference in the Philippine elections. His
                                    statement was made partly in response to remarks made by Bell on
                                    Oct. 8 in a speech before the Philippine session of the
                                    Conference of the Far East-American Council of Commerce and
                                    Industry at New York; text is printed in Department of State <hi

                                    of the Philippine Division, who was Political Secretary in the
                                    American Embassy in Manila under Ambassador Spruance up to a few
                                    months ago, came out with a declaration in a public address that
                                    ‘Absolute impartiality with respect to internal partisan
                                    politics has been our policy, is our policy and will continue to
                                    be our policy’ but in the same breath, he added that ‘Yet as one
                                    of our main objectives is political stability, we cannot deny
                                    that we are concerned that the democratic processes function so
                                    that the people may freely express their will.’”</p>

                        <p>Secretary Elizalde in subsequent paragraphs charged that this statement
                            by implication accuses President Quirino and his administration of
                            subverting the democratic ballot, constitutes meddling in the Philippine
                            elections, is an indictment of the officers charged with the duty of
                            safeguarding the sanctity of the ballot, lends aid and comfort to the
                            opposition candidate, tends to undermine the faith of the Philippine
                            people in their ability and determination of the Philippine Government
                            to execute the laws faithfully and impartially, is a lack of regard for
                            Philippine sovereignty, reflects on the will of the Philippine people to
                            hold an honest election, is an expression of doubt that there will be a
                            free election, may lead to serious post-election problems and
                            demonstrates that the issue of American intervention in Philippine
                            elections is not a false issue.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Elizalde failed to point out that immediately following the
                            statement he quoted, I said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“We are confident, on the basis of statements from Philippine
                                    leaders, that the elections will be conducted in such a way as
                                    to prove a blow to the aspirations of international communism
                                    and will advance the cause of the Free World in the Far
                                    East.”</p>

                        <p>This address was written early in October and delivered on October 8,
                            before the presidential campaign in the Philippines had reached its
                            present high emotional pitch. The Embassy had announced a policy of
                            complete non-intervention and refusal to comment on charges of American
                            intervention as early as April 1953. Officers of the American Embassy at
                            Manila, including the Ambassador, had stated privately on many occasions
                            to Philippine leaders our concern with the conduct of the coming
                            elections. It was the opinion of <gloss target="#t_PSA1">PSA</gloss> at
                            the time I made my address in New York that an official expression of
                            this view was desirable. President Quirino’s insinuations of American
                            interference in the Philippine election had not at this time reached the
                            pitch that they did subsequently. My statement was the first and until
                            November 6 the only <pb n="556" xml:id="pg_556" facs="0576"/>official
                            statement of our concern.<note n="2" xml:id="d340fn2">On Nov. 6,
                                President Eisenhower released the text of a letter which he had sent
                                on that date to Myron M. Cowen, former Ambassador to the
                                Philippines, in response to a letter from Cowen of Oct. 27
                                concerning the elections. The President expressed his conviction
                                that the Philippine people would meet this vital test of their
                                democracy in a manner reflecting pride on themselves and on the
                                American people who had worked long for Philippine independence. The
                                text of Eisenhower’s letter is in <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of
                                    the Presidents of the United States: Dwight D. Eisenhower,

                            publicity in the United States except for a very small item buried in a
                                <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> story, it appeared on the
                            front page of several Manila newspapers on October 9. I am attaching a

                        <p>I believe that in a sense there is some merit to Secretary Elizalde’s
                            contention that by expressing concern over the conduct of the elections
                            we are meddling in Philippine domestic affairs. However, at the time I
                            made this statement <gloss target="#t_PSA1">PSA</gloss> believed that an
                            expression of our position was desirable. The circumstances prevailing
                            then were considerably different from the circumstances prevailing now,
                            particularly in view of Quirino’s oblique attacks on us and the fact
                            that our position has been stated once and that the principal effect of
                            reiteration would be to antagonize some members of the present
                            Philippine administration.</p>

                                the forepart of October, he reported his concern over the fact that
                                Magsaysay and certain of his supporters were talking quite freely
                                about the possibility of an armed insurrection in the event the
                                elections were to be lost as a result of fraud and intimidation on
                                the part of Quirino and his supporters. This problem was the subject
                                of several discussions which were participated in by Ambassador
                                Spruance and representatives of the Department of State …<note n="1"

                                    indicated that Magsaysay and some of his close supporters for
                                    his candidacy as President of the Philippines were planning for
                                    the possibility of armed revolt in the event that President

                                    violence. Some of the reports indicated that certain of the more
                                    irresponsible of Magsaysay’s supporters, including Senator
                                    Laurel, were actually making physical preparations for such

                                conspicuous fraud and violence. The Ambassador had agreed to meet

                            <item>On 8 November … reported that the meeting had been held … with
                                Magsaysay, Senator Puyat, Ambassador Spruance, Counselor of the
                                Embassy Lacy … in attendance. The report stated that Magsaysay gave
                                firm assurances that he would take no armed action and that he was
                                able to control all his partisans in this matter. He went on to say
                                that if Quirino received an apparent plurality of the vote through
                                massive fraud and terrorism, he was confident the Nacionalistas
                                could gain majority support in Congress to prevent the confirmation
                                of Quirino and to declare Magsaysay President. Magsaysay said he
                                would then promptly relieve General Duque as Chief of Staff and
                                appoint General Vargas in his place. Magsaysay hoped that with such
                                Congressional and Army backing he could establish a stable
                                government, meeting the requirements for United States recognition,
                                which would be needed as soon as possible.</item>

                            <p>The victory of Ramon Magsaysay and the Nacionalista party in the
                                Philippine elections is not expected to lead to any major shift in
                                Philippine domestic or foreign policy. Magsaysay was supported by a
                                wide range of persons representing disparate points of view. He
                                obtained the nomination under terms of an agreement signed <pb

                                    <label>1.</label>
                                    <item><p>The older leaders of the Nacionalista Party,
                                            principally Senators Recto, Laurel and Rodriguez, who
                                            have had many years’ experience in the Philippine
                                            political arena and who also enjoy widespread personal
                                            influence. Recto is the most brilliant lawyer in the
                                            Philippines, the greatest master of the English language
                                            in public life in the Philippines, and a man of
                                            integrity. The fact that he and Laurel served as
                                            Secretary of Foreign Affairs and President respectively
                                            during the Japanese occupation is of no political
                                            significance in the Philippines today. Political
                                            developments since the War have demonstrated that the
                                            Filipino people are convinced that Laurel and Recto
                                            acted in their best interests during the occupation.
                                            Laurel is an aesthete, almost something of a mystic,
                                            probably an alcoholic, and astute politician and almost
                                            devoid of any knowledge of or interest in economics.
                                            Although Laurel has captured the imagination and
                                            affection of many Philippine peasants and workers, it is
                                            unlikely that he would advocate any radical reform
                                            measures. Recto is wealthy; Laurel less so. In general,
                                            they represent the views of the conservative land-owning
                                            class, although Laurel might assume a somewhat more
                                            progressive attitude than Recto. These two men will
                                            almost certainly dominate the Philippine Senate for the
                                            next four years. Senate President Rodriguez, respected
                                            as “an elder statesman”, is in fact less influential
                                            than either Recto or Laurel. Some younger politicians
                                            regard him as senile.</p>
                                        <p>Because of the control of the Philippine Senate by
                                            representatives of this element it is likely that they
                                            will exert a very considerable influence in the new
                                            administration.</p></item>

                                    <item><p>The relatively younger, more militant, Catholic
                                            Progressive element, in part under the leadership of
                                            Senator Lorenzo Tanada, played an important role in the
                                            election of Mr. Magsaysay but generally lack any real
                                            political strength through a political party. Tanada’s
                                            Citizens party has many attributes in common with
                                            European Progressive Catholic political parties.
                                            Generally viewed as a “knight in shining armor”, Tanada
                                            is young, aggressive, absolutely honest but somewhat
                                            immature politically. He holds progressive social views
                                            which are probably less leftist than they were a few
                                            years ago. Philippine correspondents covering the Senate
                                            invariably list Tanada as one of the best men in the
                                            Senate.</p>
                                        <p>The Catholic Church played a much greater role in this
                                            election than they ever had in the past. A few days
                                            before the election Quirino, in a letter to the Papal
                                            Nuncio objected to the Church’s interference in the
                                            political campaign. Most of the leaders of the Catholic
                                            action, close associates of Tanada, ostensibly worked
                                            for honest elections; in fact, they also worked for the
                                            election of Magsaysay. According to one report of
                                            unknown reliability the Bishop of Jaro, in Iloilo, in
                                            effect endorsed Magsaysay publicly.</p></item>

                                    <item>Magsaysay was strongly supported by the principal
                                        organization of young business men and veterans,
                                        particularly the leaders of the Junior Chamber of Commerce,
                                        the Lion’s Club and the Philippine Veterans Legion. While
                                        some of these leaders may have personal political ambitions,
                                        the majority probably supported Magsaysay because of their
                                        desire to eliminate corruption and inefficiency from the
                                        Philippine Government. They in general represent the type of
                                        leadership which is to be found among organizations of young
                                        progressive businessmen in the United States.</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>These three groups will all compete in attempting to influence
                                Magsaysay’s policies. On the basis of what we know about Magsaysay,
                                it is likely that his personal attitudes are closer to the Catholic
                                progressives and the young business men than to the older political
                                leaders. Certainly, his attitude toward the need for reform of the
                                land tenure system, resettlement and the issuance of land titles
                                would receive more support from the younger element. It is
                                debatable, however, whether he will be able to obtain the necessary
                                cooperation from the Philippine Congress to carry out any drastic
                                reforms. The older entrenched party leaders will have firm control
                                of the Philippine Senate and very likely great influence in the
                                House. The followers of General Romulo in the Democratic party,
                                particularly the four Senators, formerly Liberals, who joined him,
                                are all seasoned politicians and more sympathetic to the
                                conservative social views of the Nacionalista leaders than they are
                                to the other group cited above.</p>
                            <p>On the basis of these considerations, it seems likely that there may
                                shortly develop a struggle within the Magsaysay camp to mold his
                                political and social thinking which is as yet relatively
                                undeveloped. There will inevitably be a series of compromises but it
                                seems likely that, if Magsaysay’s personal prestige and courage are
                                as great as we have been led to believe, he may be able to effect a
                                shift away from the traditional pattern of domination of the
                                Philippine Government by the absentee landlords and those who
                                represent them. Reports on Magsaysay’s personality do not indicate
                                that he is adept at the art of compromise. On the contrary, he has a
                                tendency to be impetuous. It is possible that if these disparate
                                elements find their differences irreconcilable the party will split.
                                In this event, Magsaysay would find it difficult to fulfill many of
                                his campaign pledges.</p>
                            <p>It is probable that the general moral level of government will
                                improve although a few of the most notorious scoundrels in the
                                Philippines, including Senator Cuenco and Governor Lacson, both
                                former Liberals, supported Magsaysay and Cuenco was elected to the
                                Senate as a Nacionalista. Lacson was defeated for the House of <pb
                                    n="561" xml:id="pg_561" facs="0581"/>Representatives and will
                                probably go to jail as he was recently convicted of rape and is
                                being tried for murder.</p>
                            <p>It is almost impossible to prognosticate Magsaysay’s economic
                                policies. There is no question that he has a burning desire to
                                improve the standard of living of the mass of the people. However,
                                as mentioned above, he will have considerable opposition from the
                                older leaders in his own party.</p>
                            <p>Magsaysay’s economic advisers represent a number of varying
                                viewpoints. Salvador Araneta and Senator Rodriguez are both
                                protectionists. Leo Virata and some of the Junior Chamber of
                                Commerce leaders might be expected to advocate a more liberal
                                foreign economic policy. Domestically the powerful Senate leaders
                                will oppose any radical departure from conservative economic
                                policies designed to protect the economic welfare of a relatively
                                small group which has traditionally dominated the Philippine
                                Government. Those supporting a liberal point of view will probably
                                have less political influence than the group favoring conservative
                                policies. Magsaysay’s foreign policy will depend largely on the
                                degree to which he is influenced by Senator Recto who has in the
                                past favored a “neutralist” policy similar to that of Indonesia or
                                India. It does not appear that even Recto will recommend any drastic
                                change from the traditional Filipino support of the Free World but
                                day-to-day relations on matters of less significance might become
                                more difficult. Many observers in the Philippines consider Recto the
                                most anti-American of any leading politician. He was imprisoned by
                                American troops immediately after the war and obviously harbors some
                                animosity toward us as does Laurel. However, it is not likely that
                                he will advocate policies which will seriously change the present
                                attitude of the Philippine Government toward international affairs.
                                General Romulo’s influence on Philippine foreign policy will be
                                limited because he has almost no real political power within the
                                Philippines. His political stature has increased in the last few
                                months but falls far short of being equal to that of either Recto or
                                Laurel.</p>

                                    economically dependent on the United States and that it condemns

                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Political Motivation</hi></p>
                        <p>The political motivation for revision of the Agreement derives from the
                            Agreement as a whole, and the trade provisions may be less important as
                            a motivating force than the parity and exchange provisions which many
                            Filipinos consider as unilateral in character and a reflection on their
                            sovereignty. There is also the view, which is fairly widely held among
                            Filipinos who are conversant with the history of the Trade Agreement,
                            that the Agreement was forced upon the Philippines by being made one
                            package with the Philippine Rehabilitation Act which the war-devastated
                            Philippines could <pb n="563" xml:id="pg_563" facs="0583"/>not afford to
                            reject. The desire to correct a relationship which seems to many
                            one-sided is a natural motivation which is bound to have popular appeal.
                            Actually, it is overshadowed in the minds of most Filipinos by the great
                            affection and admiration they have for the United States.</p>
                        <p>The request for revision, which was sparked by two leading economic
                            figures, Central Bank Governor Miguel Cuaderno and Finance Secretary,
                            Aurelio Montinola, was espoused particularly by the Liberal
                            Administration as a popular cause and a vote-getter. The effort to make
                            political capital out of revision was unsuccessful, however, because the
                            Nacionalista Party, so far as it took any stand on the question at all,
                            seemed to favor revision, and because too little headway was made with
                            the request for revision prior to the November elections for the
                            Government to be able to claim any particular credit for its effort in
                            this direction.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Outlook</hi></p>
                        <p>It is too early to tell what the Magsaysay Government, when it comes into
                            power on December 30, will do with regard to the proposals for revision
                            which have already been submitted by the present Government. Three
                            Nacionalistas, Senator Francisco Delgado, Congressman Jose Roy, and
                            banker Daniel Romualdez, were represented on the President’s 15-man
                            Commission that drew up the proposals. The Party’s top leaders, however,
                            have given no indication of their thinking on the subject, and there is
                            good reason to believe that most of them have not thought about it at
                            all. Senator Gil Puyat has publicly stated that he favored deferment of
                            the tariff provisions of the existing agreement rather than the
                            selective free trade arrangement suggested by Cuaderno, but in so doing
                            he was speaking for himself and not for the Party.</p>
                        <p>Revision of the agreement has been rather fully aired in the Philippine
                            press, with almost all publications appearing to favor it. Philippine
                            business groups and individuals who have had anything to say on the
                            subject have with very few exceptions advocated revision. Revision of
                            the kind proposed by the Government, namely, continued free entry for
                            Philippine goods going into the United States and the immediate
                            application of full tariffs on American goods coming into the
                            Philippines, except for those articles selected for free list treatment,
                            has naturally had considerable public appeal.</p>
                        <p>American investors in the Philippine export industries have been rather
                            inconspicuous in the movement for revision. When invited to express
                            their views in official hearings, however, a number of them have
                            stressed the need of their products for low or preferential duties in
                            the United States. The American Chamber of Commerce, <pb n="564"
                                xml:id="pg_564" facs="0584"/>which reflects more the view of
                            American importers into the Philippines, is distinctly cool to the
                            selective free trade proposal, or to any modification in the agreement
                            which would weaken the tariff preferences they now enjoy.</p>

                        <p>1360. Eyes only for Ambassador from Secretary. First let me express my
                            great appreciation of the able way you handled US interests during
                            difficult election period.</p>
                        <p>It seems here that election provides opportunity bring to forefront in
                            West Pacific non-western leadership which is respected and competent,
                            and which can help to invigorate and unify non-Communist Asian forces in
                            Indochina, Indonesia and perhaps Formosa and Korea. However, we think
                            now primarily of South East Asia. There is imperative need of this.
                            Would not Magsaysay and Romulo make a splendid team for this purpose?
                            Romulo’s extensive international experience would supplement Magsaysay.
                            This idea is looked on with favor in highest quarters here and I pass it
                            on to you for your consideration and any suggestions you might make as
                            to possibly implanting these ideas where they would bear fruit.</p>

                                see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, Jan. 4,
                                1954, p. 10.</note> I greatly appreciate your first paragraph. All
                            of us in Embassy and Vice President in complete accord remainder your
                            message. It is our opinion United States must do everything possible
                            make Magsaysay’s administration success. After he has achieved such
                            success domestically and so has prevented any substantial reduction in
                            his current prestige and popularity with mass of Filipino people, he
                            should assume natural position of leadership in Southeast Asia, perhaps
                            in Formosa, Korea.</p>
                        <p>There appears to be developing rift in coalition between Nacionalistas
                            and Democrats. Certain elements in both parties favor a merger, while
                            others within each party apparently desire to take over government
                            including Magsaysay. I do not believe Magsaysay will be taken over by
                            any group in either party so far as choice of his executive officials
                            are concerned. Control of Senate and House is different proposition,
                            however, which he recognizes as most important.</p>
                        <p>… I have talked to Magsaysay about appointment of Foreign Secretary. … He
                            has made no decision yet, but said he had been considering Garcia, his
                            Vice President, for post. Garcia is fine honest man, a lawyer, but
                            without any qualifications for position. …</p>
                        <p>Vice President Nixon thinks Magsaysay combines two qualities needed for
                            leadership in Asia: (a) magnetic appeal to all classes of people, (b)
                            genuine regard for the people’s welfare.</p>
                        <p>He was impressed by Magsaysay’s absence of any racial feeling and his
                            undisguised friendship for United States. He believes RM has six to nine
                            months hard work to set his own house in order and in meantime we should
                            begin necessary preparatory work in Southeast Asia; that he should not
                            tour area but that representatives on Prime Minister level should come
                            to Manila; that he should delay visit to Washington until he can in
                            address to joint session of Congress point to two concrete
                            accomplishments of (a) <pb n="566" xml:id="pg_566" facs="0586"

                            <item>As stated by Vice President Nixon, we must not allow Magsaysay
                                fail. Ability of United States to lead Southeast Asia and Far East
                                toward democratic way of life depends to important degree upon
                                success Magsaysay administration. We must demonstrate that
                                friendship toward United States earns friendship from United States.
                                But friendship toward Philippines cannot, and should not, consist
                                solely of necessary financial and technical assistance. It is,
                                perhaps, even more important that United States remove last vestiges
                                its economic domination of Philippines. We must prove to world, and
                                to this part of world particularly, that we want strong and healthy
                                Philippines for benefit of Filipinos and even at expense our special

                            <item>All other countries have right impose duties on United States
                                exports and it would play direct into hands of Communists to deny
                                that right to Philippines. Furthermore, advantages to American
                                business of duty-free status in Philippines were already somewhat
                                dissipated in 1949 when Philippines imposed import and exchange
                                controls with approval of United States. If negotiations for
                                revision agreement are handled properly, American businessmen as a
                                whole should lose no more from levying Philippine import duties than
                                they would gain from lifting controls and 17 percent tax. There
                                would be disadvantage to some American products from loss of
                                preferences, but similarly Philippine exports entering United States
                                which could survive without preferences could be progressively

                            <item>I expect Magsaysay advisors will recommend general endorsement
                                pending proposals, perhaps with minor amendments. If this happens, I
                                urge that United States agree conduct negotiations with Magsaysay on
                                basis those recommendations. Obviously, we cannot be expected adopt
                                all Philippine proposals. Embassy Foreign Operations Administration
                                study group recommended various modification of those proposals in
                                despatch 456. However, it would be serious blow to Magsaysay and to
                                United States stake this part of world if we were to refuse even to
                                negotiate.</item>

                            that (1) except for properties already conveyed to the Philippines, the

                                456. It was the legislation which provided for the independence of
                                the Philippines.</note></p>
                        <p>The situation in the Far East has changed drastically since 1948. China
                            has fallen into the Communist orbit; the hostilities in Korea have
                            pointed up the urgency of improving our defense in the Pacific; the
                            United States and the Philippines have entered into a Mutual Defense
                            Treaty; and the Philippines has not proved to be as cooperative as
                            anticipated with respect to our military and strategic needs.</p>
                        <p>As its contribution toward its own defense under the Mutual Defense
                            Treaty, and in consideration of the value of such of the U.S.-held
                            surplus lands as it may be decided should be transferred to the
                            Philippine Government, the Philippine Government should, I believe,
                            grant to us all other lands we need for our military and diplomatic
                            purposes.</p>
                        <p>I therefore recommend that the policy enunciated in 1948 be modified so
                            that the United States shall be free in the forthcoming negotiations to
                            consider and utilize those assets to which we retain title without
                            limitation or restriction in order to accomplish successfully the main
                            objectives of the mission, namely: (1) the acquisition of land required
                            for base expansion and diplomatic purposes, and (2) the over-all
                            settlement of property and related questions arising out of the Military

                            for Secretary and Assistant Secretary Robertson from Ambassador:</p>
                        <p>Revision of tariff provisions of trade agreement very important to
                            Magsaysay, and because our reliance on him in pursuit our political
                            objectives this region, we must assist him on <gloss target="#t_TA1"
                                >TA</gloss> revision. I strongly recommend we agree negotiate on
                            this point, but within broader framework than selective free trade
                            proposal so as to permit adherence our general trade policy and
                            international commitments. To extent such revision can promote
                            Philippine economic development and free exchange convertibility, which
                            are primary Philippine objectives in requesting it, revision will be
                            highly <pb n="573" xml:id="pg_573" facs="0593"/>useful to us. If US
                            executive declines to even ask Congress for temporary extension
                            duty-free period if Philippines requests it, this would have bad effect
                            on Magsaysay’s position here as well as on Philippine feeling toward US.
                            I would appreciate reconsideration Department position reference
                            telegram.</p>
                        <p>Revision of tariff provisions of agreement is heart of Philippine
                            proposals, and outright rejection this proposal by US will be sharp
                            rebuff new administration, reflecting on Magsaysay’s influence with US
                            and detracting from our influence with him. Embassy believes he is our
                            best hope in Southeast Asia, perhaps all Asia, as democratic example and
                            as authentic native leader in resistance to Communism, and that it is to
                            our political interest assist him this matter as far as we can.
                            Regardless of US willingness to consult on changes in non-tariff
                            provisions, which are important in terms of Filipino self-respect,
                            refusal undertake any revision of tariff provisions will be considered
                            here tantamount rejection proposals in general.</p>
                        <p>Embassy concurs Department’s view that neither country likely suffer
                            immediate adverse economic effects by coming into force of declining
                            preference arrangement. It believes, however, that Philippine economic
                            development would be accelerated by revision permitting application of
                            tariff to US articles, with specific exceptions, and providing for
                            abolition of import and exchange controls and taxes as recommended in
                            Embassy despatch 456, part IV, quota proposals.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d350fn2">See <ref target="#d346fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                    346</ref>.</note> These controls and taxes are today burden on
                            business and in some cases deterrent to new investment. Their removal
                            would benefit Americans doing business in and with Philippines, a fact
                            recognized by representative American businessmen with whom subject
                            discussed. Such revision would aim at achieving free exchange
                            convertibility.</p>
                        <p>Embassy recommends, therefore, in order secure political advantage
                            inherent in situation and to achieve economic results generally
                            beneficial to Philippines and in some respects also to American
                            business, that US indicate it prepared to consult with Philippine
                            Government as proposed by Department in part II, first paragraph,
                            reference telegram; and also prepared consult on possible revision of
                            tariff provisions of <gloss target="#t_TA1">TA</gloss> but without
                            limiting itself to selective free trade principle proposed by
                            Philippines. Embassy believes approach of this kind would be acceptable,
                            helpful to Magsaysay. Department will recall that from beginning
                            Philippines wanted general consultation and made specific proposals only
                            on our request.</p>
                        <p>Within this broader scope of consultations on tariff provisions it should
                            be possible eliminate most of adverse factors enumerated <pb n="574"
                                xml:id="pg_574" facs="0594"/>part I, reference telegram. For
                            instance, on Philippine exports to US: US could stand firm that no
                            ground existed for liberalization present <gloss target="#t_TA1"
                                >TA</gloss> provisions on sugar. Embassy confident this position
                            could be sustained. Same probably true for some other products such as
                            coconut oil, cigars, tobacco. On other Philippine articles where genuine
                            need was shown and for which Philippines constituted principal foreign
                            supplier, US might offer Philippines choice of: <list>

                                    provisions. Such course should give Philippines some
                                    satisfaction where needed, while avoiding conflict with US
                                    overall trade program and <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>
                                    commitments, and calming opposition of US and Cuban sugar
                                    interests. On US exports to Philippines we might accept
                                    principle of selective free trade, permitting imposition full
                                    duties on some American goods in return for: <list>

                        <p>Embassy convinced that nothing less than all-out effort by US Government
                            to get Congress to extend duty-free period sufficiently to permit
                            negotiation of changes would be understood here or accepted as consonant
                            with US professions of friendship for Philippines, if Philippines
                            requests extension. Evident that Philippine Government has accepted risk
                            of adverse action by Congress suggested in part I–b, reference telegram.
                            Philippine Government understands, however, that possibility of
                            completed action on wider revision prior July 1954 is remote if not
                            nonexistent.</p>
                        <p>If Congressional leaders, when approached by Department, are sufficiently
                            sympathetic to Philippine request for revision, Embassy suggests they be
                            asked whether, in addition to extending duty-free period, Congress would
                            request executive branch to negotiate and submit for Congressional
                            approval, a revised agreement with Philippines designed to accomplish
                            certain objectives, such as: <list>

                            Philippines after the election of last November in terms of (a) the
                            domestic problems facing the new President, (b) the current unsettled
                            matters in U.S.-Philippine relations, (c) the possible expanded role in
                            Southeast Asia of the Philippines under Magsaysay’s leadership, and (d)
                            the opportunities and courses of action open to the United States in
                            order to advance U.S. interests in the Philippines and in Southeast
                            Asia. The memorandum should be read in the light of the objectives and

                        <p>28. The United States should lend vigorous support to any realistic
                            program to eliminate the social and economic causes of Communism.
                            Although not yet set forth in detail, the new Administration’s program
                            may be expected to include such matters as vigorous enforcement of land
                            tenure laws, accelerated issuance of land title certificates,
                            improvement and extension of rural credit facilities and of agricultural
                            education and construction of safe water supplies and irrigation
                            systems. It is highly desirable that an <gloss target="#t_FOA1"
                                >FOA</gloss> program be provided for fiscal year 1955 to aid the new

                            economic development, by not only maintaining <gloss target="#t_FOA1"
                                >FOA</gloss> activities at previous levels but also enabling <gloss

                            opportunities for cooperation which may be anticipated as a result of
                            the expected vigorous attack of the Magsaysay administration on these
                            problems.</p>

                        <p>29. U.S. Military aid, training and advice, which have played a large
                            role in the successful campaign against the Hukbalahap, should be
                            continued to eliminate the few thousand armed communists still active
                            and to continue development of armed forces to improve their ability to
                            resist any external attack.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Development of Democracy.</hi></p>
                        <p>30. Efforts by other government agencies to strengthen basic democratic
                            procedures and attitudes through civic organizations should be continued
                            with emphasis on the development of popular understanding of the rights
                            and responsibilities of the citizen under a democratic government. Such
                            a program, based on long-term objectives and not on immediate political
                            goals, would contribute to political stability and strengthen any
                            Philippine Government acting in the best interests of the people.</p>

                                Asia.</hi></p>
                        <p>31. Magsaysay’s personal qualifications justify the hope that he may
                            develop as a leader of the anti-Communist forces in East and Southeast
                            Asia. The United States should favor and support such a development
                            while realizing, of course, that cultural and political conditions and
                            the current foreign policy views of some of the countries of East and
                            Southeast Asia indicate the existence in the area of many factors
                            tending toward disunity rather than toward cohesiveness. These
                            obstacles, although substantial, are not in the long run
                            insurmountable.</p>
                        <p>32. There is general agreement that Magsaysay should devote his energies
                            to a successful attack on Philippine domestic problems before embarking
                            on any full scale program to achieve the leadership of anti-Communist
                            elements in the general area. In the meantime he should be encouraged to
                            take the following immediate steps to lay a firm international base upon
                            which to build at a later date: <list>

                                    regard to Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek. There is a tendency
                                    in Philippine <pb n="578" xml:id="pg_578" facs="0598"/>public
                                    opinion to regard these men as autocratic dictators and as

                            </list></p>
                        <p>33. Simultaneously with these steps the Department should ask our
                            Embassies in the other countries of East and Southeast Asia to prepare
                            recommendations as to how relations between the Philippines and these
                            countries may be improved and developed. These recommendations, which
                            should reflect the views of all agencies concerned, would be conveyed to
                            Ambassador Spruance for his information, comments, and guidance.…</p>
                        <p>34. The rapid and successful disposition of pending United
                            States-Philippine issues, notably the bases matter and the trade
                            agreement, in a manner fair to Philippine aspirations would also be
                            helpful in laying a foundation for Magsaysay to assume a role of
                            leadership in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>35. Once Magsaysay has sufficiently consolidated his position in the
                            Philippines and it appears that his administration is well on its way to
                            fulfilling the promise on the basis of which he was elected,
                            consideration should be given to the next steps in the development of
                            his leadership. These steps would include the following: <list>

                                    countries would depend on conditions prevailing at the
                                    time.</item>
                                <label>b.</label>
                                <item>Contact between Magsaysay and the leaders of other East and
                                    Southeast Asian countries. These contacts should, if possible,
                                    develop through the normal diplomatic channels of the countries
                                    concerned. Magsaysay might visit some of the countries and
                                    receive visits from their leaders. A carefully considered
                                    program based on conditions prevailing at the time should be
                                    developed. If Magsaysay is to be a symbol of the war against
                                    Communism he should make his first visit to the battle fronts in
                                    Indochina and assure the Vietnamese soldiers and the troops of
                                    the French union of the solidarity of the people of the

                                <item>It is also desirable that relations between the Philippines
                                    and Australia and New Zealand be improved. There exists
                                    considerable prejudice in the Philippines at the present time
                                    against Australia and New Zealand because of Australian racial
                                    policy. Nevertheless, the realization that all three countries
                                    are faced with a common threat and may well find themselves
                                    fighting side by side would contribute to better relations. An
                                    invitation from the Australian Government for Magsaysay to visit
                                    Australia might aid in the attainment of this objective, but
                                    must be considered in the light of its effect on opinion in
                                    Southeast Asia.</item>

                            These paragraphs should be revised or amended to reflect current
                            conditions as soon as the Magsaysay administration has determined its
                            course of action and made a beginning toward carrying out the promises

                            anti-Communist elements of Southeast Asia and should emphasize the

                                the Embassy expressed the view that the enunciation of the “Asia for
                                Asians” theme recently by Guerrero and Recto was an excellent
                                development which could and should be used by the Department and
                                    <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> in Asian countries to show
                                that the Philippine leaders were not puppets of the United States,
                                were interested in Asia, and considered themselves Asian. All of
                                this would help to improve Magsaysay’s image as a potential regional
                                leader. (696.00/2–1054)</note> Department agrees desirability
                            Magsaysay and other Philippine leaders convince other free Asian nations
                            that Philippines, as fellow Asian nation, vitally interested Asian area
                            and problems, in order that Philippine example and influence may carry
                            greater weight.</p>
                        <p>However, Department agrees view … that widespread use in Philippines and
                            elsewhere of slogan “Asia for Asians” would be most unfortunate.
                            Regardless of intent of originators, would carry unsavory recollections
                            of Japanese wartime slogan and could easily be misinterpreted by public
                            at large to be anti-Western in intent. This would hardly be helpful to
                            U.S. stake in Far East, French in Indochina, British in Malaya, etc.
                            Therefore Department does not agree recommendation your tel 1713 re
                            Department and <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> utilization and
                            suggests that utilization by Philippine leaders be discreetly

                        <p>Department believes that theme advocating solidarity and cooperation free
                            Asian nations, avoiding innuendos exclusion of west and in fact

                                indicated that it was considering the possibility of taking up with

                        <list>
                            <item><p>Part I:</p>
                                <p>In general, we do not believe US Government should take
                                    initiative discuss broad range economic subjects with Philippine
                                    Government either during forthcoming discussions trade agreement
                                    or by separate but parallel action. It is highly probable that
                                    if broad discussions economic aid program were held concurrently
                                    with discussions trade agreement there would be widespread
                                    belief here that US trying buy trade concessions. One of major
                                    sources of irritation re present trade agreement is tie-in with
                                    passage Philippine rehabilitation act. In any case, we see no
                                    useful purpose broad discussion economic aid program at this
                                    time. Other matters which are more germane to discussion trade
                                    agreement will undoubtedly arise spontaneously during that
                                    discussion. We believe it desirable that Filipinos raise such
                                    matters on own initiative so as avoid implication US obliged
                                    extend trade or other concessions in return for negotiating
                                        <gloss target="#t_FCN1">FCN</gloss> treaty or other
                                    agreements.</p></item>
                            <item><p>Part II:</p>
                                <p>US should be prepared discuss factors affecting possibility
                                    reducing exchange controls, restoring currency convertibility
                                    and eliminating exchange tax. However, Filipinos will probably
                                    raise possibility their taking such steps if trade agreement
                                    were to be revised in accordance their proposals. If Filipinos
                                    do not initiate such discussions, it might become desirable that
                                    we do so. We should seek obtain objectives in question if we

                            has read document and concurs generally therein. Assumes Department will
                            bring up-to-date on such matters as recent appointments.</p>
                        <p>Our reaction this document is it may be somewhat over optimistic and
                            underestimates difficulties faced by Magsaysay. He has been in office
                            less than three months and is faced with lack of capable and dependable
                            men who think as he does and will support <pb n="583" xml:id="pg_583"
                                facs="0603"/>his policies. This is particularly true in Congress
                            where many even of his own party not notably enthusiastic about some of
                            his ideas and some perhaps would not be unhappy to see him fail.</p>
                        <p>Reference in document to majority control seems misleading. He is
                            independent minded and cannot be fooled long, but he must have better
                            men around him to accomplish what he wants to do. His field of choice is
                            sharply limited and some time may elapse before he gets a good working
                            team. There are age-old problems in the Philippines which he hopes to
                            solve and we think it would be a serious error on part of US Government
                            to assume that he can accomplish miracles over night or to write him off
                            as a failure if he does not do so.</p>
                        <p>On suggestions US course of action, Embassy believes maximum effort must
                            be made to avoid appearance of seeming to tell Magsaysay what to do.
                            There are elements who would be only too happy to attack Magsaysay if
                            they can get a good issue. From their point of view the best possible
                            issue would be his relations with US. The best charge would be he is an
                            American stooge. Embassy feels therefore extreme care must be used not
                            to take advantage of his eagerness to do what we suggest. He himself may
                            not appreciate the dangers of this.</p>

                        <p>This estimate was undertaken by the Intelligence Advisory Committee, at
                            the request of the National Security Council, in order to appraise the
                            prospects of the new Magsaysay administration in the Philippines.</p>
                        <p>The most pressing domestic task confronting the Magsaysay administration
                            is to increase agricultural productivity and to proceed with agrarian
                            reform. Significant progress in this program is likely despite
                            opposition from powerful elements.</p>
                        <p>Magsaysay has also set ambitious goals for his administration in the
                            achievement of economic stability and growth. He is likely to make some
                            progress toward achieving these goals by employing incentives to induce
                            productive private investment, and he may resort to deficit financing.
                            He will, however, continue to look to the US for financial assistance
                            for economic development.</p>
                        <p>In dealing with the US, the administration will be confronted with the
                            problem of reconciling the Philippine desire for special US treatment,
                            particularly in the field of trade and national defense, with the strong
                            Philippine desire for full national independence and freedom.</p>
                        <p>The Philippine Republic will probably seek to improve relations with
                            Japan and to expand Philippine-Japanese trade.</p>
                        <p>It is not likely that within the next few years the Philippine Republic
                            will of its own volition attempt to assume a position of leadership
                            among Southeast Asian nations or take a dominant role in any Far Eastern
                            regional security arrangements. However, the Philippines can contribute
                            to bringing about closer economic and cultural cooperation among these
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>A similar memorandum is being addressed to the Under Secretary.<note

                        <p>The reaction of the Manila press and Philippine public figures to the
                            Attorney General’s Opinion has bordered on the hysterical. With the
                            exception of one member of Congress (who does not enjoy an admirable
                            reputation) every public figure in the Philippines who has addressed
                            himself to our claims as set forth in the Attorney General’s Opinion is
                            in agreement that our position is completely unacceptable.</p>
                        <p>Two leading Senators are reported to have publicly advocated abrogation
                            of the Bases Agreement although one later denied having taken such a
                            position. Concurrently we have been attacked by members of the Senate
                            for alleged abuse of our jurisdiction within the bases and for failure
                            to provide adequate military aid to the Philippine Armed Forces.</p>
                        <p>Newspaper editorials and news writers and columnists have been even more
                            violent in their reactions.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Philippines Herald</hi> stated that the
                            deliberations of the Philippine panel studying the bases problem might
                            lead to a “thorough reexamination of Philippine-American relations”.</p>
                        <p>According to the <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> our claim to title “could
                            thus create an unnecessary irritant to Philippine-American
                            relations.”</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Manila Chronicle</hi> (owned by a brother of the
                            former Vice President and present Senator Lopez) stated on March 15 that
                            approval of the U.S. position would “justify the oft-repeated charge
                            that Philippine independence is nominal”.</p>

                                    Such an agreement, if it really exists, is nothing but a
                                    betrayal, and no time should be lost in abrogating it.”</p>
                                <p>“The last of the reports has it that, for bargaining purposes,
                                    the United States has tied up the base discussions with the
                                    negotiations for the revision of the Bell Trade Act. We
                                    sincerely hope this is not true, for if it is, the Philippines
                                    will be justified in accusing America of unfairness, and the
                                    accusation will stick.”</p>
                                <p>“In 1946, Manuel Roxas rode to victory as the favorite of
                                    Washington. There was no question at all that the United States
                                    favored him and helped him. He paid for that aid and support by
                                    handing over to the Americans, on a silver platter as it were,
                                    the approval of the Bell Act and the ratification of the Parity
                                    amendment. In two years, his stock was down, and at the time of
                                    his death, he was already the target of attacks, some bitter,
                                    all justified.”</p>

                                    not be used as bargaining point in negotiations on military
                                    bases.</p>
                                <p>Senator Lorenzo M. Tanada, President of the Citizens Party,
                                    voiced opposition to American ownership of military bases and
                                    said question of Philippine sovereignty over any portion of its
                                    territory should not be brought into the bases discussions.</p>
                                <p>Senator M. Jesus Cuenco, Foreign Affairs Committee, said: “We
                                    must not allow slightest encroachment on our territorial
                                    sovereignty”.</p>
                                <p>Senator Kangleon (Magsaysay’s predecessor as Secretary of
                                    Defense) stated that the bases agreement grants the Philippines
                                    nothing, and there is no guarantee that the U.S. will not pull
                                    out from the bases “when the going gets tough,” and deprecated
                                    the military assistance given the Philippines. He further
                                    pointed out that in return for military bases in Spain the U.S.
                                    promised in writing economic assistance of $500 million, that
                                    the Spanish agreement was for only ten years and that the terms
                                    of the agreement were much less onerous.</p>
                                <p>Representative Miguel Cuenco, Chairman, House Foreign Affairs
                                    Committee, and Representative Diodado Macapagal, foreign policy
                                    spokesman of the minority House, both urged resistance to the
                                    U.S. proposal.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The Magsaysay Administration recently reopened its military offensive
                            against the <gloss target="#t_HMB1">Huks</gloss>, thus concluding a
                            “cease fire” and a two-months’ period of “peace” negotiations with the
                            Communists. The cease-fire period may have enabled the Communists to
                            regroup their forces and strengthen Communist morale, but it also
                            provided the government an opportunity to resume its military offensive
                            with congressional support.</p>
                        <p>The Government’s negotiating terms were: (1) a gradual surrender (perhaps
                            up to six months) of all <gloss target="#t_HMB1">Huks</gloss> with their
                            arms; (2) surrenderees to stand trial if there were charges against
                            them; if not, they would be free to return to their homes or go to a
                            government settlement project; and (3) immediate receipt of a detailed
                            roster of <gloss target="#t_HMB1">Huk</gloss> personnel and a complete
                            inventory of all arms.</p>
                        <p>The Communists ostensibly were willing to agree to a gradual surrender of
                            men with their arms, but in addition insisted on two crucial points
                            which the government would not accept: (1) maintaining control over
                            their arms during the surrender period in order to guarantee the
                            government’s good faith; and (2) the lifting of the present legal ban on
                            the <gloss target="#t_HMB1">Huks</gloss>, the Communist Party, and the
                            Communist-controlled National Peasant’s Union (PKM).</p>
                        <p>By its willingness to negotiate on a basis of firm but generous terms,
                            the government has allayed congressional pressure for an amnesty with
                            the Communists and has placed the onus for the resumption of hostilities
                            on the Communists. In resuming military operations, the government now
                            faces the task of convincing Congress of the soundness of its decision
                            by producing tangible results. The government will probably concentrate
                            on capturing <gloss target="#t_HMB1">Huk</gloss> leaders in an effort to
                            demoralize the guerrilla movement. There is <pb n="590" xml:id="pg_590"
                                facs="0610"/>some evidence that even now the leadership is scattered
                            and that operations are poorly coordinated. However, there are no
                            indications that the major <gloss target="#t_HMB1">Huk</gloss> leaders
                            will defect under pressure. Mass surrenders appear unlikely since the
                                <gloss target="#t_HMB1">Huks</gloss> are already reduced to a hard
                            core of some 2,500.</p>
                        <p>The Communists will most likely strive to preserve the nucleus of their
                            military strength but will continue to agitate for “peace” and
                            legalization of their activities. It is unlikely that the government
                            will compromise on its “unconditional terms.”<note n="1"

                                <item>Political power in the Philippines now rests with a coalition
                                    of parties, in which the Nacionalista Party under the leadership
                                    of President Ramon Magsaysay is the major factor. Magsaysay,
                                    like the majority of Filipinos, is strongly pro-American. Some
                                    influential Nacionalista Party leaders are seeking to reduce
                                    cooperation with the United States under the guise of promoting
                                    closer association with other Asian states. However, these
                                    leaders are not likely to bring about a significant change from
                                    the basic Philippine pro-U.S. and pro-free world position
                                    recently restated by Magsaysay. It is important that the
                                    Filipinos act to the maximum extent possible on their own
                                    initiative and that other countries, particularly in Asia,

                                    and 1951. Communist influence in the labor movement is now of

                                    1946 Trade Act. The request of the previous Philippine
                                    Administration on May 5, 1953, for reconsideration of the terms
                                    of the present arrangement, contained proposals implying a
                                    review of this principle. The United States has now rejected
                                    these specific Philippine proposals, but has agreed to consider
                                    with the Philippines possible modification of all aspects of the

                                    provide employment and increase living standards. Substantial
                                    mineral deposits exist on which development work is in progress.
                                    Agricultural production is restricted by outmoded practices, by
                                    the limited area under cultivation, and by other factors which
                                    reduce incentive. Industrial production is restricted by
                                    insufficient investment and low worker productivity. Major

                                    Philippines recognized that an armed attack in the Pacific area
                                    on either country would be dangerous to the peace and safety of
                                    the other, and each agreed to act to meet the common danger in

                                    it is clearly in U.S. interests to encourage the eventual

                                    training agricultural leaders. The Health and Sanitation Program
                                    is assisting the Philippines to control malaria, establish rural

                                is devoted to materials in Chinese. All of the programs are in
                                native dialect and produced locally. A new Voice of America
                                transmitter has begun both medium and short-wave transmission in

                                584 (Fulbright Act) and Public Law 402 (Smith–Mundt Act). Under this
                                program 344 Philippine nationals have come to the United States and
                                81 Americans have gone to the Philippines. The Fulbright Act
                                provides for an exchange of lecturers, teachers, students, and
                                research specialists. The Smith–Mundt Act provides for an exchange
                                of civic leaders from the Philippines. Under the latter Act, 54
                                Philippine civic and industrial leaders came to the United States
                                and 8 American specialists went to the Philippines.</p>
                            <p>10. Expenditures under the Fulbright Act are financed from local
                                currency derived from the surplus property agreement with the
                                Philippines. Under this Act the amount of the program is limited to

                                20 years. Expenditures under the Smith–Mundt Act are financed by the

                            years, since each approach to the Philippines on the subject has
                            revealed that the Philippine Government adheres strongly to the view
                            that the Military Bases Agreement does not give the United States the
                            right to authorize unilaterally the entry of third power vessels and
                            aircraft into our bases. An attempt to solve the problem was initiated
                            in 1949, when negotiations were started which culminated in an exchange
                            of notes in late 1951<note n="3" xml:id="d360fn3">Not printed.</note>

                            the Embassy in Manila, and that the final version of the agreement was
                            based upon a memorandum sent to the Department by Rear Admiral J. H.
                            Thach, Jr., then Director, International Affairs, Office of the Chief of
                            Naval Operations.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of the agreement embodied in this exchange of notes, the
                            Embassy in Manila has subsequently attempted to facilitate the operation
                            of our bases in the Philippines by entering into arrangements with the
                            Philippine Government regarding third power aircraft. (The documents
                            providing these arrangements were transmitted to the Department of State
                            by the Embassy’s despatch number 791, dated January 20, 1954,<note n="3"
                                target="d360fn3">Not printed.</note> copies of which were sent to
                            the Departments of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force.) The Department
                            of State has been informed by Ambassador Spruance that, “I am of the
                            opinion that the documents enclosed in despatch No. 791 provide an
                            adequate solution. I have discussed this question <pb n="602"

                            Philippines have agreed are quite workable and satisfactory and we need
                            anticipate no trouble whatever”.</p>
                        <p>It is apparent from our negotiations with the Philippines that the
                            Philippine Government would not accept, as a matter of law, the view
                            that we have the right to authorize unilaterally the entry of third
                            power vessels and aircraft into our bases. This being so, it would
                            appear that our best approach would be to recognize the fact that there
                            may be differences between the two countries on the interpretation of
                            the Military Bases Agreement, and to seek new and more favorable
                            arrangements on the ground that unrestricted flexibility in the use of
                            our bases in the Pacific is vital to the defense of the Pacific area,
                            including the Philippines.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State will undertake to approach the Philippines along
                            these lines, but I do not believe that the present time is propitious,
                            or that we would be able at this time to secure Philippine agreement to
                            an improved arrangement. I cite below extracts from a recent letter from
                            Ambassador Spruance setting forth his reasons for opposing action on
                            third power access at present.</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“I think that the position advanced by the naval officers who talked
                                to you completely overlooks the fact that if we approach the
                                Philippine Government at this time, the preparation of the
                                Philippine reply would be handled by Undersecretary of Foreign
                                Affairs Guerrero. He has just received a great deal of publicity on
                                the doctrine of ‘Asia for the Asians’ which he expounded in a recent
                                speech. This is just the sort of an argument that Guerrero loves
                                and, ably seconded by Senator Recto, he would cite the Navy position
                                as being exactly the kind of thing he had in mind. He is quite
                                capable, if we take an extremely technical position, of taking a
                                leaf from the Russian book and pointing to the language of Article
                                III of the Bases Agreement, which says that we are given all rights,
                                power and authority we need ‘which are necessary to provide access’,
                                and to say in effect: ‘As we have no certain means of identifying
                                United States planes, it is necessary for our protection and
                                security that all planes approaching Clark Field come in along a
                                designated corridor and at certain heights’, such as by way of Subic
                                Bay or the Gulf of Lingayen. He could point out that we had
                                acquiesced in such an arrangement in Germany and he could put forth
                                an argument which would be most persuasive to the Filipinos that
                                this was an entirely reasonable suggestion.</p>
                            <p>“The question of what we do in comparable situations in other foreign
                                countries is one which the Filipinos watch very closely. That is why

                                    1953, p. 435.</note> because there have been frequent references
                                in the press recently indicating that Senator Recto and others have
                                some knowledge of the provisions of that agreement and believe that
                                our arrangements with the Spanish Government are much more favorable
                                to Spain than is our arrangement with the Philippines. I am not
                                familiar with the details of the Spanish Agreement or with any of
                                the arrangements for bases in other foreign states, but I would
                                doubt very much if we have taken such an extreme position in other
                                cases. It is all very well to say that the Philippines agreement is
                                quite a different matter—as it undoubtedly is—but it is something
                                else again to convince people like Recto and Guerrero that the
                                situation is different.</p>
                            <p>“I can appreciate the fact that the Navy Department, in considering
                                this question, may have been looking forward to some future period
                                when a government perhaps not so friendly was in power. But an
                                unfriendly government could find many other ways, if it wanted to be
                                technical, to harass us in the operation of our bases—as for
                                example, the question of limited access routes which I mentioned
                                above which might be much more serious. As mentioned in despatch No.
                                799 [<hi rend="italic">791</hi>], if President Magsaysay were to
                                agree to the Navy position, we would expose him to the most vicious
                                sort of attacks and I would strongly urge that our answer to the
                                Navy position should be to ‘let sleeping dogs lie’. I don’t have
                                anything to add to the views contained in despatch No. 799 [<hi
                                    rend="italic">791</hi>]. When it was in preparation I
                                communicated with Admiral Cruzen. His suggested modifications were
                                incorporated in the despatch before I sent it on.</p>
                            <p>“I am sorry that I cannot concur in the views expressed by my old
                                Service. I can fully understand the desire for the utmost freedom of
                                movement, but in this case I feel that the political realities of
                                the situation override the hypothetical risk involved. I appreciate
                                your writing me about this whole question.”</p>

                        <p>I agree with the Ambassador that we have more to lose than to gain by

                            United States. Ambassador Romulo left with me the attached

                            Articles III and V of the Treaty. He said that in view of the internal
                            political situation in the Philippines it would be most helpful if
                            President Magsaysay were in position to demonstrate that the Mutual
                            Defense Treaty is not a dead letter and that the Philippines is an
                            active factor in United States thinking. He said he hoped that a meeting
                            of consultation under Article III could be arranged here in Washington.
                            He would represent the Philippine Government and believed such a meeting
                            would be conducive to offsetting some of the harmful work that Senator
                            Recto and his followers, under the slogan “Asia for the Asians”, are
                            doing to amicable relations between the Philippines and the United

                        <p>I said that we would look into the suggestion regarding Article III of
                            the Mutual Defense Treaty, appreciating his point. At the same time, I
                            wondered how the conversations in Manila regarding U.S. bases were
                            getting along. He said this is an unfortunate matter. He thought that
                            what was intended by the agreements regarding bases is a 99-year lease
                            rather than deed in perpetuity. I asked him whether he had any
                            particular text in mind, but he seemed to be confused as to the language
                            explaining that in his opinion the principal thing is to have happy and

                            on legalisms. I told the Ambassador I had always been of the opinion
                            that the United States had acquired title to the bases and hoped this
                            question could be settled promptly and amicably so that we could get on
                            with so many other pressing matters. I also said we would let him know

                        <p>Romulo referred to previous conversation with Murphy and Philippine

                            and role of Philippine military establishment in defense plans. Romulo
                            envisioned results these discussions as basis talks between Secretary
                            Wilson and President Magsaysay.<note n="3" xml:id="d362fn3">Secretary of

                            assured him that Philippines would be kept fully informed of any
                            conversations with respect to united action in Southeast Asia. I pointed
                            out that, while we plan further steps with respect to organizing for
                            united action, we believe military action must await developments at

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Begin text:</hi> On 20 May 1954 I was invited by
                            President Magsaysay attend Security Council meeting at headquarters,
                            Armed Forces of Philippines. Present were President Magsaysay, Defense
                            Secretary Cabahug, General Vargas, General Balao, and members General
                            Staff.</p>
                        <p>Conference started by staff presenting to President two studies, one on
                            matters he would discuss at a caucus with political party leaders,
                            second, matters to be discussed with Secretary Wilson. President
                            directed proposals be presented to him verbally with pertinent extracts
                            being read. Staff appeared be greatly embarrassed my presence, hence I
                            volunteered, if desirable for security reasons, I leave room, I would be
                            happy to do so; whereupon President stated I was his military advisor
                            and he desired I be fully informed on all military matters. Staff then
                            started discussing terms of base agreement and security pact, indicating
                            certain changes that should be made. President stated very firmly there
                            would be no changes in wording of pacts; that Philippine Government had
                            made treaties and agreements and would carry them out; that he would
                            discuss with party leaders and with Secretary Wilson implementation of
                            terms of agreements and treaties. He further stated he would discuss
                            with political leaders conditions under which Philippine Government
                            would enter into an Asian or Southeast Asian bloc.</p>
                        <pb n="607" xml:id="pg_607" facs="0627"/>
                        <p>Captain Pargas, <gloss target="#t_AFP1">AFP</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_G31">G–3</gloss>, was then directed go over matters
                            which Armed Forces of Philippines were recommending President take up
                            with Mr. Wilson. Captain Pargas read certain extracts from security
                            treaty as background. He then said in view world conditions, it was
                            deemed necessary that Armed Forces of Philippines be greatly increased
                            and that it was desired to form seven divisions and five air wings; that
                            Philippines would not be able to fund such a force and that $960 million
                            would be required, both in hard and soft goods, from U.S. I was then
                            asked by President to present my views on such a request. My comments
                            were in substance as follows: That before serious consideration could be
                            given, I would like to know why such a force was required; what
                            intelligence studies had prompted their thinking; how such a force was
                            to be used, whether within Philippines only, or external use; some
                            details for creating such a force, such as construction of air bases,
                            camps and stations; where manpower was coming from, what training
                            programs would be required, amount of time required train crews, pilots,
                            etc. I emphasized that such a sum could not be even given serious
                            consideration without complete, detailed program with sound plan of
                            implementation. President then stated to staff he felt such a request
                            was beyond reason and would not even receive serious consideration from
                            US Secretary. He then directed they get down to earth and be realistic
                            in their thinking. He requested I express my views on a presentation
                            which would be, in my opinion, reasonable for requesting additional
                            assistance. My comments were in substance as follows: <list>

                                <item>Describe the force in being in Philippines and how it was to

                                <item>That the additional forces should be planned on a package
                                    basis such as one reserve division could be called up initially;
                                    that such a division would cost Philippine Government a certain
                                    amount for pay, food, allowances, etc., and would require
                                    equipment of a certain value; that Philippine Government could
                                    support and felt the need for two, four, six or some such number
                                    of divisions, that they could be called up within a stated
                                    period of time, and that if the US felt world conditions
                                    warranted such a force and was prepared support them
                                    financially, cost for number of divisions would be original
                                    package times number of divisions to be formed; that same
                                    approach should be taken on any plan to increase air force or
                                    navy.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>President then asked whether Secretary would want to know if such
                            additional forces created would be available for use outside
                            Philippines. My comment was I felt US Secretary would be interested.</p>
                        <pb n="608" xml:id="pg_608" facs="0628"/>
                        <p>A staff officer then compared terms of US–Philippines treaty with
                            US–Australian [<gloss target="#t_ANZUS1"><hi rend="italic"
                                >ANZUS</hi></gloss>?] treaty and with <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> treaty. It developed the main differences in these
                            treaties were the US–Philippine treaty does not provide for a permanent
                            standing committee. President then stated this was about what he was
                            going to present to Mr. Wilson and he wanted staff to prepare notes
                            along these lines, that they would meet again Monday morning.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d363fn2">May 24.</note></p>
                        <p>That US and Philippine Government appoint, under terms Article 3 of
                            treaty, a standing committee.</p>
                        <p>That US encourage using Philippine industries to supply military items
                            for other countries where US aid is being given, such as Formosa,
                            Indochina, etc. Purpose of this to improve Philippine economy and
                            working conditions throughout Islands.</p>
                        <p>That US agree furnish additional equipment so that at least one <gloss
                                target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss> and probably one division could be
                            called to active duty immediately. At present time there is
                            approximately enough equipment for two divisions within Philippines. He
                            desired additional equipment for a third division be furnished.</p>
                        <p>President then stated he would meet with Secretary Wilson on Tuesday,
                            that he desired Foreign Secretary, Defense Secretary and General Vargas
                            be present during conference; that he assumed Wilson would have members
                            of US staff present. In view Ambassador Spruance’s discussions with me
                            on this subject, I volunteered I thought this large group being present
                            initially at conference to furnish desired information, briefings, etc.,
                            might be desirable, but I recommended for his consideration that later
                            he and US Secretary meet alone and that any decisions and firm
                            commitments be made at that time. He neither accepted nor refused this
                            recommendation. President then directed Under Secretary Crisol start
                            preparations of a joint press release; that he wanted it distinctly
                            understood there be no press release made by anyone except joint
                            releases by himself and US Secretary, and that these releases would be
                            in writing so as minimize possibility of misinterpretation and to try
                            prevent misleading information appearing in press or being used by his
                            political opponents.</p>

                            feel President might well be criticized by having a non-Filipino citizen

                            classified as Top Secret: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Agenda matters to be taken up with Secretary Wilson regarding
                                    the implementation of the United States-Philippine Mutual
                                    Defense Treaty. This has been prepared for submission to the
                                    United States Secretary of Defense, the Honorable Chas. Wilson,
                                    on the basis of information that he has expressed willingness
                                    discuss the various matters contained in it with President
                                    Magsaysay during his visit Manila. Renewal of open Communist
                                    aggression in the immediate neighborhood of the Philippines in
                                    Asia, in which attempt the Communists have apparently met with
                                    initial success, has caused great concern on the part of the
                                    government and the Filipino people. This feeling has given rise
                                    to the need on their part for more definite assurance from the
                                    United States with which they have entered into a formal
                                    agreement of mutual defense and on which, because of the
                                    prevailing international situation, they have to rely for
                                    assistance in case of external attack. This concern is <pb
                                        n="610" xml:id="pg_610" facs="0630"/>based on their
                                    experience in the last world war. It is imperative that their
                                    feeling of security be restored and it is believed that this
                                    could be accomplished if a more definite clarification of the
                                    commitments of the US under the aforementioned treaty could be
                                    had, especially as such commitments may apply directly and
                                    specifically to the threat posed by the recent Communist gains
                                    in Indochina.</p>
                                <p>Despite the limitations in material resources from which the
                                    Philippines as a young nation as yet suffers, not to mention its
                                    other equally important and pressing preoccupations connected
                                    with nation building, it is prepared to fulfill its own
                                    commitments under the treaty. For this reason it is desirous of
                                    improving its present defense capabilities. And it is believed
                                    that the Philippines could more fully and effectively live up to
                                    its obligations under the aforementioned covenant if the United
                                    States Government could favorably entertain the following

                                            it is proposed that a council be created to be composed
                                            of representatives of the US and the Philippines. This

                                            <p>The Philippines has sufficient manpower. To enable
                                                this country to do its part in repelling external
                                                aggression and take care of its own internal
                                                security, the use of this manpower is believed
                                                urgently called for to augment and bolster the
                                                existing military, naval and air forces. Training
                                                can begin by phases, starting with at least one
                                                division. The United States Government, however,
                                                will have to underwrite expenses such as those for

                                                recruit and train a body of volunteer reserves and

                                                could be used without violating certain requirements

                            Government, it is suggested that a joint committee be created composed
                            of representatives of the two countries to discuss and agree on the
                            preliminary details thereof.”</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that Secretary Defense could give Magsaysay no satisfaction
                            on any of enumerated paragraphs except number one. Accordingly a press
                            release was drafted differing in no important respect from that which is
                            dispatched as UMPHE 06250800Z.<note n="5" xml:id="d364fn5">Not printed.
                                The press release expressed agreement on the establishment of a
                                joint U.S.-Philippine Council to hold discussions under Article III
                                of the Mutual Defense Treaty.</note></p>
                        <p>After luncheon 25 May Secretary Defense and Magsaysay adjourned to
                            latter’s private apartments where press release UMPHE 06250800Z and
                            Magsaysay memorandum were discussed. After some thirty minutes Admiral
                            Stump and I were asked to join the two and press release with minor
                            changes agreed upon. Secretary Defense made clear to Magsaysay that
                            remaining matters Magsaysay memo were to be held between the two of them
                            and would be dealt with at another time in some appropriate way.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Defense, Admiral Stump, Magsaysay, Cannon and I consider press
                            release best possible under circumstances. Magsaysay seems satisfied and
                            reasonably confident that he will not be <pb n="612" xml:id="pg_612"

                            remains to be seen.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Defense established unusually sympathetic relations
                            Magsaysay.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>General Romulo and Dr. Gamboa called on the Secretary this morning at the
                            Secretary’s request. The Secretary presented them with copies of a
                            “Philippine Talking Paper” (copy attached).</p>
                        <p>After allowing time for General Romulo and Dr. Gamboa to read the paper,
                            the Secretary elaborated on a few points. He said that the French are
                            still unable to make up their minds, and that they are using possible
                            U.S. intervention as a card to bolster their position at Geneva.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the United Kingdom had finally agreed to
                            participation in the Five Power military talks, adding that while those
                            talks are mostly “scenery”, the United States would keep the Philippines
                            fully informed.</p>
                        <p>In the course of the conversation, the Secretary stressed the importance
                            of holding Japan, Okinawa, Formosa, the Philippines and other areas
                            located off the Asian mainland. He referred to the Mutual Defense
                            Treaties which the United States has with the Philippines, Australia and
                            New Zealand and said that overt unprovoked Chinese Communist aggression
                            outside of mainland China would bring up the question of implementation
                            of these treaties. Asserting that if it became necessary to react to
                            overt Chinese Communist aggression, the Secretary expressed hope that we
                                <pb n="613" xml:id="pg_613" facs="0633"/>would have the support and
                            cooperation of the Republic of the Philippines pursuant to the Mutual
                            Defense Treaty and we would appreciate Philippine assurances to this
                            effect.</p>
                        <p>Following this statement, the Secretary asked if General Romulo or Dr.
                            Gamboa had any questions. General Romulo immediately referred to the
                            Secretary’s statement about the necessity for defending non-Communist
                            territories lying off the mainland of China and asked if the United
                            States was really determined to defend them against Communist
                            encroachment. The Secretary replied that the United States is determined
                            to stand and fight on that line in the event of aggression.</p>
                        <p>General Romulo referred to point (1) of the Talking Paper and asked when
                            the Council referred to in the Magsaysay-Wilson joint release of May 25
                            at Manila could be expected to be established. General Romulo said that
                            President Magsaysay had requested that the Council be set up as soon as
                            possible, adding that President Magsaysay was anxious to know what
                            responsibilities and obligations the Philippines would have to assume in
                            the light of the deteriorating situation in the Far East and the terms
                            of the Mutual Defense Treaty. President Magsaysay also wanted to know
                            what assistance and support the Philippines could expect to receive from
                            the United States. General Romulo also asked about the composition of
                            the Council and where its deliberations would take place. After Mr.
                            Drumright had read out a portion of the MagsaysayWilson joint release
                            pertaining to the establishment of the Council, the Secretary said that
                            these questions would require consultation with the Defense Department
                            and further discussions with the Philippine Government. The Secretary
                            expressed the personal view that the Council should be primarily
                            military in character. Mr. Drumright asserted the view that Manila would
                            probably be the most appropriate location for the holding of Council
                            meetings. The Secretary stated that steps would be taken promptly to
                            move toward establishment of the Council.</p>

                                        “collective defense” coalition in Southeast Asia. That is
                                        the possibility that Communist China might resort to open,
                                        unprovoked aggression by sending its army or air force into
                                        action outside of mainland China.</p>
                                    <p>The President and the Secretary of State have stated publicly
                                        and it has also been stated privately to the Soviet Foreign
                                        Minister, that overt aggression by Communist China would

                                        particular area of aggression. This declaration was made by
                                        the United States in the belief that the transition from
                                        indirect aggression to direct aggression would carry with it
                                        such grave implications to the Western Pacific position of
                                        the United States and its treaty allies that there would
                                        have to be an immediate reaction.</p>
                                    <p>This is a policy which stands independently of the Southeast
                                        Asia coalition. The United States hopes that if it is
                                        necessary for it to take action as indicated, it would have
                                        the support and cooperation of the Philippines, pursuant to
                                        the Mutual Defense Treaty. We would be glad to have
                                        assurances in this respect. We are seeking similar
                                        assurances from Australia and New Zealand.</p></item>

                                <item>The foregoing statement is precautionary only. There are some
                                    slight evidences that success may be going to the head of the

                                    direct aggression. However, the evidence is so far slight, and
                                    the United States present view is that such overt aggression is
                                    unlikely.</item>

                        <p>By way both of encouraging Malacanang to more self-dependence and of
                            keeping project on simple, overall basis for present stage, I feel
                            inclined respond to President’s approach by avoiding detailed guidance
                            and merely giving my general thoughts on following pattern:</p>
                        <p>Initial Philippines move could appropriately take form of brief note,
                            delivered here or in Washington which would: cite recent
                            Magsaysay-Wilson and Dulles-Romulo agreements (as phrased in respective
                            press releases) calling for council to further implementation MDT with
                            special regard for recent developments in Far East; state that
                            Philippine Government has appointed so and so to represent secretary of
                            foreign affairs on council and attend initial meeting; request that US
                            Government name its representative; and propose place and date for
                            initial meeting if agreeable to US Government. With view to reaching
                            prior understanding on scope initial meeting and type personnel
                            appropriate therefore, Philippine Government <pb n="618" xml:id="pg_618"
                                facs="0638"/>might also wish briefly to state its concept of the
                            overall problems that initial meeting should primarily analyze as basis
                            for broad directives for staff work to follow. As to its panel
                            personnel, Philippine Government might wish to name them tentatively or
                            merely to suggest number and type it would consider required for
                            proposed scope of meeting.</p>
                        <p>Knowing propensity for confusion inherent in Philippine foreign affairs
                            channels, believe it particularly essential however, to clear with
                            Department before responding to President’s request for advice. Feel it
                            most desirable to give him impression we are making things as easy as
                            possible for him, and, while appreciating that Department may have
                            reasons for avoiding haste. I know it unnecessary to describe what
                            unfortunate reactions could be produced here by any sign that hostile
                            elements could seize on as evidence that US Government was dragging its
                            feet in meeting Philippine desires.<note n="2" xml:id="d367fn2"><p>The

                        <p>The Philippine Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Jesus Vargas discussed
                            mutual defense matters with representatives of the Department of Defense
                            on June 16 and 17, 1954. In essence, General Vargas proposed that the
                            Philippine Army be increased to four infantry divisions, nine regiments
                            of security forces and one anti-aircraft brigade (present strength is
                            twenty-six combat teams); that the Philippine Navy be strengthened by
                            the addition of one antisubmarine warfare squadron, one mine warfare
                            squadron, one submarine squadron, and one marine battalion; that the
                            Philippine Air Force be modernized to eventually reach the strength of
                            five intercepter wings (jet powered), two groups aircraft warning and
                            control systems, one training wing, and one composite wing with
                            corresponding service units. This is a long-range program. General
                            Vargas’ immediate aims were to obtain the following assistance: <list>

                            </list></p>
                        <p>General Vargas stated that his long-range proposals represented tentative
                            levels contingent on U.S. military assistance and on the strength of
                            U.S. forces permanently stationed in the Philippines. Representatives of
                            the Department of Defense told General Vargas that the Philippine
                            requirements would be given due consideration. The Defense
                            Representatives also noted that while the proposal to add destroyers to
                            the Philippine Navy will be given full consideration, it has been
                            necessary to decline numerous requests for destroyer type vessels from
                            other nations due to a shortage for mobilization day requirements.</p>
                        <p>The Department of Defense Representatives who held these discussions with
                            General Vargas, believe that Vargas may ask for another meeting of the
                            military representatives in about a month. An officer of this bureau has
                            told Admiral Smedberg<note n="1" xml:id="d368fn1">Rear Adm. William R.

                            political reasons, to be able to give General Vargas a definite

                            and <gloss target="#t_ANZUS1">ANZUS</gloss> arrangements. President
                            stated categorically he would include no members Congress in “Philippine
                            panel.” President repeated Neri’s earlier query as to whether Honolulu
                            would be satisfactory locus for first meeting. I replied I had not
                            received instructions this point but considered my government would not
                            be unresponsive such proposal.</p>
                        <p>It apparent from further conversation President does not wish Garcia
                            discuss these matters Washington nor does he wish Garcia be senior
                            Philippine representative at first or subsequent meetings. I asked
                            President whom he had in mind as deputy to Secretary to act as senior
                            Philippine representative. President replied he wished Neri to do this
                            job and hoped US would find that agreeable. I replied American officials
                            held Neri highest esteem.</p>
                        <p>President has not yet discussed these matters with Vargas who presumably
                            will take similar line (Department telegram 3435).</p>
                        <p>In my opinion, based on oblique remarks Neri during and after
                            conversation with President, Garcia will be asked to return directly <pb

                            political importance Phil Govt attaches to first meeting. We have
                            assumed Phil desire establish Council motivated in large part by
                            necessity satisfying objections ultra-Nationalists to Philippine
                            participating United Action. If this view correct it would appear
                            maximum political impact would be obtained by Garcia meeting with
                            Secretary, who, because of heavy schedule, will not be able attend any
                            meeting outside U.S. as suggested by Magsaysay. Philippine Embassy has
                            been notified Garcia plans arrive New York July 4 and Washington July

                            pouched. We believe substantive matters relating mutual defense
                            including Vargas’ proposals can now best be handled by military
                            representatives possibly at Honolulu. Philippine domestic political
                            requirements would be satisfied by talks during Garcia’s visit here.
                            Inasmuch as only Philippine proposals we have received deal with matters
                            of strictly military nature, we believe no useful purpose could be
                            served by meeting of deputies.<note n="2" xml:id="d370fn2"><p>On July 2,

                                    observers. Intensification of ultra-nationalism, particularly on

                                    Government. Magsaysay himself has lent credence to these charges
                                    by seeking aid and advice from American officials which he
                                    properly should obtain from leaders within his administration.

                                    encountered. First, counterpart will not be deposited against

                                    available as a means of financing the local currency costs of
                                    technical cooperation and development projects. Alternative
                                    sources of peso financing will have to be found for these
                                    projects. Second, loan repayment will reduce the resources which
                                    the Philippines will be able to devote to carrying out the
                                        <gloss target="#t_NEC1">NEC</gloss> development problem.
                                    Both of these problems and the effect they will have on the

                                    it would not be desirable to bring up title to bases question at

                                    in private conversation with Magsaysay could bring up matter and
                                    emphasize desirability of pushing things to a settlement. I get

                        <p>The Council formally convened after a large group of photographers had
                            completed their assignments.</p>
                        <p>Vice President Garcia, speaking without notes, made a very brief opening
                            statement stating that what he was about to present to the American
                            delegation was not new but had previously been presented to American
                            officials in Washington by General Vargas. He concluded by presenting
                            the document marked as Enclosure 2.<note n="6" xml:id="d375fn6">Not
                                printed. The document was a draft Philippine proposal for an
                                executive agreement on implementation of the U.S.-Philippine Mutual
                                Defense Treaty. It called for U.S. aid to the Philippine Army, Navy,
                                and Air Force, both in hardware and soft goods, economic and
                                financial aid, assistance to civil defense, dollar grants to enlarge
                                Philippine industrial facilities, and placing of off-shore
                                procurement orders in the Philippines, among other things.</note>
                            Secretary Dulles then made his opening statement attached (Enclosure
                                3)<note n="7" xml:id="d375fn7">Not printed. In it, Dulles stated
                                that the United States would honor its treaty commitments by acting
                                automatically and immediately in the event of aggression against the
                                Philippines.</note> and suggested a half hour adjournment in order
                            to permit the American group to examine the Garcia document.</p>
                        <p>The session reconvened at 11:35 (other matters requiring the Secretary’s
                            attention had come up which caused a slight delay). Secretary Dulles
                            stated that the United States delegation had examined the document
                            submitted by Secretary Garcia. He prefaced his comments on the
                            substantive points, however, by explaining in considerable detail why it
                            was not practicable for him at this time to <pb n="630" xml:id="pg_630"
                                facs="0650"/>make an executive agreement of the character envisioned
                            by the Philippine delegation. He explained customary United States
                            procedures in such negotiations and pointed out that there were certain
                            points mentioned in the document which he believed we would be able to
                            state we could favorably consider, other things which we would have to
                            say we could not do and certain items in a middle ground where he could
                            not take any firm position for the reason that he could not commit the
                            Department of Defense. He explained at considerable length the problems
                            arising out of allocations of funds under the Mutual Security Act and
                            the difficulties faced by the Defense Department in distributing those
                            funds in areas of danger among the free nations all of which were making
                            requests similar to the Philippine Government. The Defense Department
                            was therefore compelled to consider the total world situation before it
                            could make specific commitments to particular countries.</p>
                        <p>Commenting on the substantive points which he noted were similar to
                            points raised by General Vargas previously in Washington, the Secretary
                            stated that he was in a position, however, to make some general
                            statements as to the United States position and views. He stated that
                            the United States was prepared to assist in the establishment of two
                            full divisions and two training divisions of the Philippine Islands but
                            was not prepared to make a comparative commitment on the naval and air
                            arms of the Philippine armed forces. He pointed out that the United
                            States had large naval and air forces in the area and wished to avoid
                            the expense of duplicating these forces, but that we considered the
                            building up of land forces most urgent and of a higher priority than the
                            air and naval arms. He stated categorically that the United States was
                            prepared to bear the cost of supplying the “hard goods” for these four
                            divisions but at the present time he was not in a position to make any
                            commitments as to “soft goods” although he said that the question of the
                            supply of “soft goods” insofar as the Philippine foreign exchange
                            position was concerned was being sympathetically considered by State and
                                <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Commenting on what we would do in the event of war, the Secretary
                            remarked that he was not in a position to discuss specific details of
                            this nature which was the responsibility of military representatives but
                            he referred to his comments on our general responsibility toward the
                            Philippines in his opening statement.</p>
                        <p>On the questions raised by the Philippine document as to offshore
                            procurement, he pointed out that these could be dealt with only on a
                            specific basis but that there was no objection on the part of the United
                            States but even a desire to build up procurement of military supplies in
                            offshore areas.</p>
                        <pb n="631" xml:id="pg_631" facs="0651"/>
                        <p>Commenting on industrial build-up, he made remarks of a similar
                            tenor.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary spoke at some length on the interest to the Philippine
                            Government in setting up consultative machinery, his general position
                            being that he felt that there were already adequate facilities for
                            consultation and that the United States did not desire to build up
                            “machinery for the sake of having machinery” or to set up committees
                            which would find themselves with nothing to do. He referred to the type
                            of consultation which occurred when Secretary Wilson recently visited
                            Manila and its fruitful results.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Garcia asked specifically what the United States could approve
                            in the program and Secretary Dulles replied that he could go no farther
                            in the way of firm commitments than that embodied in the promise of
                            support for the four divisions, but this did not mean that everything
                            else was excluded, and he suggested that a communiqué be issued in the
                            afternoon which would cover the area on which agreement was reached and
                            the areas which would be kept under study.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Stump, in commenting on the question of liaison, referred to the
                            record of frank and honest conferences between the military services of
                            the two countries and that he was prepared to come to see General Vargas
                            or have General Vargas come to Honolulu for consultation at any time and
                            he indicated he thought present procedures adequate for liaison
                            problems. He added that it was the position of the Department of Defense
                            that the Philippine Government should bear the cost of the armed forces
                            other than the expense of the hard goods.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Garcia, in commenting on the request for assistance, also dwelt
                            at considerable length on the Philippine desire for a build-up of its
                            naval and air arms. It was quite apparent that Secretary Garcia was
                            interested in these matters with a view to having something which would
                            be visible to the general public. Secretary of Defense Cabahug made no
                            statements whatever during the entire meeting.</p>
                        <p>General Vargas spoke with great earnestness on his interest in the
                            development of the air and naval arms and on the need of convincing the
                            Philippine people that the Philippine Government had something of its
                            own. He dwelt on the effect of morale in the Philippine armed forces and
                            emphasized that the Philippine economy could not support even the supply
                            of soft goods for the armoured divisions, remarking that if the
                            Philippine Government could not get air and navy support, they might not
                            see the necessity of increasing the ground forces. The Secretary, in
                            reply to General Vargas, said that he was entirely sympathetic to his
                            point of view but that the enemy operated on internal lines and if the
                            free nations <pb n="632" xml:id="pg_632" facs="0652"/>attempted to
                            maintain sufficient strength at all points of possible attack there was
                            simply not enough strength to go around.</p>
                        <p>Following General Vargas’ remarks, the Secretary pointed out that the
                            suggested Philippine program looked forward several years and that the
                            United States could not as a practical matter commit itself except on an
                            annual basis, but that the Filipinos need not conclude that there was no
                            possibility of a build-up in their strength. He emphasized that the
                            United States feeling was that the major effort should be in terms of a
                            build-up of a land force for this year, and for the time being at least,
                            primary dependence in the area should be placed on United States sea and
                            air forces.</p>
                        <p>In commenting on General Vargas’ statement that the Philippine economy
                            could not stand the cost of maintaining ground forces, the Secretary
                            remarked that a similar problem existed in the United States and pointed
                            out that during the coming Congressional campaign the Administration
                            could expect to be criticized for not being able to balance the budget
                            and that all of this involves sacrifices which would have to be borne as
                            long as the danger existed but that the United States was making
                            sacrifices and was giving increased priority to the Philippines in our
                            scheme of things.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Neri spoke briefly stating he was impressed by the United
                            States appraisal of the situation and could find no cause to differ on
                            any basic matter but he wanted to speak frankly on these matters in the
                            light of the coming <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>
                                Conference.<note n="8" xml:id="d375fn8">For documentation on the
                                    <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Conference, held
                                September 6–8 at Manila, see <ref target="frus1952-54v12p1#pg_835"
                                    >Part 1, pp. 835</ref> ff.</note> He thought a build-up of the
                            Philippine armed forces would be an important consideration in that
                            Conference because the Philippines had been held up in Asia as a model
                            in handling the Communist problem and he made an appeal for support of
                            their proposals for the effect it would have on President Magsaysay.
                            Secretary Garcia, just before adjournment, made an effort to get the
                            Secretary to spell out specifically what he could approve, what he could
                            not approve, and what would be given sympathetic consideration, but the
                            Secretary reiterated that he could not commit himself more than he had
                            done, reminding the Philippine Delegation that he could not speak for
                            the Department of Defense.</p>
                        <p>Just before the close of the meeting Secretary Garcia again made a strong
                            plea for concessions, particularly on strengthening the air force,
                            basing his arguments largely on morale factors and remarking that the
                            Filipinos feared that in the event of war United States air strength
                            might be diverted to some other area. The Secretary suggested that the
                            technical staff should get together for further <pb n="633"
                                xml:id="pg_633" facs="0653"/>discussions but General Vargas took the
                            position that in view of announced decisions no further staff work could
                            produce anything and decisions were now required. Secretary Dulles
                            disagreed with this position but the conference adjourned at 12:50 with
                            the understanding that during the luncheon period a communiqué would be
                            prepared.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Afternoon session</hi></p>
                        <p>The Conference was originally scheduled to reconvene at 3:00 p.m. but
                            Secretary Garcia sent word that the Philippine delegation would not be
                            ready to meet until 3:30. About 3:45 President Magsaysay, accompanied
                            only by General Romulo, came to the American delegation room and said
                            the Philippine group was very unhappy over failure to mention the supply
                            of soft goods in the draft of the joint communiqué which had been
                            prepared by the American staff following the adjournment in the
                                morning.<note n="9" xml:id="d375fn9">Not printed.</note> He
                            mentioned also the omission of any promise or implication that the
                            United States would assist in strengthening the Philippine naval and air
                            forces. President Magsaysay was anxious to have something inserted in
                            the communiqué which would offer some encouragement at least to the
                            Philippines on these two points. Secretary Dulles explained again, as he
                            had explained to Secretary Garcia in the morning session, the
                            difficulties of accommodating the Filipinos in this respect. Certain
                            minor changes, however, were inserted in the communiqué which were
                            apparently acceptable to President Magsaysay and he then took the
                            revised draft back to his delegation. He brought the paper back a few
                            minutes later, this time accompanied by Romulo and Neri and one or two
                            minor modifications were again made and the paper taken back to the
                            Philippine caucus room. However, it was not until 5:20 that the Council
                            was reconvened to approve formally the communiqué finally released
                            (Enclosure 4). Before that time Secretary Dulles had to leave the
                            building on other business and Ambassador Sebald, in his absence, agreed
                            verbally with Secretary Garcia that the communiqué as finally drafted
                            was satisfactory to both sides. After an exchange of the usual amenities
                            the meeting finally adjourned at 5:25.</p>
                        <p>It was significant that neither Garcia nor any of the Philippine military
                            personnel appeared on the scene after the adjournment of the morning
                            session. It seems quite clear that President Magsaysay took the matter
                            into his own hands and decided that it was the part of wisdom for the
                            Philippine Government to accept without further quibbling what the
                            United States Government was prepared to offer.</p>

                            <p>A meeting of the United States-Philippine Council, established on
                                June 23, 1954, between the two Governments pursuant to the
                                provisions of the Mutual Defense Treaty of August 30, 1951, was held
                                at Malacanang today (Saturday, Sept. 4).</p>
                            <p>Vice President and Secretary of Foreign Affairs Carlos P. Garcia, and
                                Secretary of State John Foster Dulles exchanged views on the threat
                                to the free countries of Asia, with special emphasis on defense of
                                the Philippines.</p>
                            <p>They agreed that in view of the developments in Southeast Asia the
                                defense of the Philippines requires that the Armed Forces of the
                                Philippines be strengthened through cooperative efforts. This is to
                                be accomplished primarily through a balanced strengthening,
                                reorganization, and modernization of the Ground Forces of the
                                Philippines and is to be undertaken with U.S. assistance. Secretary
                                Dulles stated that further consideration was being given by the
                                Department of Defense to the proposal to develop the Philippine Navy
                                and Airforce.</p>
                            <p>The Philippine government presented specific proposals for the
                                strengthening of its armed forces for external defense, including a
                                plan to reorganize its army on a four-division force basis. The
                                United States concurred in the necessity for achieving this
                                objective. Secretary Dulles stated that the United States would
                                furnish the major portion of the military matérial requirements for
                                such an expansion of the army and would search for means to assist
                                the Philippines toward meeting the foreign exchange and other
                                burdens occasioned thereby.</p>
                            <p>The necessity for adequate civil defense was also indicated by the
                                Philippine government and was fully recognized and appreciated by
                                both parties. Secretary Dulles said that the United States would
                                cooperate through existing facilities to aid in the establishment of
                                a civil defense organization.</p>
                            <p>In response to a Philippine request that the United States place
                                offshore procurement orders in the Philippines, Secretary Dulles
                                said that the appropriate agencies of the United States Government
                                would be willing to consider specific requests for the placement of
                                procurement orders for such goods and services as can be
                                economically obtained in the Philippines.</p>
                            <p>In the course of the Council meeting, Secretary Dulles reiterated the
                                intention of the United States, in coordination with the government
                                and Armed Forces of the Philippines, to ensure the defense of the
                                Philippines against aggression. The sense of Secretary Dulles’ <pb
                                    n="635" xml:id="pg_635" facs="0655"/>remarks to this effect is
                                to be incorporated in a note to the Government of the
                                    Philippines.<note n="10" xml:id="d375fn10">The note was
                                    forwarded under date of Sept. 7. (Enclosure 5 to despatch 245
                                    from Manila)</note> In this connection, Secretary Dulles said,
                                “I wish to state in the most emphatic terms that the United States
                                will honor fully its commitments under the Mutual Defense Treaty. If
                                the Philippines were attacked, the United States would act
                                immediately.” Agreement was reached on measures to effect close
                                coordination in U.S. and Philippine efforts.</p>
                            <p>These agreements demonstrate the close relations between the United
                                States and the Philippines, the firmness and unity of purpose, and
                                the close coordination and harmony which is being achieved through
                                the Philippine-United States Council of Foreign Ministers. Further
                                coordinating and implementing details will be effected between the
                                respective military representatives and the subordinate
                                commanders.</p>

                        <p>In the attached memorandum from Mr. Langley to Assistant Secretary
                                Robertson,<note n="2" xml:id="d376fn2">See attachment 1,
                                below.</note> Mr. Langley notes that the principal point at issue at
                            the present time in the negotiations is the Philippine insistence upon
                            revision of the provisions calling for the imposition of U.S. tariffs on
                            Philippine exports to the United States. The essence of the Philippine
                            position, Mr. Langley believes, is that they wish <pb n="636"
                                xml:id="pg_636" facs="0656"/>the tariff provisions revised so as to
                            provide an indirect subsidy. In plain terms the Philippine Delegation
                            wants dollar aid.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Langley recommends that “there may be a need for some ‘grand gesture’
                            “ and suggests that when Senator Laurel calls on President Eisenhower,
                            publicity might be given to a promise of additional United States
                            financial aid.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Baldwin in commenting to Mr. Robertson on Mr. Langley’s memorandum
                            (see attached memorandum from Mr. Baldwin to Mr. Robertson)<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d376fn3">See attachment 2, below.</note> notes that it would
                            be politically undesirable to interrelate U.S. economic aid with changes
                            in the Trade Agreement. He points out that anti-American elements might
                            argue that the United States is attempting to buy a trade agreement
                            which would prove otherwise unacceptable to the Philippines. As an
                            alternative, Mr. Baldwin suggests that the United States might grant the
                            Philippines an extended period of duty-free access to the American
                            market to be followed by a period of gradually increasing tariffs. At
                            the same the Philippines would be allowed to impose promptly heavier
                            duties than the present agreement provides upon American imports into
                            the Philippines.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Discussion:</hi></p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_PSA1">PSA</gloss> should, I believe, fully concur in
                            Mr. Baldwin’s position that there should be no economic aid <hi
                                rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi> in exchange for Philippine
                            concessions on the Trade Agreement. The United States legislation (War
                            Damage Act of 1946) granting war damage payments to the Philippines
                            sharply limited payments to private Philippine citizens until the
                            Philippines had approved the Philippine Trade Agreement. This
                            interrelation of U.S. financial aid with the Trade Agreement of 1946 has
                            been a consistent political liability. The Philippines have argued
                            repeatedly that the Trade Agreement was forced upon them in order to
                            qualify for the war damage payments. This mistake should not be
                            repeated.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Baldwin’s suggestion that the Philippines be granted an additional
                            period of duty-free entry into the U.S. market is in close accord with a
                            recent suggestion made by <gloss target="#t_PSA1">PSA</gloss>/<gloss
                                target="#t_E1">E</gloss> to Mr. Braddock of the U.S.

                            proposal the Philippines would be accorded 5 more years of duty-free
                            entry in return for which the United States would impose full duties on
                            Philippine products 5 years earlier than is now provided for in the
                            existing agreement (1969 rather than 1974). This might be justified to
                            the Congress as sort of a “loan” of 5 years to the Philippines,
                            justifiable on the grounds that it took the Philippines 5 years longer
                            than was anticipated <pb n="637" xml:id="pg_637" facs="0657"/>originally
                            to restore its war devastated economy. This proposal is now being
                            considered by the United States Delegation.</p>
                        <p>The fact that there should be no interrelationship between U.S. economic
                            aid and provisions in the Trade Agreement does not necessarily, however,
                            mean rejection of Mr. Langley’s proposal that some sort of publicity
                            regarding U.S. economic aid might be issued at the time of the
                            Laurel/Eisenhower talks. If in Mr. Langley’s judgement the issuance of
                            some such statement would considerably facilitate the negotiations, it
                            is suggested that the Department might prepare a press release to be
                            issued on that occasion along the following lines: <quote

                                    development. President Eisenhower reiterated the intention of
                                    the United States to continue to extend economic aid to the
                                    Philippines for this purpose. In this connection the President
                                    stated that the United States Government was considering a
                                    proposal to increase its economic aid program next year to the
                                    Philippines by extending long-term loans to further the
                                    industrialization and other aspects of the economic development
                                    program of the Philippines.</p>

                        <p>The last mentioned point regarding long-term loans for industrialization
                            has been recommended by our mission in Manila (Tousfo 420)<note n="5"

                            approved by <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>/Washington and the
                            Department. Since we plan to go ahead with this program now, it might
                            seem wise to gain some political advantage by having it announced at the
                            time of the Laurel/Eisenhower conversations.</p>
                        <p>A collateral purpose of such a public announcement would be to provide
                            the President with something which Laurel could point to as an
                            accomplishment flowing from his talk with the President. It is not
                            expected that the President would be in a position at the time of the
                            talk to comment other than in generalities upon the question of the
                            Trade Agreement.</p>
                        <p>Special care would have to be exercised in the drafting of any press
                            statement to avoid interrelating the Trade Negotiations and the proposed
                            increase in aid.</p>
                        <p>I have discussed this proposal informally with the <gloss

                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Philippine Situation</hi></p>
                            <p>The Philippine Trade Mission came to Washington with two general
                                well-advertised demands—revision of the 1946 Agreement trade
                                provisions and elimination of impingements upon their sovereignty
                                contained therein. Of these they rate the first the more important,
                                privately, and their protests on the second are obviously intended
                                primarily to improve their bargaining position on trade matters.</p>
                            <p>Their trade demands are not really that, but efforts to obtain,
                                through a rearrangement of tariff provisions, an indirect subsidy.
                                In short, they want financial help in some form, and their privately
                                expressed views to me indicate they are not too particularly about
                                the form, so long as they get the aid.</p>
                            <p>Senator Tanada has confided that we will have no trouble at all with
                                them about matters like parity if we will only go along with their
                                trade proposals. Senator Laurel, asked by me as to when he might go
                                home, in view of his obvious desire to do so as soon as possible,
                                said: “I can’t go home until I have something to take with <pb
                                    n="639" xml:id="pg_639" facs="0659"/>me.” Even though he,
                                individually, seems most concerned about matters involving the
                                sovereignty of the Philippines, he goes along with his Delegation in
                                wanting dollar aid in some form or by some device, and says that
                                political liberty will fail without economic support.</p>
                            <p>In individual talks with me the Philippine leaders, including
                                Governor Cuaderno and Senator Puyat, are quite frank in discussing
                                what they are trying to achieve. They want a trade arrangement which
                                will permit them to recapture tariffs we do not apply to their
                                articles coming into this country, while we start paying tariffs to
                                further swell their national receipts. They even have worked out
                                tentative ways and means of taking advantage of such a situation,
                                including the drafting of bills for presentation to their next
                                Congress.</p>
                            <p>Our approach, up to this time, has been to treat sympathetically
                                their protests about impingments on their sovereignty, while in the
                                trade area we have tried to conceive arrangements which would even
                                give them some increase in preferences, without a corresponding
                                increase in our own, within general administrative policies.</p>
                            <p>I still feel that such adjustments in the Trade Agreement are
                                possible and desirable, both politically and economically, but I
                                also feel that there may be need for some “grand gesture” also.</p>
                            <p>As we negotiate, the Premier of Pakistan comes to Washington, stays a
                                couple of days, and goes home with a promise of quadrupled American
                                economic and military aid. This occurrence was not overlooked by the
                                Filipinos.</p>
                            <p>The Trade Negotiations Delegation is not in a position to discuss aid
                                with the Philippines. However, a little coordination at this point
                                between the work of this Delegation and top policy officers of the
                                Government might operate to produce a better climate in which to
                                conclude the negotiations on a sane trade and political basis, plus,
                                possibly, negotiating an <gloss target="#t_FCN1">FCN</gloss> treaty,
                                so that the overall political picture in the Far East could be
                                definitively improved, not only in the Philippines, but through
                                indirect reactions by other Far Eastern nations.</p>
                            <p>Senator Laurel is to pay a call upon President Eisenhower on November
                                2, carrying with him a personal letter from President Magsaysay of
                                the Philippines.<note n="7" xml:id="d376fn7">Senator Laurel saw
                                    President Eisenhower on Nov. 3. The letter is not
                                    printed.</note> If anything were to be worked out in the way of
                                promises as to aid (such as assurance that the considerable balance
                                of <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> aid originally indicated, but
                                not yet realized, would be given) it would seem that the
                                Eisenhower-Laurel meeting might be the proper occasion and
                                opportunity to tell President Magsaysay and the world about it. Here
                                is a possible opportunity <pb n="640" xml:id="pg_640" facs="0660"
                                />to do something when it could redound to this Government’s credit
                                rather than later in desperation.</p>
                            <p>In any event, the status of the negotiations would seem to indicate
                                the desirability of immediate policy discussions at a higher level
                                than is provided for by the composition of the negotiating
                                delegation which I head.</p>

                            <p>The attached memorandum from Jim Langley<note n="8" xml:id="d376fn8"
                                    >Attachment 1, above.</note> deals with a situation which is
                                potentially very serious. The situation is complicated not only by
                                the difficulties mentioned by Langley but by the fact that the large
                                Philippine delegation contains numerous members of Congress who
                                either are important or consider themselves to be important, all of
                                whom are becoming increasingly restive. I have sent a copy of the
                                Langley memorandum to Tyson, asked him to consider it carefully and
                                express his views. My tentative opinion is as follows: <list>
                                    <label>1.</label>
                                    <item>Any official indication at this time, or during the course
                                        of the negotiations, that the U.S. intends to increase
                                        substantially its direct economic aid to the Philippines
                                        might have adverse repercussions as well as being
                                        economically undesirable. Anti-American elements in the
                                        Philippines and elsewhere could charge that the U.S.,
                                        unwilling to make outright trade concessions to the

                                        agreement which would be acceptable in the United States.
                                        From a political standpoint, both Magsaysay and ourselves
                                        might lose more than we could gain under such circumstances.
                                        Moreover, economic aid in lieu of economically sound trade
                                        agreement revisions would be highly questionable on economic
                                        grounds and would certainly not be economically beneficial
                                        to the Philippines.</item>

                                    <item>We should express the above opinion very frankly to Laurel
                                        and two or three members of his delegation. At the same
                                        time, the Philippines should be told that the U.S.
                                        representatives understand the problems of the Philippine
                                        mission and intend to do everything possible to bring about
                                        an agreement which among other things would at least for the
                                        time being provide the Philippines with resources for
                                        economic development purposes. The policy which the <pb

                                        might follow to bring that about might represent a
                                        compromise between the extreme Philippine proposals for
                                        selective free trade (completely one-sided to the advantage
                                        of the Philippines) and the extreme American view. A formula
                                        might be developed which would start with an arrangement
                                        which would closely resemble the Philippine selective free
                                        trade idea and would be highly weighted in favor of the
                                        Philippines with the Philippine margin of advantage
                                        decreased progressively for a period of 10, 15, or 20 years,
                                        at which time arrangements of greater reciprocity would
                                        commence.</item>

                            <p>I believe that an arrangement along the line of (2) above might be
                                sold to Congress on the grounds that it was the best possible means
                                of assisting the Philippines to gain increasing economic strength
                                and thus be better able to resist Communism. It could be represented
                                as more effective assistance than an increase in direct economic aid
                                which otherwise might be necessary.</p>
                            <p>Langley felt that because of the importance of this matter, he should
                                bring it to your attention. He would like to have an opportunity to
                                discuss it with you briefly. I shall have some staff work done and
                                report again to you, at which time a conference with Langley might
                                be advisable.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador Romulo called today on Mr. MacArthur and on Mr. Robertson to
                            show them a copy of a telegram<note n="3" xml:id="d378fn3">Not

                            Magsaysay.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs was
                            being pressed by our Embassy in Manila to enter into the long delayed
                            negotiations on military bases at a very early date. The President is
                            greatly disturbed at the possible results of a resumption of
                            negotiations at this time for two reasons: (1) Because he believes that
                            further public attention to our position on the title issue, which he
                            states is extremely unpopular in the Philippines, would strengthen both
                            the opposition and the Communists; he refers to the Administration’s
                            recent military success against the Communist and fears that some of the
                            ground gained might be lost. (2) He believes that the opposition will
                            attempt, possibly with success, to convince the Philippine public that
                            we will be demanding military privileges in the Philippines in return
                            for agreeing to a satisfactory revision of the Trade Agreement. He
                            requested Ambassador Romulo to make his views known to the Department
                            and to urge that negotiations not be resumed at the present. The
                            telegram contained no indication as to when he thought negotiations
                            should start.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Robertson and Mr. MacArthur told the Ambassador that the President’s
                            message would receive our most careful attention, and that they would
                            wish to discuss the subject with the Secretary on his return next
                                Tuesday.<note n="4" xml:id="d378fn4">Nov. 30.</note> The Ambassador
                            said that he would inquire on the subject next Wednesday.</p>
                        <p>(Ambassador Spruance has informed us on several occasions that he has
                            discussed the resumption of negotiations with the President <pb n="644"

                        <p>General Romulo, at his request, called on Mr. Robertson this morning to
                            convey a message from President Magsaysay concerning culmination of the
                            Trade Agreement negotiations. General Romulo stated that he had been
                            instructed by President Magsaysay to request that the United States
                            agree to a revision of the Trade Agreement which would permit the Trade
                            Agreement Delegation to announce substantial benefits for the
                            Philippines.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Robertson stated that this matter had been recently discussed in the
                            Department and that we would make the greatest possible concessions to
                            the Philippines consistent with the necessity for obtaining
                            Congressional approval. Mr. Robertson pointed out that an agreement
                            which proved to be unacceptable to the Congress would be most
                            unfortunate. He reiterated that we would agree to help the Philippines
                            to the greatest extent possible with respect to changes in the Trade
                            Agreement and pointed out that General Romulo was probably better
                            qualified than most Americans to understand the problems involved.</p>
                        <p>General Romulo said that he appreciated Mr. Robertson’s position and that
                            he would convey Mr. Robertson’s views to President Magsaysay by
                            telephone tonight. He also said that he would explain our position to
                            members of the Philippine Delegation.</p>
                        <p>General Romulo raised the question of President Magsaysay’s visit to the
                            United States and stated that he had hoped there would be some time lag
                            between Magsaysay’s visit and visits of other distinguished foreigners.
                            Mr. Robertson explained the numerous difficulties in view of the large
                            numbers of distinguished foreigners who visit the United States and
                            stated that we wanted to be sure that any visit by Magsaysay was very
                            well planned so that he would receive all the appropriate courtesies and
                            honors. He said that he felt anything less would be worse than no visit
                            at all. General Romulo was in agreement. He also stated that he felt
                            Magsaysay <pb n="646" xml:id="pg_646" facs="0666"/>should visit the
                            United States while the Congress was in session.<note n="1"

                                    Laurel to discuss the Trade Agreement and Philippine claims. On
                                    the first topic, no new ground was covered; on the second,
                                    Cuthell’s memorandum of conversation on the meeting reads:</p>
                                <p>“On the claims question, Mr. Robertson said that we were actively
                                    investigating the 1934 devaluation claim, and would continue to
                                    discuss it with the Treasury. It was noted that favorable action
                                    would, of course, require a Congressional appropriation. A long
                                    and inconclusive discussion of the war damage claim followed,
                                    which was terminated by Senator Laurel’s suggestion that this
                                    claim and those relating to the Army be reviewed subsequently by
                                    representatives of the Department and the Philippine Embassy in
                                    Washington. The Senator stated that his primary interest was in
                                    seeing that his Government had an opportunity to present all the
                                    evidence in its possession on each of these claims and that it
                                    have an opportunity of discussing it with this Government. Mr.
                                    Robertson agreed that discussions should proceed as the Senator
                                    desired and as anticipated by his letter to the Senator of

                                    on Aug. 1, 1955, enacted the Philippine Trade Agreement Revision

                        <p>As both of you are aware, I have for a long time had considerable doubts
                            concerning (a) the precise objectives of, (b) the wisdom of maintaining,
                            and particularly, (c) the wisdom of maintaining at such high levels, the
                            military assistance program for Thailand. Recent reports to the effect
                            that arms were being delivered from Thailand to the Karens<note n="2"

                            authorities were in touch with Chinese Communists in Hong Kong, together
                            with the recurrent participation over the past two years of the several
                            Thai services in military coups in support of different political
                            factions, have strengthened these doubts at least to the point of
                            believing that we should make a thorough reassessment of the purpose of
                            this program and the desirability, and, if so, at what level, of
                            continuing this program in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953 and

                        <p>I therefore request that the Departments of State and Defense collaborate
                            on a careful reassessment of the problem so that it may be available at

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Ohly</hi>: Reference is made to your
                            memorandum of August 12 addressed to Mr. Frank Nash, Department of
                            Defense, and me, regarding military assistance for Thailand. The
                            questions raised in your memorandum have been carefully studied and the
                            views of the Departments of Defense and State, together with the views
                            of their respective representatives in Bangkok, are coordinated in the
                            following observations:</p>
                        <p>Your memorandum questions the objectives of the military assistance
                            program for Thailand and the wisdom of maintaining a program at “such
                            high levels”. The memorandum also cites two unconfirmed reports: (1)
                            that arms are being delivered from Thailand to the Karens in exchange
                            for wolfram; (2) that certain Thai military authorities have been in
                            touch with Chinese Communists in Hong Kong, and also comments that the
                            Thai military have recurrently participated over the past two years in
                                <hi rend="italic">coups d’état</hi>, implying that United States
                            military aid has made such coups possible.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Recurrent Participation of the Thai
                                Military in Political Coups d’état</hi></p>
                        <p>I will discuss these subjects in inverse sequence. As a matter of fact,
                            the Thai military have been participating in <hi rend="italic">coups
                                d’état</hi> in the modern period since 1932, not merely during the
                            past two years. Although Thailand has all of the machinery necessary for
                            democratic government the Thai people have not learned how and perhaps
                            do not have the inclination to use it to the exclusion of other methods.
                            In their history they have been accustomed to absolute monarchy and the
                            replacement of one regime by another by means of force or a show of
                            force. Since 1932 this authoritarian form of administration has been
                            democratized to the extent of distributing the power among a small
                            powerful group rather than leaving it in the hands of a single monarch.
                            The various coups, therefore, represent regroupings within the dominant
                            group or efforts by political “outs” to displace those in power. Since
                            1932 Thailand has had something like a two-party system in that until
                            1947 two political aggregates competed for domination of the nation. The
                            aggregate led by the present Prime Minister, Phibun Songkram, has had
                            remarkable longevity in that it has maintained its <pb n="651"
                                xml:id="pg_651" facs="0671"/>political control without interruption
                            since 1947, although various attempts have been made by opposing
                            elements to overthrow it. At present the Phibun political organization
                            is in unquestioned domination and so far as can be seen there is no
                            possibility of any opposing political aggregate overthrowing the present
                            regime. However, there is constant competition within the Phibun-led
                            group for authority and status, so that there is always a possibility
                            that some elements within the party, perhaps by a show of military
                            force, will attempt to secure a higher position in the Government,
                            perhaps even seeking to displace Marshal Phibun. Even if such a
                            development should occur, essentially the same group will be in control
                            of the Government, which is friendly to the United States.</p>
                        <p>Incidentally, the individual who is most likely to lead a <hi
                                rend="italic">coup d’état</hi> at this time in order to displace
                            Marshal Phibun is General Phao, who is at the head of the Police Force
                            and whose Service is receiving no American military aid.</p>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing, it is believed that United States military aid
                            has not inspired political change by coup and in fact has not been an
                            important factor in any coup as no coup has been successful since the
                            beginning of U.S. military aid. Therefore, the participation of the Thai
                            military in internal politics should not be regarded as an important
                            factor in reaching a decision regarding United States military
                            assistance for Thailand.</p>

                            Thai source reported that General Phao and an unidentified associate
                            sent one army officer and possibly one police officer via Hong Kong to
                            Peiping in March; that these officers were believed to have made contact
                            with high Communist authorities seeking a compromise arrangement for

                                target="d384fn1">Not printed.</note> stated that it had been
                            reliably reported that General Phao had held secret meetings with the
                            well-known Communist Ari Liwira who is currently living incognito with a
                            police official in Kanburi. It may be significant that it was General
                            Phao of the Police who is in change of Thailand’s intelligence
                            operations whose agents have reportedly made these contacts. There is no
                            certainty that such contacts were actually made and the reports may have
                            emanated from his political enemies.… Furthermore, it should be
                            remembered that the <pb n="652" xml:id="pg_652" facs="0672"/>United
                            States Government is not the only government which has a vital concern
                            with current happenings in China. Thailand, itself, in its own behalf,
                            is vitally concerned with this subject and it would be reasonable to
                            expect that the Thai Government by some guile would attempt to send its
                            intelligence agents into China in order to secure a fresh report on
                            China’s internal affairs from the point of view of Thai intelligence
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>However, assuming the most cynical motives for General Phao’s alleged
                            action in sending his agents into China with the view of making
                            compromise arrangements for his own future political longevity, the
                            United States Government should, even so, not condemn the total position
                            of the Thai Government, which is openly giving every evidence of
                            friendly cooperation with the United States, because of the actions for
                            personal advantage of one individual of that Government.</p>

                                Delivered from Thailand to the Karens in Exchange for
                            Wolfram.</hi></p>
                        <p>An <gloss target="#t_AP1">AP</gloss> despatch filed in Singapore April 10
                            by a Mr. Goodyear, whose information derived from a visit in northern
                            Thailand in December 1951, stated that the Karens had seized a 600-ton
                            wolfram stockpile at the Mawchi Mines, half of which had already been
                            disposed of to private interests. The assumption was made that as the
                            current price in the United States for wolfram was $4,000 a ton, the
                            Karens should have a considerable amount of foreign exchange. An
                            additional assumption was made, because of their current needs, that
                            they would use this foreign exchange to purchase arms. It was further
                            assumed that as the wolfram was passing out of Karenni through Thailand
                            the Karens were securing arms from the Thai military.… Just how much
                            confidence should be put in a report of this nature which appeared in a
                            Burmese newspaper is uncertain. And furthermore, the equipment described
                            was not American but British in type. I have no doubt that what wolfram
                            the Karens have sold has passed through Thailand. I would not question
                            the idea that if Karens are selling wolfram some elements in the Thai
                            Police or Military are making personal profit at the expense of the
                            Karens, giving as little as possible in return for the wolfram. Even
                            supposing that some elements of the Thai Military are engaged in such
                            traffic it could hardly be very extensive because of the problem of
                            transporting heavy ore either on the backs of human carriers or by pony.
                            I do not feel that the Thai Government, as a government, should be
                            judged and evaluated for the behavior or misbehavior of minor elements
                            in its employ who are led on by personal cupidity.</p>

                                Military Assistance for Thailand.</hi></p>
                        <p>Since the beginning of U.S. military assistance our precise objectives
                            have been (1) to encourage Thailand to continue on its present political
                            course of alignment with the Free World and to remain a stable force in
                            southeast Asia; (2) to assist the Thai Armed Forces in improving
                            internal security and, by increased defense strength, deterring external
                            aggression; (3) to bolster internal political stability and to help
                            check Communism by strengthening the Thai Government. It is believed
                            that these objectives are being achieved and that any move to
                            discontinue U.S. military assistance to Thailand would threaten the very
                            substantial progress which has been made.</p>
                        <p>In connection with objective (1), Thailand has openly opposed the actions
                            of the Chinese Communist regime, has refused to recognize it
                            politically, continues to recognize the Chinese Nationalist Government
                            at Formosa, is fighting with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            forces in Korea, is sympathetic with and has given political recognition
                            to the Associated States of Indochina, and is cooperating in every
                            respect in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and in all of its
                            subsidiary organizations, most of which have their Far Eastern
                            headquarters at Bangkok. Further, under objective (1), Thailand is the
                            most stable force on the southeast Asian mainland and is a haven of
                            peace in the midst of troubled nations round about her. We should not
                            feel discouraged at the success of United States aid programs in view of
                            these achievements.</p>
                        <p>Although military aid to Thailand would not enable the country to
                            withstand open Chinese invasion, it will contribute to the overall
                            strength of non-Communist forces in southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>Thai forces are being welded into a small but efficient force capable of
                            coping with internal uprisings, guerrilla attacks, or carrying out
                            delaying action in the event of Chinese Communist attacks in force. The
                            Military Assistance Advisory Group has assisted the Thai Army in
                            establishing various training courses in small unit tactics, infantry
                            weapons, and automotive driving. Infantry and artillery officer courses
                            have also been organized and—probably more important—various automotive
                            maintenance courses have been established.</p>
                        <p>The Navy program has included two patrol craft, two frigates and six
                            Coast Guard Utility Boats as well as spare parts and miscellaneous
                            equipment for installation in Thai Navy vessels. Training has been
                            conducted for a limited number of officers in electronic maintenance,
                            sonar and radar operations thus increasing the ASW and minesweeping
                            efficiency of its vessels. Psychologically the program, although modest,
                            has assisted the forces in gaining a greater confidence. The morale of
                            naval personnel has improved <pb n="654" xml:id="pg_654" facs="0674"
                            />and the efficiency of the individual units has increased through
                            combat experience with United Nations’ forces in Korea.</p>
                        <p>The air program has converted a heterogeneous assortment of obsolete and
                            worthless aircraft into a <gloss target="#t_RTAF1">RTAF</gloss> with an
                            assembly of first line piston fighters and trainers. The flying training
                            establishment has been reorganized and patterned after the <gloss
                                target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> Training Command. Monthly flying time
                            has increased slightly over 1000% since pre-<gloss target="#t_MDAP1"
                                >MDAP</gloss> conditions existed. The Air University and its
                            technical schools have been reorganized, their courses revised and
                            teaching methods modernized. The maintenance, supply, communications and
                            ordnance sections of the <gloss target="#t_RTAF1">RTAF</gloss> have
                            been, or are being reorganized. The Air Installations Program has
                            accounted for the completion of four new hangars at <gloss
                                target="#t_RTAF1">RTAF</gloss> bases, control towers, parachute
                            drying towers, and ramp facilities under construction. Contracts have
                            been let for resurfacing airfields at Tac Lee, Koke, Kathieni and
                            Korat.</p>
                        <p>There might be very serious effects upon Thailand’s political alignment
                            and upon the usefulness of the present American Ambassador and his staff
                            at Bangkok if the military assistance program were to be diminished or
                            brought to a full stop at this time. It is not difficult to visualize
                            the effect on Thai troops in Korea if the United States Government
                            suddenly discontinued its military program in Thailand.</p>
                        <p>In regard to objective (3) it seems clear, because of the longevity of
                            the Phibun regime, that the country is more politically stable than at
                            any time since World War II, regardless of the constant rumors and
                            attempts at political coups which have been discussed previously. It is
                            further clear that there is no strong Communist movement among the Thai
                            and that any Communist threat within Thailand stems from the Chinese
                            community. Repeated reports indicate that the Thai Government is
                            completely confident in its abilities to control the Chinese community
                            and there has been no evidence to indicate their inability up to the
                            present in this respect.</p>
                        <p>The military programs for Thailand should continue at the presently
                            planned levels. A balance has been achieved between the amount of
                            equipment and services furnished and the ability of the Thai forces to
                            absorb it, hence any augmentation of the present levels would constitute
                            a wastage. On the other hand, the programs should not be reduced since
                            any reduction would promote a reaction in Thailand favorable to
                            Communist propaganda, and perhaps create the impression throughout
                            southeast Asia that the United States was abandoning support of an Asian
                            country which, at the <pb n="655" xml:id="pg_655" facs="0675"/>risk of

                                xml:id="pg_656" facs="0676"/>by Premier Phibun. Available info
                            suggests that while Phao has dragged feet in dealing with Commies,
                            Phibun in past few months has grown increasingly worried over extension
                            Commie activities and has repeatedly urged Phao take action. Some info
                            indicates that on night Nov 9 Phibun ordered a reluctant Phao directly
                            to follow up Prangphet’s arrest with broad sweep of pro-Commie
                            elements.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Basis present info indicates increase in
                            Phibun’s stature in govt over recent months. Therefore, these arrests
                            may be first important instance of genuine strong anti-Commie program
                            after four years of hollow promises.</p>
                        <p>During my call on <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> yesterday he
                            described recent developments as serious effort on part of Commies to
                            undermine govt. He said govt in possession conclusive evidence that Maj
                            Phrangphet and wife actually turning over maps, diagrams, other data
                            concerning air fields and milit installations to Sov Leg here. He said
                            it also established that AF officer in question working closely with
                            several Thai who govt believes have gone over to Commies. <gloss
                                target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> said he has felt serious concern
                            during past two months over increasing activities of Commies, especially
                            among it Buddhist priests and univ students, particularly students of
                            UMPS. In reply to my inquiry as to whether there was sufficient evidence
                            to prosecute all those arrested, <gloss target="#t_PriMin1"
                                >PriMin</gloss> replied he believed there was good evidence
                            concerning a number Thai who have been particularly active at recent
                            mtgs held in Bangkok in support so-called Peace Conf Peiping.</p>
                        <p>I also took opportunity calling <gloss target="#t_PriMin1"
                            >PriMin</gloss>’s attention to article which appeared yesterday in one
                            Gen Phao’s newspapers giving rather lengthy acct info said given by Phao
                            at mtg of members of govt legislative group re reasons for arrests
                            carried out by police during past few days. I called <gloss
                                target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>’s particular attn to passages
                            this news story in which Gen Phao referred to info said to have been
                            received thru Brit and US official channels and in which Phao implied
                            Brit and ourselves exerting pressure on Thai Govt and blaming him for
                            not taking action against Commie. News story also states that in reply
                            question put to him by one govt member Parliament as to whether or not
                            arrests made as result “dictation” by Brit and US, Gen Phao replied govt
                            not being dictated to but had been warned or advised to take action
                            since Thai was a partner in fight against communism. Phao also linked up
                            recent action taken by police with receipt of milit and econ aid. I
                            pointed out to <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> story this kind
                            might well give Thai people erroneous impression govt taking action
                            against Commies because of US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            pressure. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> replied story was
                            “not good” and then added that Phao had issued denial over radio last
                            night. Whatever real feelings and motives of Phao with respect to
                            growing Commie activities <pb n="657" xml:id="pg_657" facs="0677"/>in

                        <p>In Parliament Gen Phao led govt in presenting new strong anti-Commie law.
                            This action planned earlier was obviously stepped up as result recent
                            arrests. Reportedly draft bill not distributed to MPs till night Nov 12
                            and did not appear on agenda. Phao forced bill thru first, second, third
                            and last readings in one day despite normal thirty-day waiting
                            period.</p>

                        <p>1129. Further conversation yesterday with Prime Minister ref arrests
                            Commies and others said planning overthrow govt. He said arrests
                            continuing and now more Chinese than Thai in custody. In reply my
                            inquiry re evidence he said this based in part on documents seized by
                            police but more obtained from interrogations and confessions. Some
                            documents he said no doubt spurious .…</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister said to date indicated Commie plans were still in initial
                            stage but had been progressing steadily. On basis arrests made in
                            provinces it was evident Commies were having some success placing agents
                            in village and district administration plan being to stir up trouble in
                            provincial areas and lay foundation for take-over of govt in Bangkok.
                            Prime Minister also referred to recent telegram he claimed addressed to
                            Soviet Legation here from Commie China to effect <gloss
                                target="#t_ChiCommie1">Chi Commie</gloss> troops being infiltrated
                            into Indochina. He said this very serious if true but seemed to doubt
                            authenticity of message and said perhaps Soviet Legation deliberately
                            putting out false information. I suggested Prime Minister Govt <pb
                                n="658" xml:id="pg_658" facs="0678"/>might want issue statement on
                            whole matter but he said unwise do so while police still carrying on
                            investigation and making more arrests.</p>
                        <p>At conclusion interview Prime Minister referred to fact Direck Jayanama,
                            former Prime Minister in Pridi Govt, was named in papers turned up by
                            police <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> new govt. He said
                            laughingly Direck once before named <gloss target="#t_PriMin1"

                        <p>United States policy toward Thailand must be formulated and executed in a
                            manner which avoids the appearance of interferences in the internal
                            affairs of the kingdom. The Thai are a proud people who cherish their
                            long record of independence and freedom from foreign domination. There
                            is also a trend toward a more nationalistic outlook accompanied by
                            sensitivity toward allegations, such as the communists and the Burmese
                            make, that Thailand is the puppet of the United States. United States
                            relations with Thailand, including the implementation of the <gloss
                                target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_MAAG1"
                                >MAAG</gloss> programs, have been conducted on a cooperative basis
                            of equality. It is essential that the relationship be kept on this
                            basis.</p>
                        <p>Some criticism has been voiced that our policies, particularly the <gloss
                                target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_MAAG1"
                                >MAAG</gloss> programs, are strengthening undemocratic processes in
                            this country by helping to consolidate the position of the military
                            clique. It must be recognized that this is to some extent true.
                            Nevertheless, in view of the nature of the present internal situation,
                            especially the weakness and incompetence of the opposition elements and
                            their leftist and neutralist tendencies, I believe we must accept the
                            present locus of political power and work out our <pb n="659"
                                xml:id="pg_659" facs="0679"/>policies and objectives within its
                            framework, but encouraging at every opportunity more than mere lip
                            service to democratic process of government. I believe this can best be
                            achieved by endeavoring wherever possible to support and strengthen the
                            position of Prime Minister Phibun, who has not only displayed a most
                            friendly and cooperative attitude toward the United States but has also
                            proved the only personality able, in the circumstances, to maintain an
                            effective balance among the contending factions of the military clique
                            and at the same time restrain their excesses. Working as much as
                            possible through the Prime Minister seems to offer the best chance of
                            achieving our policies and objectives under the present regime. In
                            particular, we should endeavor wherever possible and feasible to
                            encourage the Thai Government in its present anti-communist action,
                            without, however, giving rise to the impression that this action on the
                            part of the Thai is the result of pressure from the United States, or
                            that we wholeheartedly support every phase of such action.</p>
                        <p>Thailand’s constructive role in the work of the United Nations,
                            especially Thai participation in the Korean action, has proved
                            advantageous for United States policies in Asia generally. Every effort
                            should be made by our Government to keep alive and encourage Thailand’s
                            interest in and constructive association with the United Nations. I
                            believe one effective way to achieve this end is to accord Thailand
                            greater recognition in the United Nations as opportunity arises.</p>
                        <p>In contrast to India, Burma and Indonesia, this country is interested in
                            any plan for the defense and security of Southeast Asia. But some
                            sensitivity has been shown among the Thai, and perhaps not unnaturally,
                            because of the fact that the Western Powers frequently confer about the
                            defense of the area without consulting them. A continuance of this
                            practice may well give rise to resentment and suspicion. Conversely, it
                            would also appear necessary for the United States to associate itself
                            closely with any Southeast Asia security arrangement which may evolve,
                            for if the United States remains aloof, the Thai will feel the
                            arrangement lacks real strength and be reluctant to participate
                            themselves.</p>
                        <p>Any action the United States can take to assist the French and Associated
                            States in liquidating the communist problem in <gloss target="#t_Indo1"
                                >Indo</gloss>-China would, of course, have a favorable bearing on
                            our relations with the Thai. At the same time, however, the more we can
                            encourage the French to accord the Associated States greater autonomy,
                            the more we can expect a friendly rapport between them and Thailand.</p>
                        <p>A solution of the problem posed by the presence of Chinese Nationalist
                            remnants in the Shan States is urgently needed to give <pb n="660"
                                xml:id="pg_660" facs="0680"/>our relations with Thailand a more
                            favorable context in the eyes of the Burmese and other Asiatics, and, at
                            the same time, to remove an open sore which at present jeopardizes good
                            relations not only between Thailand and Burma but of course between
                            Burma and the United States.</p>
                        <p>The present trend of relations between Thailand and Japan is providing a
                            favorable pattern for our general policy of encouraging Japanese trade
                            with Southeast Asia the development of Japanese industrial enterprises
                            in this area to offset pressure for a resumption of economic if not
                            political relations with Communist China. While it is highly desirable
                            to encourage this development, we must be prepared to face some
                            resentment and opposition on the part of other countries doing business
                            with Thailand, particularly the United Kingdom, as well as from some of
                            our own business interests who feel the pinch of stiff Japanese
                            competition in Southeast Asia markets and who resent United States
                            encouragement of Japanese trade at their expense.</p>
                        <p>I would most strongly recommend that there be no abrupt change in our
                            military and economic aid programs in Thailand. These programs have been
                            successful in proving Thailand’s general security position, in
                            demonstrating an interest in the welfare of an ally and in developing
                            the country’s economy and its capacity to provide rice for the
                            food-deficit areas of Southeast Asia and the Far East. With respect to
                            the economic aid program, however, I believe it is necessary in the
                            interests of making the maximum use of available funds to phase out most
                            if not all the small projects and concentrate our attention on our major
                            objectives, namely, agricultural development, public health and
                            communications, all of which have a vital bearing on increasing rice
                            production, and the health and welfare of the Thai people but which at
                            the same time contribute to the defensive strength and security of the
                            country.</p>
                        <p>The Fulbright program in Thailand has proved most beneficial in promoting
                            a friendly understanding of the United States and raising educational
                            standards in this country. It should not only be continued for the
                            projected five year period, but funds should be earmarked for extending
                            the program for an additional five years.</p>
                        <p>The work of <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> in Thailand has been of
                            paramount importance in counteracting communist propaganda and
                            neutralist trends. Unlike some other countries, <gloss target="#t_USIS1"
                                >USIS</gloss> is able to operate here in a friendly environment and
                            on a nationwide scope. Accordingly, any increase in its operating funds
                            and facilities can be put to direct and immediate use.</p>
                        <p>Since the fostering of more cordial relations between the countries of
                            Southeast Asia and a better understanding of common problems,
                            particularly the problem of communist expansion, are so <pb n="661"
                                xml:id="pg_661" facs="0681"/>important, I have been endeavoring to
                            convince Thai Government leaders of the desirability and wisdom of
                            taking appropriate steps. The response has been encouraging. The
                            Government has sanctioned the appointment of ministers to each one of
                            the Associated States and to Indonesia and an ambassador to Burma. It is
                            hoped that Thailand’s relations with her immediate neighbors will
                            improve and that the joint consideration of common problems will not
                            only be facilitated but become common practice. The Prime Minister also
                            announced his desire to initiate a program for the exchange of students
                            with neighboring countries. In the field of military defense and
                            security the Thai are cooperating well with the British along the
                            Thai-Malay border, while we are encouraging the idea of joint
                            Thai-British naval and air maneuvers. The Thai have also sent several
                            military missions to neighboring countries including <gloss
                                target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>-China. These developments represent a
                            greater awareness on the part of the Thai Government of the existence of
                            common problems and common dangers. We should, I feel, encourage not
                            only the Thai Government but the governments of the surrounding
                            countries towards a greater degree of understanding and cooperation.</p>
                        <p>It is finally necessary to consider the overall impression given to other
                            countries by the friendly and cooperative relationship which has been
                            developed between Thailand and the United States. In general, this
                            friendly relationship affords a favorable example for our dealings with
                            other Asiatics. Nevertheless, Thailand has in effect assumed some of the
                            characteristics of a protege. The Communists, of course, go much further
                            and charge that Thailand has become an American puppet or satellite.
                            Even the Burmese take a somewhat similar attitude which no doubt exists
                            in varying degree among some of the other neutralist countries. This is
                            perhaps an inevitable consequence of our friendly relationship with the
                            Thai, but it is necessary to recognize the disadvantages and pitfalls
                            which are inherent in such a situation. The most serious danger lies, I
                            believe, in the reaction of the Thai themselves. While they are eager
                            and grateful for the material assistance and friendship we accord them,
                            they are also extremely sensitive to suggestions or charges that they
                            are under our tutelage. In the implementation of our policies toward
                            Thailand, therefore, we must not give the impression that we are
                            exerting pressure on the Thai by virtue of the aid extended for this
                            will inevitably undermine the friendly relationship that exists between
                            the two countries. That relationship is a definite asset to the United
                            States for it is really remarkable that this small country surrounded by
                            turmoil and exposed to communist aggression should so openly side with
                            us.</p>

                            under actual combat.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister asked me inform US Government this critical shortage of
                            ammunition and convey his earnest hope that in view gravity situation
                            facing Thailand a 60 days supply small arms ammunition could be rushed
                            to Thailand. I have discussed matter with chief <gloss target="#t_MAAG1"
                                >MAAG</gloss> and his officers who confirm Thai arms stocks of
                            ammunition are totally inadequate and ammunition thus far furnished with
                                <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> equipment has been scarcely

                            that to refuse at this critical juncture would shake Thai Government and

                            days ammunition reserve for defense of position (per paragraph 112 A
                            field manual 101–10 dated August 49) based on weapons programmed through

                            cases additional ammunition is required for instance where 56m–24 tanks

                        <p>The Thai Ambassador, Pote Sarasin, called by appointment in order to
                            inform the Secretary of various problems faced by his Government as a
                            result of the Viet Minh invasion of Laos. He indicated that his
                            Government had ordered strict enforcement of the closure of the frontier
                            which has in theory been closed for a long time; that police and
                            military reinforcements had been ordered to the border provinces; that
                            an air patrol of the frontier had been established; that Vietnamese
                            refugees of political inclination were being evacuated from northeastern
                            Thailand where they have been residing for the past five years; that the
                            Thai Government will firmly defend its territory; .…</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador went on to say that he had been instructed to tell the
                            Secretary that it would be very reassuring if he would make a strong
                            statement on the Laos situation, mentioning the danger to Thailand, the
                            importance of Thailand in the resistance of the Free World against
                            Communist aggression and some indication of United States and United
                            Nations support in case Thailand is attacked.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary immediately incorporated a sentence or two in an address
                            which he will make on Thursday<note n="1" xml:id="d390fn1">On May 7,
                                Secretary Dulles spoke briefly about the international situation
                                before the New York State Republican dinner in New York. After
                                referring to the invasion of Laos, he continued: “These armed
                                aggressors now also threaten peaceful Thailand (Siam). Thailand is
                                one of the nations which, showing its faith in collective security,
                                has gallantly and substantially contributed to the <gloss

                            and said that he would <pb n="665" xml:id="pg_665" facs="0685"/>seek an
                            opportunity before leaving the United States to make a more
                            comprehensive statement.</p>
                        <p>The Thai Ambassador then asked what possibility there was of the United
                            Nations taking up the Laos situation saying that the Thai Government and
                            nation would accept a United Nations resolution as a basis for their own
                            policy decisions and action. The Secretary said that until now it was
                            chiefly the responsibility of the French Government to raise the
                            question of Laos in the United Nations but that it had not done so for
                            reasons of its own. He then read Article 34 of the United Nations
                            Charter and advised the Thai Ambassador of the desirability of Thailand
                            bringing the question itself before the United Nations Security Council
                            as a preventive measure pointing out that it would focus the attention
                            of the world on Thailand’s position and might act as a deterrent to
                            Communist forces. He added that an appeal brought before the United
                            Nations after the act of aggression would be somewhat tardy in that the
                            damage would have been done. The Thai Ambassador was very favorably
                            impressed with this suggestion and said that he would strongly recommend
                            that his Government do so.</p>

                            expedited on the grounds that transpiring events in Laos would result in
                            establishing a hostile armed force of communists along Thailand’s
                            northeastern frontier, and that such forces might find support among the
                            three to four million Lao in north and northeastern Thailand, the latter
                            area being further made hazardous by the presence of about fifty

                            specific items for Army, Navy and Air Forces which were most urgently

                            raising the level of Thailand’s priority if not to a level with
                            Indochina then at least to a point approaching that level for the

                                <item>Thailand is an essential element in the front against the
                                    advance of communism in southeast Asia. The principal communist
                                    objective after Laos would logically be Thailand, and this fact
                                    in itself requires a re-examination of Thailand’s military

                                        borders which may be expected to become more dangerous with
                                        the approach of communist forces on the northeastern border,
                                        and accordingly the Thai Government needs to be militarily
                                        strong to police them. The largest communist element is
                                        Chinese. In 1952 the Thai Government arrested over 900
                                        alleged communists, mostly Chinese. About forty-two of these
                                        have been formally charged with conspiracy. The Chinese
                                        dominate the economic life of Thailand and are in a position
                                        to damage the nation seriously if organized and determined
                                        to do so. Another aspect of the Chinese threat occurs in the
                                        southern provinces along the Malay border where disturbed
                                        conditions are caused by Chinese communist guerrillas which
                                        enter Thailand to escape British forces in Malaya.</p>

                                        consists of Vietnamese whose numbers are estimated at about
                                        50,000, most of whom are refugees from Indochina and who are
                                        believed to be sympathetic to the Viet Minh and if given an
                                        opportunity would provide support to Viet Minh forces.</p>

                                Thailand</hi></p>
                        <p>The Director of Central Intelligence<note n="2" xml:id="d392fn2">Allen W.
                                Dulles.</note> stated that the latest reports on the situation in
                            Laos were slightly more optimistic, though <pb n="668" xml:id="pg_668"
                                facs="0688"/>the situation was far from clear. The rainy season
                            would commence within a week or ten days, and would probably put an end
                            to the fighting until next autumn.</p>
                        <p>On the political side, continued Mr. Dulles, the recent statements and
                            actions of the King of Cambodia<note n="3" xml:id="d392fn3">Norodom
                                Sihanouk.</note> were the most significant developments. The King
                            had bluntly stated that the French must give Cambodia virtually complete
                            independence if they expected the Cambodians to assist in resisting the
                            Vietminh invaders.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Dulles then stated that Thailand had asked for assistance from the
                            United States, .… the Thai ground forces, numbering some 45,000 men,
                            were fairly good fighters. There was an air force of some 10,000 men and
                            300 aircraft, many of which aircraft were obsolete. The Thai navy was of
                            relatively little account. The major difficulty with the Thai army, said
                            Mr. Dulles, resulted from the involvement of its high-ranking officers
                            in politics. The rank and file were good.</p>
                        <p>General Bradley<note n="4" xml:id="d392fn4">General of the Army Omar N.
                                Bradley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</note> observed that
                            the involvement of Thai Generals in politics did not seem to him to make
                            them unique.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Cutler also read the statement of policy on Thailand with particular
                            reference to military assistance, noting that under this policy it would
                            be appropriate to increase U.S. military aid to Thailand.<note n="5"

                        <p>Secretary Smith<note n="6" xml:id="d392fn6">Under Secretary of State
                                Walter Bedell Smith.</note> said that the situation in French
                            Indochina had developed so rapidly that his staff in the State
                            Department has been unable to keep up with them. It was certainly clear,
                            however, that the situation in Thailand differed fundamentally from that
                            in Indochina. Secretary Smith confirmed that the Government of Thailand
                            had formally requested increased military assistance, and noted that the
                            Government had already begun to move certain disaffected and
                            pro-Communist elements from the border areas adjacent to Laos. Secretary
                            Dulles had written to Secretary Wilson<note n="7" xml:id="d392fn7"><ref
                                    target="#d391"><hi rend="italic">Supra</hi></ref>.</note> urging
                            the provision of additional military assistance, particularly
                            ammunition. This was all very desirable, said Secretary Smith, but what
                            the United States really ought to do to meet the situation in Thailand
                            was to send out a high-ranking general officer to head a small military
                            mission along the lines of General Van Fleet’s mission <pb n="669"
                                xml:id="pg_669" facs="0689"/>to Greece.<note n="8" xml:id="d392fn8"
                                >Gen. James A. Van Fleet, <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>
                                (ret.), served as Director of the Joint U.S. Military Advisory and
                                Planning Group in Greece, 1948–1950.</note> At present we have only
                            a Colonel in Bangkok, and while he was competent it was clear that the
                            Thais wanted a general officer who would direct and coordinate the
                            training of their armed forces. Much could be done if we would accede to
                            this request.</p>
                        <p>In answer to a question from the President, as to the availability of
                            arms and ammunition at short notice, General Bradley replied that a
                            certain amount could shortly be got to Thailand quickly, but that the
                            Thais wanted a good deal more than we had planned to send up to now.
                            General Bradley then read some of the details of these requests for
                            matériel.</p>
                        <p>Pointing out the very great possibilities of the loss of French
                            Indochina, Secretary Smith observed that we might still be able to hold
                            Thailand and the Kra Isthmus. We ought therefore to do our utmost to
                            meet the Thai requests.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Cutler inquired whether there would be any possibility of getting
                            General Van Fleet<note n="9" xml:id="d392fn9">General Van Fleet had
                                recently retired after serving as Commander of the U.S. Eighth Army
                                in Korea, April 1951–February 1953.</note> to head the military
                            mission which Secretary Smith had outlined.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Smith said that the selection of General Van Fleet would have a
                            very powerful psychological effect, but the President expressed doubt as
                            to the likelihood that General Van Fleet could be persuaded to go.</p>
                        <p>The President also inquired into the nature of the <gloss
                                target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> program for Thailand and whether it
                            contemplated amounts of matériel sufficient to meet the demands of the
                            situation, and if not, whether there was sufficient flexibility in the
                                <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> program to permit transferring
                            to Thailand arms and munitions earmarked for other areas. The President
                            thought it inadvisable to seek new Congressional appropriations, in view
                            of the urgency of the matter and in view of General Bradley’s statement
                            that aid programmed for Thailand would not cover all that they were now
                            asking for. The President also suggested that General Bradley consider
                            possible candidates to head the military mission to Thailand which was
                            obviously the view of the Council and himself that we should send. The
                            President also directed General Bradley to call General Van Fleet to see
                            if there was any possibility of his being willing to go.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President raised the question as to whether publicity should not
                            be given to the assistance we propose to render Thailand.</p>
                        <pb n="670" xml:id="pg_670" facs="0690"/>
                        <p>The President said he agreed with General Smith that it was unwise to
                            give any publicity to what we were proposing to do for Thailand until
                            the assistance had actually materialized, on the ground that nothing
                            would be worse than to make a lot of noise about what we were proposing
                            to do, and then failing to do it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Jackson inquired whether it would not be sensible to look into what
                            could be done by way of psychological warfare with Thailand as a
                            base.</p>
                        <p>The President directed Mr. Jackson to consider this matter and report on
                            it to the Council at its next meeting.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary invited the Thailand Ambassador, Pote Sarasin, to call in
                            order to inform him of various actions and views arrived at in the U.S.
                            Government subsequent to receiving the information and comments of the
                            Ambassador on May 5. The Secretary handed the Ambassador an <hi

                            requested by the Thai Government was already enroute; that the U.S.
                            Government was prepared to send a high ranking officer with a special
                            accompanying Mission to become Chief of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1"
                                >MAAG</gloss>; that if the Thai Government was agreeable to such
                            appointment it would be expected that such officer would receive
                            complete cooperation from the Thai Government and Thai military
                            authorities comparable to the cooperation granted to such officer and
                            Mission in Greece during its period of crisis when the U.S. officer
                            acted as extraordinary Adviser whose opinion carried great weight and
                            who had a seat on the Supreme Council: that it would appear to be
                            advantageous from the Thai viewpoint to bring before the United Nations
                            the threat to the security of Thailand posed by the approach of Viet
                            Minh forces through Laos, as consideration of the problem in the United
                            Nations would lead to fuller appreciation in the Free World of the
                            desirability of rendering assistance to Thailand and would help
                            discourage Viet Minh aggression. The <hi rend="italic">Aide-Mémoire</hi>
                            went on to suggest that Thailand might wish to ask the Security Council
                            under Articles 34 and 35 of the Charter to find that the situation along
                            its northeastern frontiers endangered international peace and security
                            and that one line of action might be to request the appointment of a
                            Sub-committee of the Peace Observation Commission which would send
                            observers to border areas of Thailand to report on activities which
                            might threaten Thai independence or territorial integrity.</p>
                        <pb n="672" xml:id="pg_672" facs="0692"/>
                        <p>The Secretary emphasized the importance of prompt action by Thailand not
                            only to protect itself within its own borders but to bring the matter
                            before the United Nations as he believed that the maximum benefits might
                            be derived by such action. He explained that the proposal to send a high
                            ranking U.S. officer to become Chief of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1"
                                >MAAG</gloss> would be valuable only if he were given the utmost
                            cooperation and if he were included in all high military planning in
                            connection with the current crisis. He pointed out that the United
                            States Armed Forces have highly capable combat officers who have had
                            wide experience during World War II and in Korea and that the advice of
                            such an officer could be invaluable. The Secretary added that from
                            reports given him it appeared that the Thai Armed Forces were capable of
                            handling the situation which appears to be developing and that our hope
                            would be that the high ranking U.S. officer would be in a position to
                            provide expert advice drawn from his actual combat experience which
                            would make Thai Armed Forces most efficient.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the shipment of small arms ammunition, the Ambassador was
                            informed that certain categories of light ammunition were already in the
                            air and should be in Bangkok within 48 hours; that other categories were
                            already being loaded on ship in the Pacific Area and should arrive
                            within a week and that other heavier categories would follow promptly.
                            Reference was made to urgently needed military items for the Army, Navy
                            and Air Force which had also been requested and the Ambassador was
                            informed that many of these items were already being prepared for
                            shipment.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador appeared moved by the Secretary’s remarks and said that
                            his Government deeply appreciated such rapid consideration of its
                            problems; that he had already asked his Government its views on the
                            possible designation of a high ranking U.S. military officer as Chief of
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and the desirability of
                            raising the question of Thailand’s danger in the United Nations. He
                            added that he felt confident his Government would welcome a high ranking
                            U.S. military officer as Chief of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>,
                            and that Thai officials at the United Nations were already drafting
                            necessary materials to be used as soon as instructed by Bangkok.<note

                                    with the General, and that the Thai Government was considering
                                    bringing the matter of the invasion of Laos before the United
                                    Nations. (792.5/5–1953)</p>

                            that a democratic free nation such as the United States could act
                            quickly to assist a friendly government against unjustified

                                been ended as a consequence of the recent Viet Minh incursion into

                                considerably increase Communist capabilities for subversion and for

                                Thai leaders will increase proportionately, and they will almost
                                certainly request assurances of increased support from the
                                US.</item>

                            <item>While we believe that invasion of Thailand by regular Viet Minh
                                forces is not likely during the period of this estimate, the
                                situation would be drastically altered if the Communists should
                                consolidate a position on Thailand’s borders and threaten to invade
                                Thailand in force. In that event, the resistance Thailand would make
                                to the Communists would depend on whether Thailand’s leaders
                                believed sufficient external assistance could be counted on.
                                Specifically, they would demand a US commitment to support and
                                defend Thailand. If they were given such a commitment and were
                                convinced that US help would be immediate and effective, we believe
                                that the Thai leaders would stand firm against Communist pressures.
                                If, on the other hand, it did not appear that the necessary amount
                                of US aid would be forthcoming, Thailand’s leaders would probably
                                yield to Communist demands.</item>

                        <p>Having perused the above mentioned paper, I would endorse “Phase I”,
                            which proposes in coordination with U.S. military programs, <pb n="678"
                                xml:id="pg_678" facs="0698"/>to consolidate Thailand as a secure
                            base, by increasing its strength and making its frontiers more
                            defensible. This, in essence, is what the U.S. Government has been doing
                            in Thailand during the past two and one-half years through the extension
                            of military and economic assistance to Thailand .…</p>
                        <p>With respect to a military assistance program, I believe that the Thai
                            economy and finances will not support any great increase in the military
                            aid which has been planned and which is now in process of being
                            implemented. Every effort should be made, however, to expedite shipment
                            of military equipment which has been programmed, particularly artillery,
                            and to assign without delay the additional personnel requested by <gloss
                                target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, Thailand, in order to expedite the
                            training of the Thai Armed Forces. The assistance being extended by our
                            Government to the Thai Police should not be overlooked. To meet the
                            threat to Thailand’s frontiers occasioned by the Communist invasion of
                            Laos, the strength of the Thai Police is being increased by some 5,000
                            men, .…</p>
                        <p>With respect to our economic aid, I feel, on the basis of conversations
                            with the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister, and other members of the
                            Cabinet, that the Thai Government does not desire any great increase
                            over and above the level of aid which has been extended during the past
                            two years. In fact, the Thai Government finds the setting aside of
                            counterpart funds a very considerable burden and is an obligation which
                            it would like our Government to waive. I believe, therefore, that it
                            would not be advisable to increase economic aid except for such
                            emergency projects in northeastern Thailand as may be agreed upon. It
                            should be borne in mind that the economic assistance which we have
                            extended to Thailand is not of such a nature as materially to lessen the
                            financial burdens incurred by the Thai Government in connection with
                            expenditures for military purposes. The only exception to the foregoing
                            is the assistance which <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> can give
                            with respect to highways.</p>
                        <p>The psychological objectives listed under “Phase I” have also received a
                            great deal of attention and through information programs, … the dangers
                            of Communism have been brought home to the Thai people and their will to
                            resist either Communist aggression or Communist blandishments has been
                            stimulated.… there is still much which can be accomplished by the
                            extension of informational activities to the provinces. However, this
                            can only be achieved through an increase of personnel, preferably
                            personnel having at least a basic knowledge of the Thai language, and
                            through increased appropriations.</p>

                        <p>Let us strengthen Thailand itself in every possible way and thus

                            in the future, but let us not embarrass our Thai friends and cause the

                        <p>The Under Secretary invited the Thai Ambassador to call and referred to a

                                xml:id="d397fn2">July 17.</note> regarding the designation of
                            General William J. Donovan to be Ambassador to Thailand. The Ambassador
                            was reminded that he had been asked to secure the frank views of his
                            Government on an informal and unofficial basis because of the unusual
                            wartime relationship between General Donovan, in his official capacity,
                            and certain Thai elements who at present are numbered among the
                            political opposition to the present government; that the Ambassador had
                            stated that his Government had no objection to the appointment; that the
                            appointment of General Donovan was far along on its course even to the
                            point where the General had already divested himself of any official
                            relations with his law firm; that it would be very embarrassing at this
                            late date to reconsider the subject and it was hoped that if a full
                            explanation were made to the Prime Minister giving full assurances that
                            General Donovan’s only purpose would be to support the present
                            Government and strengthen it in its anti-Communist stand, that the
                            appointment would be satisfactory to all concerned.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that it was true his Government, when asked, had
                            replied that it had no objection but that he had received personal
                            letters from high Government officials indicating great <pb n="680"
                                xml:id="pg_680" facs="0700"/>concern and he had consequently
                            expressed this concern on his own responsibility and without
                            instructions to Mr. Matthews. There then followed a lengthy discussion
                            regarding the pros and cons of the situation as it now stood, and it was
                            agreed that the appointment should go forward, that the Ambassador would
                            write a personal letter to the Prime Minister conveying the full
                            assurances of the United States Government, that General Donovan, on his
                            part, would make it a point upon arriving in Bangkok to associate
                            himself intimately with the Prime Minister and other high Thai officials
                            and would take care to disassociate himself from any arrangements which
                            might be identified with the political opposition. The discussion closed
                            on a very optimistic note and the hope was expressed on both sides that
                            the appointment would be of great profit in strengthening Thailand’s
                            position to potential Communist aggression.</p>

                            background statement respecting the situation in Thailand. He pointed
                            out that the Bangkok Government was firmly anti-Communist and strongly
                            pro-American. He warned, however, that this government was in fact a
                            military dictatorship which had come to power by a <hi rend="italic"
                                >coup d’état</hi>. Accordingly, it could reverse its pro-American
                            stand with little fear of public opinion. Inasmuch as the controlling
                            clique was very corrupt and Thailand was somewhat less prosperous than
                            in the past, an upheaval in the government could occur at any time. Such
                            internal weaknesses, continued General Cabell, would cause us little
                            concern were it not for the threat of foreign intervention posed by the
                            setting up of the Thai autonomous state and by the possible repetition
                            of the invasion of Laos by the Vietminh. On the occasion of the latter
                            event that Thai Government had at once sought commitments from the U.S.
                            for stronger support. General Cabell predicted that this move would be
                            repeated when the fighting season opens in Indochina. He further
                            predicted that Thailand would resist Communist demands only in so far as
                            its government received U.S. support. If such support were not
                            forthcoming, Thailand was likely to yield to Communist demands.</p>

                            and particularly with regard to the passage dealing with Indochina. He
                            said it should do much to discourage any thought of Chinese Communist
                            aggression there. There was a general exchange of views regarding the
                            current situation in Indochina with emphasis on the importance of the
                            efforts being made by our side to improve the situation politically and
                            militarily.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked in this connection—somewhat jocularly—that our
                            attitude toward the Thai project to raise the invasion of Laos in the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> might have appeared “vacillating”
                            but he pointed out that the situation itself had constantly changed and
                            that, due to a variety of circumstances, it had been difficult to come
                            firmly to grips with the French over this subject. Prince Wan expressed
                            understanding. He said that his government was ready to present its case
                            to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> should future circumstances
                            warrant. There ensued some inconclusive discussion of enemy intentions
                            during the coming fighting season.</p>
                        <p>Prince Wan then raised the question of the <gloss target="#t_KMT1"
                                >KMT</gloss> troops in Burma and expressed some optimism that
                            results were about to be <pb n="683" xml:id="pg_683" facs="0703"
                            />achieved. The Secretary agreed stating that he thought that through
                            the cooperation of Thailand and the US, a sincere demonstration had been
                            given the Burmese of the rather limited degree to which the situation of
                            these troops is subject to outside influences including that of the
                            Chinese Nationalist Government. It was generally agreed that a good part
                            of this problem, because of considerations of terrain and regional
                            associations transcending frontiers, remains outside of the area in
                            which outside influences can be effective.</p>
                        <p>Prince Wan introduced the subject of the presidency of the General
                            Assembly by stating that his candidacy was still alive and that he is
                            actively campaigning. The Secretary replied that we had been embarrassed
                            by the position which we had been obliged to adopt with respect to so
                            good a friend as Prince Wan and that we would be very happy if Prince
                            Wan should be successful.</p>
                        <p>After the conversation with the Secretary, Mr. Bonsal recalled to Prince
                            Wan that sometime ago we had endeavored to ascertain if Thailand was
                            interested in being a candidate for ECOSOC or for the Trusteeship
                            Council with a view to the possibility of our supporting the Thai
                            candidacy to either of these bodies. Prince Wan replied that he
                            appreciated our interest but that Thailand was not currently a candidate
                            for either ECOSOC or the Trusteeship Council. He said that in fact
                            Thailand had been approached by Pakistan with regard to ECOSOC and by
                            the Philippines with regard to the Trusteeship Council and that Thailand
                            planned to commit her vote for these vacancies rather than to be a
                            candidate herself. He gave Mr. Bonsal the impression that Pakistan and
                            the Philippines would receive the Thai support they had requested but a
                            final decision may not yet have been made. Prince Wan expressed
                            appreciation of our interest. He took occasion to say that India’s
                            concept of leadership was that India should be a candidate for
                            everything but that Thailand had other views of what constitutes
                            leadership.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Cutler refreshed the Council with regard to its previous actions with
                            respect to this problem, noting that the present report was the response
                            of the Psychological Strategy Board to the Council’s directive that its
                            original plan for psychological operations in Thailand be revised in the
                            light of the views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and of the Central
                            Intelligence Agency. Mr. Cutler also explained that the present plan for
                            Thailand was probably the last of its kind, since the Operations
                            Coordinating Board had now replaced <pb n="685" xml:id="pg_685"
                                facs="0705"/>the old <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> and would

                        <p>Mr. Cutler went on to explain the difference in function between the
                            Planning Board and the Operations Coordinating Board,<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d400fn5">The Planning Board formulated policy

                                coordinate the implementation of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                                policy.</note> pointing out that the present report was a relic of
                            earlier days when there had been widespread misconceptions about the
                            nature and purpose of psychological plans and strategy. He nevertheless
                            suggested that inasmuch as the present plan had been approved by the
                            high Government officials who composed the <gloss target="#t_PSB1"
                                >PSB</gloss>, it would be desirable that the Council approve the
                            plan if the earlier objections of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had been
                            removed by the changes which the <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> had
                            made. Mr. Cutler then asked Admiral Radford<note n="6" xml:id="d400fn6"
                                >Adm. Arthur W. Radford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
                                Staff.</note> to speak to this point.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Radford replied that he did not have a firm position on this
                            report from all three of the Chiefs. Their one remaining concern,
                            however, was that nothing that was proposed to be done in Thailand
                            should detract from our assistance to Indochina. This point, said
                            Admiral Radford, seemed to be so well met in the present revised plan

                        <p>Mr. Cutler then proposed approval of the present report but not to
                            include approval of the additional financial requirements set forth on

                                taking the place of Secretary Dulles, who had left earlier in the

                            objection to Phase I of the proposed plan, but warned that it might
                            raise questions as to the initiation of Phase II of the plan.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Wilson confirmed that the Defense Department was not completely
                            clear on this point either.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Cutler then inquired whether perhaps it would not be better to defer
                            approval of Phase II and approve only Phase I minus the additional

                        <p>Mr. Bowie then suggested an amendment to paragraph 2 which would clearly
                            indicate that any decision to initiate Phase II of the plan for Thailand

                        <p>In approving the action taken yesterday by the Council relative to U.S.
                            psychological strategy based on Thailand, the President asked me if
                            there was any one who was in charge of the various operations that were
                            being carried on between the United States and Thailand.</p>
                        <p>When I replied that this plan would be under the coordination of the
                            Operations Coordinating Board, he said that his question was addressed
                            not to planning and coordination in Washington, but to coordination and
                            control in the field.</p>
                        <pb n="687" xml:id="pg_687" facs="0707"/>
                        <p>Looking at the financial appendix, he saw that money was being spent by
                            the State Department, by the Defense Department, by <gloss
                                target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>, by <gloss target="#t_USIA1"
                                >USIA</gloss>, and by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. He wanted
                            to be sure that in the field we are not duplicating and tripping over
                            ourselves.</p>
                        <p>I told him that General Donovan had now been appointed Ambassador,<note
                                n="1" xml:id="d401fn1">Donovan was appointed Ambassador to Thailand

                                4.</note> and I supposed that he would have a very key position in
                            coordinating all of this work under the psychological strategy plan in
                            the field.</p>
                        <p>I think the President would like to be reassured about this some time at

                                        will remain seriously limited. The Thai Government is
                                        attacking this problem, but, because of economic
                                        difficulties, is restricted to a long term approach.</item>

                            <item>The first paragraph of my Letter of Instructions refers to “the
                                provision by the United States of a military mission to Thailand to
                                assist Thailand to develop the capability and will to resist the
                                Communist threat to that country.” Concerning that portion of the
                                sentence which relates to “will to resist” I believe as long as the
                                present government remains in power it may be assumed that this
                                “will to resist” is present in the heads of the government since a
                                change to a communistic form of government would sweep the present
                                government officials from the power and financial position they now
                                enjoy. So while in effect we are assisting a ruthless military
                                oligarchy maintain its position, we can be reasonably assured of its
                                “will to resist Communism.”</item>

                                    aggression is inadequate. These capabilities are increasing
                                    slowly, but in view of the seriousness of the existing threat
                                    and considering the value of U.S. matériel already invested in
                                    the Thai Armed Forces, a much more rapid development of

                                    required. This additional personnel could be provided at an
                                    insignificant cost to the U.S. contrasted with the matériel

                                    among the leaders and people of the country is dependent upon
                                    and varies directly with the ability of the Armed Forces to

                            the construction, under <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> supervision,
                            of an urgently needed segment of highway in Thailand which would link
                            the central plains system with that of the area adjacent to the scene of
                            Viet Minh aggression in Laos. The only connecting link at present is an
                            inadequate single-track railroad. This segment of proposed highway is
                            included in the five-year Thai Government highway scheme but several
                            years would elapse according to the plan under discussion between the
                            Thai Government and the International Bank before it would be

                            had discussed the project with you and had reached an understanding that
                            if State approved for political and psychological reasons and then

                            construction of the highway for military reasons. At this time <gloss
                                target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> desires the approval of the Departments
                            of State and Defense for planning purposes, as construction should be
                            launched during the current dry season if the project is finally
                            approved.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State has studied the question and has approved the

                                Defense considered that the construction of the highway would
                                enhance Thailand’s military capability and hence supported the

                                talked with the President the other day and he suggested that I talk
                                with you as to a question I raised. It concerned the request for
                                assurances by the government and the Crown of Thailand in the event
                                of an invasion. Our outpost lines in various parts of the world may
                                be looking for that now. I would be very grateful if you would give

                            Communists is essentially the common question of what our Government
                            will do when a friendly nation is attacked by Communists. The Secretary
                            expressed the views of our Government on this subject in an address
                            (copy enclosed) before the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City

                        <p>When we attempt to put out every fire built by the enemy at a time and
                            place chosen by him we proceed from emergency to emergency with the
                            initiative in the enemy’s hands. In the Secretary’s address he stated,
                            “The way to deter aggression is for the free community to be willing and
                            able to respond vigorously at places and with means of its own
                            choosing”. He also said, “Local defense will always be important. But
                            there is no local defense which alone will contain the mighty land power
                            of the Communist world. Local defense must be reinforced by the further
                            deterrent of massive retaliatory power”.</p>
                        <p>In connection with Thailand, it is important in your conversations with
                            the Government and the King to point out that aggression at some
                            particular place by the Communists, such as at Thailand, <pb n="705"
                                xml:id="pg_705" facs="0725"/>need not necessarily be met only or
                            even principally at that point. In the Secretary’s address he referred
                            to two areas of conflict, Korea and Indochina, and what he said there
                            has illustrative value which you might use in encouraging the Thai:
                            “This change (that is, a change of policy from fighting the enemy on an
                            emergency basis, letting the enemy pick his time and place of warfare,
                            to a policy of responding vigorously to aggression at times and places
                            of our own choosing) gives added authority to the warning of the members
                            of the United Nations which fought in Korea that if the Communists renew
                            the aggression, the United Nations’ response would not necessarily be
                            confined to Korea.”</p>
                        <p>“I have said, in relation to Indochina, that if there were open Red
                            Chinese Army aggression there, that would have ‘grave consequences which
                            might not be confined to Indochina’”</p>
                        <p>“All of this is summed up in President Eisenhower’s important statement
                            of December 26.<note n="3" xml:id="d413fn3">For text, see Department of

                            He announced the progressive reduction of the United States ground
                            forces in Korea. He pointed out that United States military forces in
                            the Far East will now feature ‘highly mobile naval, air and amphibious
                            units’; and he said in this way, despite some withdrawal of land forces,
                            the United States will have a capacity to oppose aggression ‘with even
                            greater effect than heretofore’”.</p>
                        <p>In your conversations with the Thai on this subject, after outlining our
                            policy of developing massive retaliatory power as a deterrent to
                            aggressors, it is equally important to underscore Thailand’s need to
                            reinforce its local defense as a further deterrent. The Thai should not
                            regard our policy and preparations as an opportunity to relax their own
                            efforts.</p>
                        <p>I am interested in your proposed trip to Indonesia and will look forward
                            to your comments.</p>

                            under instructions from his Government, informed him that the Government
                            of Thailand accepted the invitation to join in arranging for a united
                            front against Communist aggression as proposed by the Secretary,<note

                        <p>The Thai Ambassador asked the Secretary what the next move should be and
                            he replied that the immediate problem was to secure the agreement of the
                            other states in the area.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then referred to his forthcoming trip to London and Paris
                            and said that he would probably return to Washington on Monday the 19th
                            and depart Tuesday the 20th for Geneva. The Thai Ambassador inquired
                            whether he might see the Secretary on that Monday or Tuesday in order to
                            be fully informed of developments at London and Paris. The Secretary
                            replied that he, himself, would probably be too busy but he instructed
                            Mr. Landon to make the necessary arrangements so that the Thai
                            Ambassador might be informed fully on Monday the 19th before he,
                            himself, departed for Geneva on the 20th.</p>
                        <p>During the preparations of the press release the Under Secretary, General
                            Bedell Smith, came in and asked the Thai Ambassador whether his
                            Government had taken any action in Bangkok in line with their previous
                            conversation regarding the expansion of the Thai Armed Forces.<note

                        <p>The Thai Ambassador replied that his Government as yet had not discussed
                            this matter at Bangkok but that he knew the Prime Minister and other
                            high military officials in Thailand strongly favored increasing the
                            Armed Forces from about 60,000 to as much as 120,000; that they had
                            enough small arms; that, however, they lacked both trained men and the
                            necessary financial support for soft goods, barracks, and such
                            things.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary said that he believed the U.S. Government would
                            consider favorably at this time a firm request from the Thai Government
                            through the Chief of <gloss target="#t_JUSMAG1">JUSMAG</gloss>, General
                            Gillmore, and the Ambassador, General Donovan, for necessary support and
                            training for an army of about 90,000 men, including funds for soft
                            goods. He added that he had already discussed this with Admiral Radford
                            and other officials in our own military establishment and believed that
                            the same consideration might now be given Thailand that this Government
                            had given other nations in not limiting our aid to hard goods but
                            including also soft goods where necessary.</p>
                        <p>The Thai Ambassador assured the Under Secretary that he would inform his
                            Government immediately on this subject and believed <pb n="708"
                                xml:id="pg_708" facs="0728"/>that prompt action would be undertaken
                            in this respect at Bangkok.</p>
                        <p>The conversation ended on a very happy note with mutual
                            congratulations.</p>

                        <p>In considering additional military assistance to Thailand, the problem of
                            availability of funds must be faced. The losses that the <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1950–54 MDA Program has suffered to
                            non-MDA Programs (over half a billion dollars), the diversion from other
                            countries to increased support of the effort in Indochina, together with
                            the limited funds being requested for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1955, almost preclude any large scale buildup in Thailand. Any increase
                            of funds for Thailand can only be at the expense of other country
                            programs.</p>
                        <p>It is pointed out that the economy of Thailand, while the best of all
                            countries of Southeast Asia, is such that it cannot support a large
                            defense effort from its own resources. Any additional buildup will
                            inevitably create a demand for continuing budgetary support. It would
                            seem that at present the emphasis should be on increasing the quality
                            rather than the quantity of the Thai armed forces. However, the
                            realization of the proposal by the United States to form a collective
                            security alliance in Southeast Asia and the Pacific will, of course,
                            affect Department of Defense views.</p>
                        <p>This problem of additional assistance to Thailand is being referred this
                            date to the Joint Chiefs of Staff for their review and military advice
                            to the Secretary of Defense. You will be informed of the position of the
                            Department of Defense upon receipt and review of their military
                            advice.</p>

                            prepared as the initial base because of the minimum expense and effort

                        <p>Thailand has repeatedly indicated its desire for a mutual defense
                            agreement. The arrangements for a leased base agreement imply agreement
                            on mutual defense. There is attached a draft treaty of mutual
                                defense,<note n="2" xml:id="d418fn2">Not printed.</note> to which
                            has been stapled draft Article V (a) on page 2, providing for bases for
                            U.S. forces in Thailand. This paragraph was drafted separately as it is
                            possible to treat the two subjects of a mutual defense treaty and a
                            leased base agreement separately. With respect to Thailand and the
                            urgency of the present situation, it seems preferable to combine the
                            two. If this were done agreement would have to be reached subsequently
                            on the location of the bases and legal jurisdiction over American
                            personnel. The negotiation of this subsequent agreement might require
                            considerable time because of the technical questions involved.</p>

                        <p>With regard to fighter wing, it seems to me that the important thing is
                            to have a base and maintenance facilities in Thailand. Wing itself need
                            not be “immobilized” here. It could have alternate station, and in any
                            case air mobility is such that rotation of fighter wing in Thailand
                            would not necessarily immobilize it. I believe that any move toward
                            providing air power in Thailand would have great effect. The morale
                            factor of air bases and planes as against air bases alone is of highest
                            importance.</p>
                        <p>Overriding point is that we now have no air base in Southeast Asia and
                            that potentialities of acquiring air facilities there could well be
                            enormous, particularly since Philippine facilities have geographical and
                            possibly political handicaps.</p>
                        <p>Thai Ambassador is seeing me today. I believe his purpose is to discuss
                            strengthening of Thai potential and this will probably include the
                            matter of air bases. I intend to discuss these matters with him in
                            general and informal terms as authorized in <gloss target="#t_Tedul1"

                        <p>Ambassador Sarasin stated that he was interested in getting information
                            on his own behalf and that of Prince Wan regarding progress being made
                            on (a) the development of collective security arrangements in Southeast
                            Asia and (b) measures for strengthening the Thai armed forces. He said
                            he had been informed of the call which the Thai Chargé paid on the
                            Secretary on May 10th in Washington<note n="1" xml:id="d421fn1">See
                                Landon’s memorandum of conversation, <ref

                            which time it was the Chargé’s impression that progress on the united
                            action concept, at least so far as immediate implementation is
                            concerned, is held up by British unwillingness to go along at this
                            time.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador indicated a full awareness of the requirements of the Thai
                            armed forces in the matter of equipment and training. He said that a
                            certain amount of small arms had recently been received. He said that
                            the Thai Prime Minister is anxious to increase the Thai army from its
                            present strength of between 50 and 60,000 to a total of 150,000. The
                            manpower is readily available but there is the problem of training
                            cadres. There is also a financial problem. The Thai budget currently
                            amounts to $250 million of which the armed forces absorb over $100
                            million. The Thai financial situation is very tight. This was confirmed
                            by the International Bank recently when it refused to make a loan
                            requested by Thailand because of concern over Thailand’s public
                            finances. The Ambassador concluded with an appeal for a statement of the
                            extent to which US assistance <pb n="714" xml:id="pg_714" facs="0734"
                            />might be counted on in developing Thailand’s armed forces and
                            improving Thailand’s defense position.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary replied that while his information regarding programs
                            on military assistance to Thailand was not entirely current, he could
                            state that our <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> have been asked to
                            examine and make recommendations with regard to a program which would
                            include assistance in increasing the Thai army to 90,000; constructing
                            the Saraburi Highway and certain other matters including an air base.
                            The Under Secretary stated that his views had been requested and that he
                            was making favorable recommendations. He said that he thought that ways
                            and means would be found whereby existing resources might be made
                            available to help the Thai Government.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary added that he had most strongly recommended the
                            establishment in Thailand of an air base with fighter planes in the
                            event that the Thai Government should request the installation of such a
                            base. He stressed the top secret nature of this matter and the important
                            part which such a base could play in free world defense of Southeast
                            Asia against aggression.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary stated that, provided the necessary resources could
                            be made available, the concept of assistance to be rendered the Thai
                            Government in military matters would be broad and flexible. It would
                            include financial support in view of the state of the Thai budget and
                            assistance in the construction of housing and presumably in the
                            provision of certain types of infrastructure (roads and air fields). The
                            Under Secretary emphasized also the important assistance which we could
                            render in training Thai officers and noncommissioned officers. He
                            recalled the experience which the US Marine Corps has acquired in the
                            peculiar problems of jungle warfare with modern weapons.</p>

                            telegrams and letters have not been numerous since your return to
                            Bangkok I am sure that we have both been very active in pushing forward
                            our <pb n="715" xml:id="pg_715" facs="0735"/>various projects. I just
                            had a telephone call from Mrs. Catherine Savage and told her that I had
                            had two telegrams<note n="1" xml:id="d422fn1">Neither printed.</note>
                            from you mentioning her name and had written her a letter explaining the

                        <p>You asked about the navigational aids costing $600,000. <gloss

                            completed the technical arrangements and studies necessary and are now
                            in the process of designating the funds so that apparently these aids
                            should be arriving shortly.</p>
                        <p>I have been in frequent touch with Bill Godell<note n="3"

                            material and provided the background on this for Robert Murphy to
                            discuss with Under [<hi rend="italic">Deputy</hi>] Secretary Anderson of
                            Defense in an <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> meeting last
                            Wednesday, May 12. At that meeting Anderson and Murphy reached general
                            agreement to sound out the Thai Government. I drafted a telegram to you
                            and to Geneva and then went to Defense to get Anderson’s initial of
                            approval. I spent two hours with General Erskine,<note n="5"

                            the general subject of military assistance to Thailand. It seemed to me
                            that Anderson was ahead of his Joint Chiefs in willingness to provide
                            assistance as you requested to Thailand. Admiral Radford had strong
                            personal reservations in desiring not to “immobilize” essential military
                            equipment which he feels will be necessary for the kind of war which he
                            thinks we are heading into. While I was in Anderson’s office he got Bob
                            Murphy on the phone and we agreed on the telegram which I then drafted
                            to Bedell Smith at Geneva and to you “Eyes only” on this subject.<note

                            only for practical but for morale purposes. I am arranging to have this
                            telegram repeated to you “Eyes only” so that you will <pb n="716"

                        <p>You doubtless also noted the telegram I sent when your recommendation

                                    >footnote 3, Document 418</ref>.</note> in which I wrote that it
                            was urgently desired to move ahead on the highway and suggesting the
                            desirability of shaking the Thai loose and getting them to make their
                            formal request with any further substantive specifications necessary.
                            The Secretary himself raised this point. He further has asked the Thai
                            Chargé as to what is holding up the Thai Government’s request for an
                            enlarged Army.<note n="9" xml:id="d422fn9">Reference is to the Chargé’s

                            The Joint Chiefs are currently studying these questions and it is my
                            impression that they feel that the Thai Army cannot be increased because
                            of the lack of trained commissioned and non-commissioned officers. I
                            suppose, therefore, that the emphasis in General Gillmore’s
                            recommendations and in the Thai Government’s requests should bear on
                            this aspect of the problem. I have just received a letter addressed to
                            Mr. Murphy from the Deputy Secretary of Defense<note n="10"

                            indicating lack of funds for any large-scale build-up but adding that
                            the Joint Chiefs are studying the question. As you know, anything can be
                            done in Government if you have to do it if the world situation and
                            national policy demands that it be done, so I suppose that even though
                            there are no funds for some of these Thai projects they can be
                            discovered when the urgency is fully realized.</p>
                        <p>In Washington the Secretary has had several rounds of conversations with
                            the nine Ambassadors of the countries in Southeast Asia whom he hopes to
                            draw into his projected “united action”. So he is working with patience
                            on this project.</p>
                        <p>The question of action regarding Indochina at the United Nations is very
                            active right now and yesterday afternoon there was a large meeting in
                            the Secretary’s office to discuss this question. The Secretary is
                            reluctant to have Cambodia take the question before the United Nations
                            because he does not believe that Cambodia is fully independent and,
                            therefore, would lack popular and public appeal. He instructed that the
                            Thai Foreign Minister be sounded out on this question and a telegram
                            went off last night on this subject.<note n="11" xml:id="d422fn11"

                            the direction in which we seem to be moving; that is, not depending on

                            treaty, as the former would be an executive agreement while the latter
                            would have to run the gauntlet of the Senate and has much greater

                            method used to maintain mobility not to lose it. Some permanent party

                            Matthew B. Ridgway, Chief of Staff of the Army; and <pb n="719"

                            National Security Council. The meeting began with a brief discussion of
                            United States relations with Pakistan.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. Murphy then raised the question of the aid program to Thailand
                            referring to the possible development of a highway and increase in the
                            Thai army, the development of a militia force and the construction of an
                            air base in Northeastern Thailand. He asked Admiral Radford if the Joint
                            Chiefs had formulated their views on these proposals.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Radford said a paper was being prepared for the Joint Chiefs
                            which was not yet completed but their present thinking was as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>The Joint Chiefs did not favor the construction of an air base. In the
                            first place, this would involve a substantial expenditure of money as
                            elaborate concrete runways would have to be built. In the second place,
                            bases in this location are not considered necessary from a military
                            point of view.</p>
                        <p>General Twining confirmed Admiral Radford’s military estimate and pointed
                            out that in view of the short distances, if Indochina were lost, such an
                            air field would be literally under the guns of the enemy.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Radford also indicated that if we negotiated an agreement to
                            construct an air base the next question that would be asked would be
                            what are we going to use it for and in what circumstances. He implied
                            there was no easy answer to this question.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the possible expansion of the Thailand army, Admiral
                            Radford indicated that General Gilman had reported that it would take
                            two years to train officers and NCO’s for the existing army of 60,000.
                            Therefore, any larger force would be impractical at this time.…</p>
                        <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>With respect to the highway development, Admiral Radford stated this was
                            an <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> project and that the Joint Chiefs
                            would probably have no objection to its construction.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Landon referred to the possibility of developing the air base at
                            Korat or to the construction of one considerably further south. He
                            suggested that a base in the latter area might be less expensive,
                            especially as the rainy season there was short.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Murphy said he thought Ambassador Donovan had discussed this when he
                            was in Washington recently and that he had been <pb n="720"
                                xml:id="pg_720" facs="0740"/>under the impression the Air Force was
                            interested in the possibility of building an air base in Thailand.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Radford said the Joint Chiefs felt certain that if the money was
                            available to build another base a better location could be found. The

                            and if Indochina were lost they did not believe operations could be
                            conducted from Burma to Thailand.</p>
                        <p>General Twining said he did not believe Mr. Landon’s point with respect
                            to the possibility of constructing a less elaborate and cheaper base was
                            sound since any base would have to be up-to-date and capable of handling
                            jet aircraft. It would not be possible for the Air Force to do this on a
                            shoe string.</p>
                        <p>In reply to a further question, Admiral Radford made it clear that when
                            he was talking about these bases elsewhere he was not talking about one
                            located in Southeast Asia.</p>

                            <item>Sarasin reported Thai Prime Minister extremely upset that Thai not
                                invited participate five power military talks in Washington. Under
                                Secretary explained five power talks continuation of talks over
                                period several years and did not represent discussion by members of
                                collective security organ. Purpose of talks, in addition to impetus
                                for collective action, was to obtain best possible military
                                evaluation of Indochina situation. Other interested countries would
                                be kept informed and at appropriate time it was hoped, have
                                conference to include them. At this stage it would be impossible to
                                get United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, if participation
                                other countries included. Would be helpful if Sarasin could explain

                        <p>Mr. Murphy explained to the Joint Chiefs that Ambassador Donovan was
                            pleased to be present at the invitation of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                                >JCS</gloss> to discuss additional aid to Thailand.</p>
                        <p>After the usual amenities, Ambassador Donovan reviewed the plan developed
                            by himself and General Gillmore, Chief of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1"
                                >MAAG</gloss>, Bangkok.</p>
                        <p>General Twining, on behalf of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>,
                            indicated that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> approved the
                            recommendation that the Thai armed forces be increased from 57,000 to
                            90,000; that the Saraburi-Ban Phai highway be constructed if <gloss
                                target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> can finance it; and that an air base be
                            constructed probably at Korat if a means could be found to finance
                            it.</p>
                        <p>There was further discussion concerning the stationing of an air wing in
                            Thailand at the proposed air base. General Twining indicated that the
                            Joint Chiefs were opposed to this project at this time. Discussion
                            ensued in which Ambassador Donovan pointed out that it would be
                            necessary to have the wing stationed somewhere. General Twining agreed,
                            but insisted that there were strong arguments against stationing it in
                            Thailand. He added that the Joint Chiefs had not taken this decision
                            lightly. He stressed that the proposal was political rather than
                            military and that it was militarily unjustified because you would need
                            the same amount of logistic support for one wing in Thailand as you now
                            need for two or more somewhere else.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Donovan noted that there was some question whether the Thais
                            could support additional aid. He referred to the forthcoming visit of
                            the Thai Chief of Staff.<note n="2" xml:id="d428fn2">The Thai Military

                        <p>[Here follows a list of persons (27) present. The list includes the four
                            Joint Chiefs and Deputy Under Secretary Murphy, who headed the
                            Department of State contingent. The meeting began with discussion
                            relating to Southeast Asia, Germany, and the Middle East.]</p>

                        <p>Admiral Radford then introduced the subject [of aid] to Thai forces. He
                            and Admiral Carney indicated that the Thais had made a very sketchy
                            presentation of their needs. They apparently had no plan until shortly
                            before their departure from Bangkok. Our <gloss target="#t_MAAG1"
                                >MAAG</gloss> there under General Gillmore has not completed its
                            analysis of this plan. According to Admiral Radford, a large part of
                            their request is for budgetary support. The Thais stated that 25 to 40
                            percent of their present budget is used for military expenditures and
                            that under their new plan this would be increased to 50 to 75 percent.
                            Admiral Radford said the Joint Chiefs had not committed themselves to
                            anything as yet; any increase in assistance would first have to be in
                            the training field. In view of the lack of money available to Defense as
                            well as the fact that we are not clear about our general intentions in
                            Southeast Asia, the Joint Chiefs feel no long term commitment to the
                            Thais could be made at this time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Murphy said he thought at the meeting with the Joint Chiefs which was
                            recently held and which Ambassador Donovan attended,<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d429fn2">See the memorandum, <ref target="#d428"><hi
                                        rend="italic">supra</hi></ref>.</note> the Joint Chiefs had
                            agreed to an increase in the Thai force from 57,000 to 90,000. Admiral
                            Radford replied that this was not the case. Mr. Murphy stated that the
                            Secretary was concerned that the Thais would return dissatisfied and the
                            political impact would be adverse, especially on our plans for a
                            Southeast Asian alliance. <pb n="725" xml:id="pg_725" facs="0745"
                            />Admiral Radford said the biggest thing the Thais had in mind was the
                                <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> program but that he understood
                            they had called off a meeting arranged today with <gloss
                                target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> because they were not prepared. Admiral
                                Davis<note n="3" xml:id="d429fn3">Vice Adm. Arthur C. Davis,
                                Director of the Office of Foreign Military Affairs, Department of
                                Defense.</note> said that the Joint Chiefs had not said “no” to the
                            Thais, merely that their plans had to be studied further. Mr. Murphy
                            then said he wanted to be clear about the Joint Chiefs’ position. Was it
                            correct to say the Chiefs do not want to move at the moment until there
                            had been a decision with respect to Southeast Asia generally and because
                            the money was not available. Admiral Radford said the Joint Chiefs felt
                            the first action which should be taken would be a training program for
                            present forces which could be initiated within the next two months. The
                            Joint Chiefs did not agree to an increase in ground forces since present
                            Thai forces are adequate for internal security. General Ridgway
                            expressed his agreement with Admiral Radford on this point. Admiral
                            Radford said that the Thais couldn’t raise a large enough force to have
                            a significant effect if there were external aggression. Admiral Carney
                            said it was their feeling the main danger in Thailand was internal
                            subversion and therefore the internal security problem was most
                            important. Mr. Murphy repeated his remarks about the Secretary’s concern
                            about this problem and his desire to obtain full Thai cooperation with
                            respect to a Southeast Asian treaty. This discussion closed with General
                            Ridgway’s remark that the Joint Chiefs were still studying the
                            matter.</p>

                        <p>At this point the Secretary changed the subject and inquired when the
                            Thai Commander-in-Chief of the Armies, General Srisdi, would be leaving
                            Washington, inquiring also whether General Smith had been able to get in
                            touch with the Ambassador to suggest that General Srisdi remain a few
                            days longer in order to make more specific arrangements with the
                            Department of Defense.</p>
                        <p>The Thai Ambassador said that he had received the message through Mr.
                            Drumright but had not been able to reach General Srisdi yet.
                            Nevertheless, he gave assurance that General Srisdi would remain several
                            days beyond the original schedule. He expressed great pleasure at the
                            Secretary’s statement and asked as to the nature of the arrangements
                            which might be reached.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary explained that the matter had been discussed in the
                                Cabinet;<note n="1" xml:id="d430fn1">According to the minutes of the
                                Cabinet meeting on July 9, Secretary Dulles referred, during a
                                report on the international situation, to the “pessimistic attitude
                                of the Chief of Staff of Thailand who was returning to his country
                                without securing the assistance requested. The President queried
                                whether adequate administrative machinery existed for acting on
                                these questions. Secretary Anderson explained that the Chief of
                                Staff desired approval for a program greatly expanded at the last
                                minute and that Defense was merely delaying decision, without
                                rejecting the proposal, until adequate reports could be secured from
                                the appropriate military advisory group. The President hoped that
                                the Thailand Chief of Staff could be made to understand our
                                sympathetic approach before his departure.” (Eisenhower Library,
                                Eisenhower papers, Whitman file)</note> that the President had taken
                            an active and personal interest in the matter; that Secretary Anderson’s
                            staff would be working out details over the week-end and that it was
                            expected that Secretary Anderson would be in a position on Monday to
                            deal with the details of reinforcing the Thai Armed Forces.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out that he did not mean to raise Thailand’s hopes
                            unduly as the Thai plans had achieved enlarged proportions beyond
                            expectations; that the principal point right now was to get started on
                            developing the reinforced Armed Forces of Thailand. Subsequent plans
                            would be based on practical achievements.</p>
                        <p>The Thai Ambassador expressed great appreciation for this information and
                            said that in his thinking a strong Thai Armed Force would achieve three
                            objectives: (1) be prepared to defend Thailand; (2) be a deterrent to
                            aggression; (3) be a real contributor to any collective defense
                            arrangements for Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>As the Thai Ambassador was departing the Secretary instructed his
                            secretary to inform Secretary Anderson’s office that General Srisdi
                            would remain for a few days longer and would be available for
                            conversations on Monday.<note n="2" xml:id="d430fn2">July 12.</note></p>

                        <p>For the reasons discussed with you and your staff, the United States
                            Government is not in a position at this time to make further commitments
                            with respect to the future enlargement of the Thai Armed Forces;
                            however, the increased assistance which is being made available will
                            improve the effectiveness of the existing Thai forces and will also
                            provide a firm base for possible further expansion in the future. I know
                            you will agree with me that our joint immediate goal must be the maximum
                            improvement and more effective organization of the present armed forces
                            along the lines indicated as a necessary first step in any future
                            expansion. It is only on the basis of the successful accomplishment of
                            this phase that firm recommendations can be developed for any such
                            future expansion.</p>
                        <p>Because of the brevity of your stay in Washington, it will of course be
                            necessary to work out the details for utilizing this additional military
                            assistance with you later through and based upon the recommendations of
                            General Gillmore.</p>
                        <p>You are of course aware of the several specific programs of an
                            organizational and confidential nature, concerning the initiation of
                            which members of our two staffs have agreed.</p>
                        <p>In addition to this increased military assistance and these other
                            programs, I am pleased to confirm to you that the United States
                            Government will make available $3,000,000 in order to assist the
                            Government of Thailand in initiating the construction of a highway from
                            Saraburi through Korat to Ban Phai. It is planned to make these funds
                            available in increments as the construction progresses. This highway, we
                            agree, will be of great strategic value to Thailand and will contribute
                            materially to the Thai defense capabilities against aggression. It will,
                            in addition, be of great economic benefit to your country.</p>
                        <p>The United States Government will continue its sympathetic consideration
                            of the entire program submitted by you and your staff in the light of
                            the fiscal and governmental procedures which are necessary in such
                            analyses. These studies as well as the foregoing program I have outlined
                            are a further indication of the deep interest of the United States in
                            assisting the Government of Thailand to improve its ability to
                            successfully defend itself against aggression and to maintain its
                            position as a sovereign and democratic member of the free world
                            community of nations.</p>
                        <p>I am certain that you will agree with me that your visit has resulted in
                            substantial achievements and has contributed to our understanding and
                            resolution of our joint defense problems.</p>

                                limited by other U.S. world-wide commitments which under present

                                Government could significantly improve Thailand’s financial
                                position, the likelihood of the need for budgetary support from the

                                require large additional expenditures by the Thai Government in the

                                Bangkok the Thai Government presented far reaching requests for the
                                expansion and diversification of the Thai military services which
                                would involve very substantial sums of money, the totals of which

                                        developed by General Gillmore and not by the Thai. The idea
                                        was that such additional divisions should be developed in
                                        case of emergency if Thailand were actually threatened with

                                        General Gillmore and with the Thai indicated that the Thai
                                        have a three-year program in mind; that the preliminary
                                        preparation of forces in the pattern outlined should be
                                        achieved by July 1, 1955 and that the Thai would not expect
                                        to achieve full strength, which would roughly double their
                                        Armed Forces, until the end of the three-year

                                made: “Neither an increase in the yearly revenue nor a greater
                                allotment than at present from the revenue for military purposes can
                                be foreseen”.</p>
                            <p>The Thai have made it abundantly clear that any increase in their
                                Armed Forces must be made possible by United States subsidy of the
                                additional budget required. In order to emphasize their point in
                                conversation the Thai military have argued that their financial
                                position has deteriorated so that they are actually unable to carry
                                even their present military program. It is believed, however, that
                                this is an argument to strengthen their position in requesting
                                financial assistance for the increase in the Armed Forces and that
                                the Thai Government will continue to allocate present allotments for

                                        Gillmore. The most important of these three items is the
                                        last, as it is the most expensive and far-reaching in its
                                        implications. It is understood, however, that agreement to
                                        develop the reinforced corps does not envisage the manpower
                                        build-up for the three-year Thai program which would involve
                                        a grand total for all three Services of 181,728 men, which
                                        would include Army 148,654, Navy 10,662, and Air Force
                                        22,412. In other words, the present commitment is to carry
                                        out only the first year of the three-year program, which is
                                        comparable to the recommendations of General Gillmore, the
                                        cost being about $52.3 million of which about $1.6 million
                                        would be used in the first year for expanded officer
                                        training. The Department of Defense apparently feels that
                                        the larger program of doubling the Armed Forces should await
                                        more specific instructions, perhaps through <gloss

                            my office dated 4 June 1954,<note n="1" xml:id="d434fn1">Not
                                printed.</note> in which it was stated that the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff had requested the Chief of Staff, U.S. Air Force to conduct an
                            immediate study and to make recommendations as to the airfield or
                            airfields, if any, to be developed in Thailand and the Kra
                            Peninsula.</p>
                        <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff have reviewed the study prepared by the Chief
                            of Staff, U.S. Air Force, and recommend that no further action be taken
                            at this time regarding the proposal of the U.S. Ambassador to Thailand
                            for airfield construction or rehabilitation, or for the deployment of a
                            U.S. Air Force unit to Thailand.</p>
                        <p>It is considered unsound from the military standpoint to attempt to
                            defend Southeast Asia under the concept of a static-type defense, and
                            the deployment of any U.S. Air Force unit to Thailand would be but the
                            first step leading to the commitment of U.S. forces under such a
                            concept. It is further considered that the United States should adopt a
                            concept of offensive action against the military power of the aggressor,
                            rather than the concept of reaction locally at the point of the
                            attack.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, since an airfield complex exists outside the mainland of
                            Southeast Asia adequate for the attainment of the objective <pb n="737"
                                xml:id="pg_737" facs="0757"/>outlined above, and current plans for
                            implementation of this action do not require utilization of Thailand
                            airfields, it is considered that the United States should not undertake
                            the construction of airfields in Thailand at this time.</p>

                            visiting the United States, commended the bold initiative of the United

                            and security in the Far East. In the message, requests were also made to

                                Cambodia, by whatever means it were achieved, would significantly
                                increase Communist subversive capabilities in Thailand and would
                                almost certainly weaken Thai confidence in their Western alignment.

                            <item>In the latter situation, the Thai Government would probably remain
                                aligned with the West only if it remains convinced that the US had
                                both the willingness and the ability to defend Thailand against
                                Communist aggression. If an invasion in force should occur, Thai
                                resistance would probably be short-lived, unless US forces were
                                speedily brought to bear. Furthermore, the Thai might come to
                                believe that their close alignment with the US would not deter a
                                Communist invasion of their country and might even give further
                                incentive to the Communists to invade Thailand. They might feel that
                                even if the US were clearly willing to defend Thailand, it would not
                                be able to do so without protracted and large-scale warfare on Thai
                                soil. If the Thai leaders estimated the situation in this way, they
                                would probably be disposed to reject US assistance and <pb n="743"

                            Military projects included the inclusion of the entire Thai Army under
                                <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> for the purpose of creating a

                        <p>The present training program is aimed to provide Thailand with a well
                            trained and well officered Army of about 80,000. Any further expansion
                            of the Army would depend upon the success of the training program for
                            commissioned and non-commissioned officers which is the crucial factor.
                            The higher ranking officer staff is not noted for its military quality,
                            consisting largely of men who are more interested in politics and
                            business. It is believed that the average soldier is as good as other
                            soldiers in the world and that the lower ranking officers are
                            professionally competent. The great need is for trained leadership.</p>

                            Police are Thailand’s first line of defense as they are responsible for
                            the patrol of Thailand’s borders and inland waterways. Training … has
                            produced excellent results which are noticeable in the smartness and
                            high morale and efficiency of those elements of the Police located in
                            the strategically important north and northeast border areas. In
                            connection with the National Police, training has been completed of
                            approximately 700 persons for the Volunteer Defense Corps. This is a
                            village force aimed to cope with the small roving bands of Communist
                            guerrillas or propaganda agents. They might also be used conversely as
                            information agents for the Government. Their equipment is of a very
                            light Police nature. The eventual goal for the Volunteer Defense Corps
                            is 120,000. Each of Thailand’s 40,000 villages would have three resident
                            trained members of the VDC. During General Phao’s visit in Washington a
                            sum of $3 million was allocated to expand the present VDC to number
                            about 25,000 trained persons.</p>

                            the Department of Defense. The Chief of <gloss target="#t_JUSMAG1"

                            successful as he received certain specific commitments before his
                            departure which in money amounted to about $26 million beyond previously
                            committed amounts of military assistance. General Srisdi was welcomed at
                            the Bangkok Airport as a national hero. His political star appeared to
                            be at its zenith.</p>

                            representatives. Of this sum only $3 million, referred under “2” above,
                            was for direct assistance to General Phao’s VDC. The remainder was for

                        <p>Thailand’s political situation is one which does not rest upon party
                            politics. Political leadership and domination is measured in terms of
                            strong personalities who have personal followers with power and
                            influence. The three strong men in the Thai Government are the Thai
                            Prime Minister, Phibun Songgram, General Srisdi and General Phao. A
                            number of lesser individuals such as the Chief Air Marshal, Fuen
                            Ronaprakat, provide additional support to the Prime Minister’s
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>The three principal political leaders control not only Thailand’s Army,
                            Air and Police Forces but also dominate the economy of the nation by
                            economic controls and by their own business interests. For the first
                            time in Thailand’s modern history the rewards and profits of business
                            are being drained from the alien business community (Chinese, British,
                            Americans and others) into the accounts of the Thai. The Thai are aware
                            of their inability to compete in business on an equal basis with the
                            aliens. Thai officials have tipped the balance in their favor by the use
                            of Executive Orders, legislation, graft, and legitimate business
                            organizations which have the support of Thai officialdom.</p>
                        <p>Reports emanate constantly from Thailand that Generals Phao and Srisdi
                            are in competition for the position of Prime Minister; that they do not
                            come to blows because they are equally strong; that the Prime Minister
                            is helpless in their hands as they have direct control of Army and
                            Police power; and that at some moment there will be a <hi rend="italic"
                                >coup d’état</hi> by General Srisdi or General Phao to take over the
                            reins of Government.</p>
                        <pb n="746" xml:id="pg_746" facs="0766"/>
                        <p>There are a number of considerations, however, which provide a different
                            interpretation. For one thing, General Phao and General Srisdi are joint
                            stockholders in many of their business ventures, both licit and illicit.
                            For another thing, they have both been raised to their high positions by
                            Prime Minister Phibun Songgram who took them under his wing when they
                            were Captains and Majors and made them Generals and Admirals. It is
                            significant that during General Phao’s mission to Washington in
                            November, he secured a commitment for $28.2 million in aid to the Thai
                            Government and that most of the amount with the exception of $3 million
                            for VDC would tend to strengthen the Army of General Srisdi. If the two
                            were engaged in mutually destructive competition it is difficult to
                            believe that General Phao would have worked so hard to strengthen the
                            Armed Forces of General Srisdi.</p>
                        <p>The position of helplessness attributed to the Prime Minister is not
                            novel. It is interesting to note that in 1940 the American Minister,
                            Hugh Grant, in recounting his conversations with Prime Minister Phibun
                            Songgram, stated frequently that he was a fine man who was helpless in
                            the hands of the military; that he was forced to do and say the things
                            that he did and said. Mr. Grant described him as a puppet in the hands
                            of a military junta. Fourteen years have passed and the same things are
                            being said of the same Prime Minister Phibun Songgram. It is worth
                            noting that in 22 years of Constitutional Government since 1932, Phibun
                            Songgram has had things his own way as Prime Minister for twelve years
                            and appears to be in excellent health and on good terms with the current
                            two strong men in his Government, General Phao and General Srisdi.</p>

                                been found in Department of State files.</note> to the effect that
                            in case of a national emergency the Prime Minister, Phibun Songgram
                            would take charge of the Armed Forces, General Srisdi would become Prime
                            Minister and General Phao would maintain control of his Police and
                            engage in clandestine operations and be the power behind the scenes.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that the evidence indicates that far from being political
                            enemies preparing for each other’s destruction, Generals Phao and Srisdi
                            form the backfield for Prime Minister Phibun Songgram’s power team, that
                            they maintain an excellent balance of power within the country and that
                            in event of national crisis they would work together for their own
                            salvation as well as for that of the nation. These are men who have
                            risen to high position by graft, by ruthless brutality and by
                            cooperative support of one <pb n="747" xml:id="pg_747" facs="0767"
                            />another. According to Thai custom they are blood brothers, made so by
                            special ritual.</p>
                        <p>At the present time General Srisdi controls more guns in strategic
                            locations than General Phao. The generally superior training and
                            effectiveness of the Police and the capacity for rapid action might well
                            outweigh the greater numerical strength of the Army in a coup situation.
                            The additional military assistance promised to General Srisdi during his
                            recent mission to Washington will probably provide the Army with as much
                            assistance as it can absorb and certainly as much formal defense as the
                            Thai nation requires. Any additional assistance should be aimed
                            principally to improve the quality of the national Police and to
                            coordinate the training and the relations of the Thai National Police
                            with similar forces across the border in Laos, Cambodia and Burma. Such
                            a development would enhance the security factors of these nations and
                            would tend to pull them together in their stand against Communist
                            aggression. It is not believed that such a development would be inimical
                            to relations between General Phao and General Srisdi but would, in fact,
                            be an additional factor in consolidating the position of the Thai
                            Government in its anti-Communist stand and in its acceptance by the Thai
                            people.</p>
