                    <p>The treaty of which the interpretation is referred to Your Majesty’s
                        arbitrament was ratified more than a quarter of a century ago. Of the
                        sixteen members of the British cabinet which framed and presented it for the
                        acceptance of the United States, Sir Robert Peel, Lord Aberdeen, and all the
                        rest but one, are no more. The British minister at Washington who signed it
                        is dead. Of American statesmen concerned in it, the minister at London, the
                        President and Vice-President, the Secretary of State, and every one of the
                        President’s constitutional advisers, except one, have passed away. I alone
                        remain, and after finishing the three-score years and ten that are the days
                        of our years, am selected by my country to uphold its rights.</p>
                    <p>Six times the United States had received the offer of arbitration on their
                        Northwestern boundary, and six times had refused to refer a point where the
                        importance was so great and the right so clear. But when consent was
                        obtained to bring the question before Your Majesty, my country resolved to
                        change its policy, and in the heart of Europe, before a tribunal from which
                        no judgment but a just one can *emanate, to explain the solid foundation of
                        our demand, and the principles of moderation and justice by which we have
                        been governed.<seg type="margin">[4]</seg></p>
                    <p>The case involves questions of geography, of history, and of international
                        law; and we are glad that the discussion should be held in the midst of a
                        nation whose sons have been trained in those sciences by a Carl Ritter, a
                        Ranke, and a Heffter.</p>
                    <p>The long-continued controversy has tended to estrange from each other two of
                        the greatest powers in the world, and even menaced, though remotely, a
                        conflict in arms. A want of confidence in the disposition of the British
                        government has been sinking into the mind of the States of the Union now
                        rising on the Pacific, and might grow into a popular conviction, not easy to
                        be eradicated. After having secured union and tranquillity to the people of
                        Germany, and attained a happiness never before allotted by Providence to
                        German warrior or statesman, will it not be to Your Majesty a crowning glory
                        now, in the fullness of years and in the quiet which follows the mighty
                        struggles of a most eventful life, to reconcile the two younger branches of
                        the great Germanic family?</p>
                    <p rend="center">THE POINT FOR ARBITRATION.</p>
                    <p>The point submitted for arbitration is limited with exactness. By Article I
                        of the Treaty concluded at Washington on the 15th of June, 1846, between the
                        United States and Her Britannic Majesty, it was stipulated that the line of
                        boundary between the territories of the United States and those of Her
                        Britannic Majesty, from the point on the forty-ninth parallel of north
                        latitude up to which it had already been ascertained, should be continued
                        westward along the said parallel of north latitude “to the middle of the
                        channel which separates the continent from Vancouver’s Island, and <pb n="4"
                            xml:id="pg_4" facs="0016"/> thence *southerly, through the middle of the
                        said channel and of Fuca’s Straits to the Pacific Ocean.” The British
                        Government claim that the water-line here referred to should run through a
                        passage which they have thought proper to name the straits of Rosario, and
                        which the United States, for the purpose of this reference, permit to go by
                        that name. The United States claim that the water-line runs through the
                        canal de Haro. The arbitrator is to say finally and without appeal which of
                        those claims is most in accordance with the true interpretation of the
                        treaty of June 15, 1846. That is the point submitted, and that alone;
                        nothing more and nothing less.<seg type="margin">Appendix No. 1, p.

                    <p>If the United States can but prove their claim to be most in accordance with
                        the true interpretation of the treaty, it is agreed that the award shall be
                        in their favor; how much more, then, if they prove that their interpretation
                        is the only one which the treaty admits!</p>
                    <p rend="center">HOW THIS DISCUSSION WILL BE CONDUCTED.</p>
                    <p>In conducting this discussion I shall keep in mind that the restoration of
                        friendship between the two powers which are at variance is the object of the
                        arbitration. Nothing that has been written since the ratifications of the
                        treaty were exchanged can alter its words or affect its interpretation. I
                        shall, therefore, for the present at least, decline to examine all
                        communications that may have taken place since that epoch, except so far as
                        is necessary to explain why there is an arbitration, and shall thus gain the
                        advantage of treating the subject as simply an investigation for the
                        ascertainment of truth.</p>
                    <p>Since the intention of the negotiators must rest on the knowledge in their
                        possession at the time when the treaty was made, I shall use the charts and
                        explorations which have advanced, or profess to have advanced, our knowledge
                        of the *country in question, and which are anterior to that date. Of such
                        charts I have found six, and six only; and though they are of very unequal
                        value, yet for the sate or impartiality and completeness I present
                        photographic copies or extracts of every one of them. Of charts of
                        explorations of a later date, it was my desire to make no use whatever; but
                        then, as will appear in the sequel, there would be not one map on which the
                        channel claimed by the British government could be found with the name of
                        “the straits of Rosario;” I am therefore compelled to add a later chart, on
                        which that name is placed, as required for the arbitration. This chart also
                        shows the length and breadth and depth of the respective channels.<seg

                    <p>My task is an easy one; for I have only to deduce the intentions of the
                        negotiators of the treaty from its history, and to interpret its words
                        according to the acknowledged principles of international law.</p>

                        COLONIES IN NORTH AMERICA.</p>
                    <p>A parallel of latitude extending from the Atlantic to the Pacific was a usual
                        boundary established by England for its colonies in North America. The
                        charter granted in 1620 by James I, to the company of Plymouth for New
                        England, bounded its territory by the parallels of 48° and of 40° north
                        latitude “in length and breadth throughout the mainland from sea to sea.”
                        The charter granted by Charles I to Massachusetts in 1628 had in like manner
                        for its northern and southern boundaries parallels of latitude running from
                        sea to sea. So, too, had the old patent of Connecticut; <pb n="5"
                            xml:id="pg_5" facs="0017"/>so too had the charter to Connecticut,
                        granted by Charles II, in 1662. The charter granted in 1663 by Charles II,
                        to the Lords Proprietors of Carolina, adopted as their northern boundary the
                        parallel of six and thirty degrees, and as their southern boundary the
                        parallel of “one and thirty degrees of *northern latitude, and so west in a
                        direct line as far as the South seas.” The precedent was followed by George
                        II, in the charter granted in 1732 for Georgia; and in 1761 George III
                        officially described that colony as extending by parallels “westward in
                        direct lines” to the Pacific.<seg type="margin">Appendix, p. 6, 1. 14

                    <p>In the first convention between the United States of America and Great
                        Britain, signed at Paris on the 30th of November, 1782, the northern
                        boundary line of the United States was carried by the two powers through the
                        great upper lakes to the most northwestern point of the Lake of the Woods.
                        If from that point the line was to be continued, the treaty, adopting the
                        precedent of the past century of colonization, and foreshadowing the rule of
                        the future, prescribed “a due west course.”<seg type="margin">Appendix No.

                    <p>By the treaty of April 30, 1803, between the United States of America and the
                        French Republic, the United States came into possession “forever and in full
                        sovereignty” of the colony and Territory of Louisiana.<seg type="margin"
                            >Appendix No. 5, p. 8.</seg></p>
                    <p>No sooner had the United States made this acquisition than they sent out an
                        exploring expedition, which made known to the world the Rocky Mountains and
                        the branches of the river of Oregon, the mouth of which an American
                        navigator had been the first to enter.</p>
                    <p>By the acquisition of Louisiana the Republic of America and Great Britain, as
                        sovereign over the territory of Hudson Bay, became neighbors still further
                        to the west; and the two powers took an early opportunity to consider their
                        dividing line west of the Lake of the Woods. The United States might have
                        demanded, perhaps should have demanded, under *the treaty of 1782, that the
                        line “due west” should proceed from “the most northwest point of the Lake of
                        the Woods.” That point is near the parallel of 50°; the United States
                        consented to the parallel of 49°. But with regard to the continuation of the
                        line, while Mr. Madison, the American Secretary of State, was desirous not
                        to advance claims that could be “offensive to Spain,” both parties, adopting
                        the words of the treaty of 1782, agreed as between themselves that the line
                        should proceed on that parallel “in a due west course” to the Rocky
                        Mountains. In 1807 this agreement would have been ratified; but the maritime
                        decrees of the Emperor Napoleon, dated at Berlin and at Milan, disturbed the
                        peace of the oceans, and orders in council in Great Britain, which finally
                        provoked war with the United States, interposed delay.<seg type="margin"

                        plenipotentiaries were instructed by their Government as to the northwestern
                        boundary, to consent to no claim on the part of Great Britain to territory
                        in that quarter south of the forty-ninth parallel of latitude; and they
                        implicitly adhered to their instructions.<seg type="margin">Appendix No. 50,

                        as the boundary line between the two countries as far as the Stony, or, as
                        we now more commonly call them, the Rocky Mountains. From that range of
                        mountains to the Pacific, America, partly from respect to the claims of
                        Spain, was willing to delay for ten years the continuance of the boundary

                    <p>The ocean chivalry of Spain were the first to explore the northern coast of
                        the Pacific. Hernando Cortes began the work. The straits of Fuca take their
                        name from a Greek *navigator who was in the Spanish service in 1592. Perez,
                        a Spaniard, whose explorations extended as far to the north as 54°,
                        discovered Nootka Sound in 1774. In the next year Bodega y Quadra reached
                        the fifty-eighth degree, and Heceta, on the 15th of August, 1775, returning
                        from Nootka, noticed, though he did not enter, the mouth of the river
                        Oregon. In 1789, 1790, 1791, before a British keel had entered the straits
                        of Fuca, a succession of Spanish navigators, Martinez and de Haro, Eliza,
                        Fidalgo, Quimper, and others, had explored and draughted charts of the
                        island which is now called Vancouver, and the waters which lie to the, east
                        of it. When Vancouver, on the 29th of April, 1792, passed through the
                        straits of Fuca and entered those waters, he encountered, to his
                        mortification, Spanish navigators who had already explored them and who
                        produced before him a chart of that region made by Spanish officers the year
                            before.<seg type="margin">[9]</seg><seg type="margin">Appendix No. 12,

                        was conducted in London by Albert Gallatin. Re enforced as were the United
                        States of America by the titles of both France and Spain, in addition to
                        their own claims from contiguity and discovery, they remained true to their
                        principle of moderation, and again it was resolved not to insist on the
                        territory to the north of 49° which Spain had ceded; and on the 19th of
                        June, 1826, “in the spirit of and compromise, which he hoped Great Britain
                        would recognise and reciprocate,” Mr. Clay authorized Mr. Gallatin to
                        propose “the extension of the line on the parallel of 49° from the Stony

                        inadmissible. Here is the first intimation of the boundary line of 49° to

                        Vancouver Island in an inconvenient manner, he had in view the exchange of
                        that southern extremity for an equivalent north of 49° on the mainland. Here
                        is the first intimation of the possibility, on the part of the United
                        States, to vary from the line of 49°, but only so far as to yield to Great
                        Britain the southern extremity of Vancouver Island, in return for a full
                            equivalent.<seg type="margin">Appendix No. 11, p. 13.</seg></p>
                    <p>*But the interest of the Hudson Bay Company was better subserved by leaving
                        the whole region open to the fur trade, and the United States on their part
                        had no motive for hastening an adjustment. The American envoy, therefore, in
                        1827 consented to prolong the treaty of 1818, yet with the proviso that
                        either party might abrogate it, on giving notice of twelve months tothe
                        other contracting party. Under this convention the question of jurisdiction
                        and boundary remained in abeyance for nearly sixteen years.<seg

                    <p>American emigrants had already begun to find their way on foot across the
                        continent. In 1843 a thousand emigrants, armed men, women, and children,
                        with wagons and cattle, having assembled on the western frontier of
                        Missouri, marched across the plains and through the mountain passes to the
                        fertile valley of the Willamette in Oregon. The ability of America to
                        enforce its rights by occupation grew with every year. But its increasing
                        power did not change its policy of moderation, and to meet the wish of Lord
                        Aberdeen, on the 9th of October, 1843, the Government of the United States
                        sent to Mr. Everett the necessary powers, with this instruction: “The offer
                        of the forty-ninth parallel may be again tendered, with the right of
                        navigating the Columbia on equal terms.”<seg type="margin">Appendix No. 16,

                        the Oregon question; and the concession of Lord Aberdeen appearing to invite
                        an expression of the extremest modification which the United States could
                        admit to their former proposal, Mr. Everett reports that he said:<seg

                        consequently the command of the straits of Fuca on both sides. I then
                        pointed out on a map the extent of this concession; and Lord Aberdeen said

                        that they should waive their claim to the southern extremity of Vancouver
                        Island, and that Lord Aberdeen uniformly answered: “he did not think there

                    <p>During the following months Mr. Everett and Lord Aberdeen, both wishing
                        sincerely to settle the controversy, had further frequent conversations,
                        and, as the result of them all, Mr. Everett reported that England would not
                        accept the *naked parallel of 49° to the ocean, but would consent to the
                        line of the forty-ninth degree, provided it could be so modified as to leave
                        to Great Britain the southern extremity of Vancouver Island. “I have spared
                        no pains,” wrote Mr. Everett on the 28th of February, 1845, “to impress upon
                        Lord Aberdeen’s mind the persuasion that the utmost which the United States
                        can concede is the 49th parallel with the modification suggested, taking
                        always care to add that I had no authority tor saying that even that

                    <p>To one fact I particularly invoke the attention of the Imperial arbitrator:
                        not the least room for doubt was left by Mr. Everett with regard to the
                        extent of the modification proposed. He had pointed it out to Lord Aberdeen
                        on the map, and had so often and so carefully directed his attention to it,
                        that there could be no misapprehension on the limit of the proposed
                        concession. Mr. Everett retired from office in the full persuasion that the
                        northwestern boundary would be settled, whenever the United States would
                        consent so far to depart from the parallel of 49° as to leave the whole of
                        Vancouver Island to Great Britain.</p>
                    <p rend="center">THE PAMPHLET OF MR. STURGIS.</p>
                    <p>The subject attracted public attention. On the 22d of January, 1845, Mr.
                        William Sturgis, a distinguished citizen of the United States who had passed
                        several years on the northwest coast of America, delivered in Boston a
                        lecture on what was now generally called the Oregon question, in which,
                        hitting exactly the idea of Mr. Everett, he proposed as the boundary: “a
                        continuation of the parallel of 49° across the Rocky Mountains to
                        tide-water, say to the middle of the Gulf of Georgia; thence by the
                        northernmost navigable passage (not north of 49°) to the straits of Juan de
                        Fuca, and down the middle of these straits to the Pacific Ocean; the
                        navigation of the Gulf of Georgia and the Straits of Fuca to be forever
                        *free to both parties; all the islands and other territory lying south and
                        east of this line to belong to the United States, and all north and west to

                        pronounced it “a clear and sensible view of the matter.” Lord Ashburton,

                    <p>Meantime the negotiation on the Oregon question had been transferred to the
                        new British minister at Washington. Offers of arbitration had been rejected;
                        emigration across the plains gave promise of founding States on the Pacific;
                        and the Congress of the United States teemed with propositions to prepare
                        for establishing a territorial government in Oregon. When the administration
                        of Mr. Polk entered upon office, all parties in America were unanimous in
                        insisting on a boundary at the least as favorable as the parallel of 49°;
                        while a very large number, and seemingly the largest number, thought the
                        time had come for America, as the heir of Spain, to carry its claims beyond
                        the parallel of 49°. But the new administration would not swerve from the
                        moderation which had marked the policy of the country.</p>
                    <p>Meantime both parties had received more accurate information on the geography
                        of that district. In July, 1841, Captain Wilkes had made a survey of the
                        waters south of 49°, especially of the channel of Haro; and in the early
                        part of 1845 his narrative and accompanying map had been published both in
                        America and England. Believing now that Great Britain would accept the line
                        of 49°, with the small modification for the southern end of Vancouver
                        Island, the American administration, on the 12th of July, 1845, made to the
                        British minister at Washington the proposal, “that the Oregon territory
                        shall be divided between the two countries by the forty-ninth parallel of
                        north latitude from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean; offering at
                        the same time to make free to Great Britain any port or ports on Vancouver’s
                        Island south of this parallel, which the British government may desire.” A
                        friendly spirit dictated the proposition, which it was sincerely hoped and
                        expected might “prove the foundation of lasting peace and harmony between
                        the two countries.”<seg type="margin">[15]</seg><seg type="margin">Appendix

                    <p>The proposition, which excited surprise by its moderation, was rejected by
                        the British plenipotentiary at Washington, who, without even waiting to
                        refer the subject to the ministry in England, suffered the negotiation on
                        his part to drop, expressing his trust that the United States would offer
                        “some further proposal for the settlement of the Oregon question.”<seg

                    <p>In consequence of receiving such an answer, the American Secretary of State
                        withdrew the offer that he had made.</p>
                    <p>On hearing of this abrupt rejection of the American proposal, Lord Aberdeen
                        invited Mr. MacLane, the new American minister at London, to an interview,
                        of which Mr. MacLane made report:<seg type="margin">Appendix No. 31, p.

                    <p>Lord Aberdeen not only lamented but censured the rejection of our proposition
                        by <pb n="10" xml:id="pg_10" facs="0024"/>Mr. Pakenham without referring it
                        to his government. He stated that if Mr. Pakenham had communicated the
                        American proposition to the government here, as he was expected to have
                        done, he, Lord Aberdeen, would have taken it up as a basis of his action,
                        and entertained little doubt that he would have been enabled *to propose
                        modifications which might have resulted in an adjustment mutually
                        satisfactory to both governments.<seg type="margin">[16]</seg></p>
                    <p>The conduct of Mr. Pakenham was not censored in private only. Lord Aberdeen
                        censured it in the House of Lords. In the House of Commons, on the night of
                        Friday, the 23d of January, 1846, Lord John Russell condemned it as “a hasty
                        proceeding.” Sir Robert Peel was cheered, when on the same evening he
                            observed:<seg type="margin">Appendix No. 34. p. 37–39.</seg></p>

                        he was loudly applauded by the House, as he gave a pledge for his own future

                        United States, under the late administration, could have conceded. The only
                        doubt was now, if the United States would still be willing to yield so much.
                        The rude rejection of Mr. Buchanan’s proposal had roused and united their
                        people. Mr. Calhoun, the late Secretary of State, and the ablest Senator
                        from one section of the country, declared himself in the Senate for the
                        forty-ninth degree as the boundary line. Mr. Webster, the former Secretary
                        of State, who had settled with Lord Ashburton the northeastern boundary,
                        repeatedly “said as plainly as he could speak, or put down *words in
                        writing, that England must not expect anything south of forty-nine degrees.”
                        All those members of Congress who were of a different mind, Mr. John Quincy
                        Adams, a late President of the United States, Mr. Cass, afterward Secretary
                        of State, Mr. Sevier, then the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs,
                        contended, not for less than the line of forty-nine degrees, but, under the
                        heirship from Spain, for very much more. The voice of England became loud
                        for the line of the forty-ninth parallel. Mr. Bates, an American naturalized
                        in Great Britain by act of Parliament, and much trusted by both governments,
                        wrote from London:<seg type="margin">Appendix No. 35, p. 39–41.</seg><seg

                    <p>The forty-ninth degree, to the strait, giving Vancouver’s Island to Great
                        Britain, is as much as any American, be he Bostonian or Carolinian, will, I
                        think, consent to give up. If Great Britain is not satisfied with that, let
                        them have war if they want it.</p>
                    <p>The British government sought anxiously to know what proposition the American
                        Government would consent to receive, and the American Government proved its
                        firmness by its moderation. To protect the rights of the country, Congress
                        voted to give to Great Britain the twelve months’ notice required by treaty,
                        for terminating the convention of 1827, and thus open the region of the
                        Northwest to the progress of American colonization. Meanwhile, on the 26th
                        of February, 1846, Mr. Buchanan answered, that the President would consent
                        to consult the Senate on the proposition, to divide <pb n="11"
                            xml:id="pg_11" facs="0025"/>the territory between the two countries “by
                        the forty-ninth parallel and the straits of Fuca,” so that “the cape of
                        Vancouver’s Island would be surrendered to Great Britain.” This was exactly
                        the proposition of Mr. Everett.<seg type="margin">P. 35, 1. 11,

                    <p>On the 15th of May, 1846, information of the notice for terminating the
                        convention of 1827 was received by the British ministry in London. For four
                        years Lord Aberdeen had been striving to close this question of boundary. He
                        had privately and publicly censured his subordinate, Mr. Pakenham, at
                        Washington, for rejecting the parallel of forty-nine. *He had taken pains to
                        learn what deviation from that parallel the United States might accept. The
                        Secretary of State for the United States, after minute inquiry concerning
                        the probable vote of the Senate, had promised not at once to reject the
                        offer of the line proposed by Mr. Everett, and not to listen to any demand
                        for a larger concession. This had been formally communicated to the British
                        Government by Mr. MacLane, the American minister at London. And now, within
                        two days alter receiving news of the termination of the convention of 1827,
                        Lord Aberdeen held a lengthened conference with Mr. MacLane, in which the
                        nature of the proposition he contemplated submitting for an amicable
                        settlement of the Oregon question “formed the subject of a full and free
                        conversation.” Mr. MacLane was a calm and experienced statesman, trained in
                        business, exact in his use of words, careful especially in reporting what
                        was said by others. Lord Aberdeen in the House of Lords publicly expressed
                        his esteem for him, founded on an acquaintance which dated from fifteen or
                        six teen years before.<seg type="margin">Appendix No. 42, p. 46, 1. 15–18,

                    <p>With this knowledge of Mr. MacLane’s character, and of the confidence reposed
                        in him by Lord Aberdeen, I request the imperial arbitrator to take in hand
                        the map of the Oregon territory by Wilkes, which had been published in
                        England as well as in America in 1845, and which was the latest, most
                        authentic, and best map of the Territory, as well as the only one recognized
                        by the American Senate; and with this map in hand to read the following
                        extract from Mr. MacLane’s official report of the interview, made on the

                    <p>I have now to state that instructions will be transmitted to Mr. Pakenham by
                        the steamer of to-morrow to submit a new and further proposition on the part
                        of this Government for a partition of the territory in dispute.<seg

                    <p>The proposition, most probably, will offer substantially:</p>
                    <p>First. To divide the territory by the extension of the line on the parallel
                        of forty-nine to the sea; that is to say, *to the arm of the sea called
                        Birch’s Bay, thence by the canal de Arro and straits of Fuca to the
                            ocean.<seg type="margin">[19]</seg></p>

                    <p>Here follow other clauses conceding to the Hudson Bay Company a temporary use
                        of the Oregon River for navigation, with other advantages, and protection to
                        British subjects who would suddenly come under the jurisdiction of the
                        United States. To these clauses the phrase “most probably” applies, for they
                        were not precisely ascertained; but not to the boundary; on that point the
                        further statement of Mr. MacLane in the same dispatch leaves no room for a
                        doubt. His words are:<seg type="margin">P. 47.</seg></p>
                    <p>During the preceding administration of our Government, the extension of the
                        line on the forty-ninth parallel to the straits of Fuca, as now proposed by
                        Lord Aberdeen, was actually suggested by my immediate predecessor, (Mr.
                        Everett,) as one he thought his Government might accept.<seg type="margin"
                            >P. 48, 1. 25–29.</seg></p>
                    <p>Now what the proposal of Mr. Everett had been, we know from the <pb n="12"
                            xml:id="pg_12" facs="0026"/>citations which I have made from his
                        dispatches; and I have already referred to the fact that he had drawn the
                        line of demarkation upon the map, and specially directed the attention of
                        Lord Aberdeen to it.</p>
                    <p>On the same day Lord Aberdeen sent the treaty which Mr. Pakenham was to
                        invite Mr. Buchanan to sign. In the accompanying instruction to Mr. Pakenham
                        he accepted the parallel of 49° as the radical principle of the boundary,
                        and described the line as a line of demarkation “leaving the whole of
                        Vancouver Island with its ports and harbors in the possession of Great
                            Britain.”<seg type="margin">Appendix No. 43, p. 49.</seg><seg

                    <p>A suspicion of ambiguity could not lurk in the mind of any one. Mr. Benton
                        found the language so clear that he adopted it as his own. In his speech in
                        the Senate on the clay of the ratification of the treaty, he said:</p>
                    <p>The first article of the treaty is in the very words which I myself would
                        have used, if the two governments had *left it to me to draw the boundary
                        line between them. * * * The line established by the first article follows
                        the parallel of 49° to the sea, with a slight deflection, through the
                        Straits of Fuca, to avoid cutting off the south end of Vancouver’s Island. *
                        * *When the line reaches the channel which separates Vancouver’s Island from
                        the continent, it proceeds to the middle of the channel, and thence, turning
                        south, though the channel de Haro, (wrongly written Arro on the maps,) to
                        the Straits of Fuca, and then west, through the middle of that strait, to
                        the sea. This gives us * * * the cluster of islands between de Haro’s
                        Channel and the continent.<seg type="margin">[20]</seg><seg type="margin"
                            >Appendix No. 44, p. 50.</seg></p>
                    <p>The language of the treaty seemed perfectly clear to the Senate, to the
                        President, to his Secretary of State, and to every one of his constitutional
                        advisers, as departing from the line of the parallel of 49° only so far as
                        to yield the southern extremity of Vancouver’s Island, and no more. And so
                        it was signed on the 15th of June, 1846, and returned to England for the
                        exchange of ratifications.</p>
                    <p>In the House of Commons Lord Palmerston welcomed it as honorable to both
                        countries; Sir Robert Peel quoted from a dispatch which proved that he was
                        aware of the three days’ debate in the American Senate on the treaty before
                        its approval. He cited every word of the article on the boundary, and
                        interpreted it thus:<seg type="margin">Appendix No. 5, p. 54, 1. 13,

                    <p>Those who remember the local conformation of that country will understand
                        that that which we proposed is the continuation of the forty-ninth parallel
                        of latitude till it strikes the Straits of Fuca: that that parallel should
                        not be continued as a boundary across Vancouver’s Island, thus depriving us
                        of a part of Vancouver’s Island, but that the middle of the channel shall be
                        the future boundary, thus leaving us in possession of the whole of
                        Vancouver’s Island, with equal right to the navigation of the straits.<seg

                    <p>It had been the special object of Mr. Buchanan to leave nothing in the treaty
                        which could give occasion to future controversy. And on the night before Sir

                        of kindred origin and common language, and having at length “closed every
                        cause of dissension between the two countries.” All Great Britain, all the
                        United States, were gladdened by the belief that at last every controversy
                        between the two nations had come to a happy end.<seg type="margin">Appendix

                    <p>And yet it was not so. My country has had no serious difficulties on its
                        limits with any power but Great Britain. When its boundary on the <pb n="13"
                            xml:id="pg_13" facs="0027"/>south with Spain was adjusted by treaty, not
                        a difference arose, though the line extended from sea to sea. When,
                        afterward, the southern boundary was regulated with Mexico under a treaty
                        most imperfect in its descriptions, commissioners unrestrained by
                        instructions promptly settled the line. It is with Great Britain alone that
                        obstinate dissensions on boundaries, extending from the Gulf of Saint
                        Lawrence to the Pacific, have exercised disturbing influences for sixty-four
                        years. At last we thought ourselves assured of quiet on that side also by
                        the treaty of 1846; and though its terms were not altogether satisfactory,
                        the country, in the expectation of rest, accepted cheerfully and unanimously
                        the action of its Government. Yet, after a pause of hardly two years, the
                        strife was re-opened by the ministry which succeeded that of Sir Robert
                        Peel. Under instructions from Lord Palmerston, the British minister at
                        Washington on the *13th of January, 1848, in a proposed draught of
                        instructions to commissioners for settling the boundary, indirectly
                        insinuated a claim that the line of boundary should be drawn on the channel
                        through which Vancouver in 1792 had sailed from Admiralty Inlet to Birch’s
                            Bay.<seg type="margin">[22]</seg></p>
                    <p>This insinuation took the American Government by surprise. The history of the
                        negotiation shows that no such line was suggested by either side to the
                        other. Vancouver was an explorer, who examined every inlet and bay and
                        passage, not a merchant seeking the shortest, most natural, and best
                        passage. Nothing justifies a reference to his course of sailing from one
                        interior bay to another, as the line of the treaty. The suggestion is in
                        open conflict with the law of nations. The draught of the treaty was made
                        entirely, even to the minutest word, by the British ministry, and was signed
                        by both parties without change. The British government cannot, therefore,
                        take advantage of an ambiguity of their own, otherwise the draught of the
                        treaty would have been a snare. Such is the principle of natural right, such
                        the established law of nations. Hugo Grotius lays down the rule that the
                        inter pretation must be made against the party which draughted the
                        conditions: “Ut contra eum fiat interpretatio, qui conditiones elocutus
                        est.” But no one has expressed this more clearly than Vattel, who

                    <p>Voici une règle qui coupe court à toute chicane: Si celui qui pouvoit et
                        devoit s’expliquer nettement et pleinement, ne l’a pas fait, tant pis pour
                        lui: il ne peut être reçu à apporter subséquemment des restrictions qu’il
                        n’a pas exprimées. C’est la maxime du droit romain: pactionem obscuram iis
                        nocere, in quorum fuit potestate legem apertius conscribere. L’équité de
                        cette règle saute aux yeux; sa nécessité n’est pas moins évidente. Nulle
                        convention assurée, nulle concession ferme et solide, si on peut les rendre
                        *vaines par des limitations subséquentes, qui devoient être énoncées dans
                        l’acte, si elles étoient dans la volonté des contractans.<seg type="margin"

                    <p>“Here is a rule which cuts short all chicanery: If he who could and should
                        express himself plainly and fully, has not done so, so much the worse for
                        him; he cannot be permitted subsequently to introduce restrictions which he
                        has not expressed. It is the maxim of Roman law: An obscure contract harms
                        those in whose power it was to lay down the law more clearly. The equity of
                        this rule is self-evident; its necessity is not less obvious. There can be
                        no assured convention, no firm and solid concession, if they can be rendered
                        vain by subsequent limitations, which ought to have been announced in the
                        act, if they existed in the intention of the contracting parties.”</p>

                    <p>And can it be true, that Sir Robert Peel and Lord Aberdeen were insincere in
                        their professions of an earnest desire to settle the boundary question in

                        cast up the account of his ministry for the judgment of posterity, and
                        declared, in the most public and solemn manner, that he “had closed every

                        indeed planted the seed of embittered discord in the instrument that he and
                        his associate minister claimed as their own work, and extolled as a

                    <p>My respect for Sir Robert Peel and his administration forbids the thought

                        the present treaty are so singularly clear that they may claim protection
                        under the first general maxim of international law on the subject of

                    <p rend="center">THE WORDS OF THE TREATY.</p>
                    <p>The words of the treaty are as follows:</p>
                    <p>From the point on the forty-ninth parallel of north latitude, where the
                        boundary laid down in existing treaties and conventions between the United
                        States and Great Britain terminates, the line of boundary between the
                        territories of the United States and those of Her Britannic Majesty shall be
                        continued westward along the said forty-ninth parallel of north latitude, to
                        the middle of the channel which separates the continent from Vancouver
                        Island, and thence southerly through the middle of the said channel, and of
                        Fuca’s Straits, to the Pacific Ocean: <hi rend="italic">Provided</hi>, <hi
                            rend="italic">however</hi>, That the navigation of the whole of the said
                        channel and straits south of the forty-ninth parallel of north latitude
                        remain free and open to both parties.<seg type="margin">Appendix No. 1, p.
                            3.</seg></p>
                    <p rend="center">THE WORDS OF THE TREATY, TAKEN TOGETHER.</p>
                    <p>The language of the treaty, taken as a whole, admits no interpretation but
                        the American. The radical principle of the boundary is the forty-ninth
                        parallel of north latitude, and the only reason for departing from that
                        parallel was to yield the whole of Vancouver Island, and no more, to the
                        power which would already possess the greater part of that island. To
                        express this line concisely, in both countries it was described as the line
                        of the “forty-ninth parallel and Fuca’s Straits.” This short form of
                        expression occurs many times in the dispatches *of Mr. MacLane; in the
                        instructions of Mr. Buchanan: in the letters of Mr. Bates from London; in an
                        article in the London Quarterly Review, written in February, 1846, and
                        published in March; and, finally, in the speech of Sir Robert Peel, on the
                        29th of June, 1846, which I have already quoted. The description of the line
                        as that “of the forty-ninth parallel and Fuca’s Straits” was not only the
                        usage of the day; it was also well chosen for all time. The forty-ninth
                        parallel can be found as long as the sun shall continue in the heavens;
                        Fuca’s Straits end at the southeast cape of Vancouver Island, and will end
                        there till nature shall heave with a convulsion. If the name of Haro does
                        not specially appear in the treaty, let it be borne in mind that neither
                        does the name of the Gulf of Georgia.<seg type="margin">[25]</seg></p>
                    <p rend="center">THE CHANNEL.</p>
                    <p>The words of the description, considered collectively, establish the American
                        interpretation of the treaty and exclude every other. The same result
                        follows from the consideration of each separate word. When <pb n="15"
                            xml:id="pg_15" facs="0035"/>the treaty speaks of the “channel,” for that
                        part south and west of Birch’s Bay, it must mean the channel of Haro, for no
                        other “channel” was known to the negotiators. The channel of Haro was on the
                        map of Vancouver, the highest English authority, and on the map of Wilkes,
                        the highest American authority at the time when the treaty was signed; and
                        no other channel is named on either of these maps, or on any map used by the
                        negotiators. On the chart of those waters by Duflot de Mofras, published in
                        1844, under the auspices of Louis Philippe and the French ministry, the
                        channel of Haro is named, and no other. In the collection of maps in the
                        Royal Library at Berlin, not a single German or other map, anterior to June,
                        1846, names any other channel than that of Haro. How is it possible, then,
                        that any other channel could have been intended, when no other was named on
                        any map which it can be pretended *was known to Lord Aberdeen or Mr.
                        MacLane, to Mr. Buchanan or Mr. Pakenham?<seg type="margin">Map C.</seg><seg

                    </figure>
                    <p>Again, the word “channel,” when employed in treaties, means a deep and
                        navigable channel; and where there are two navigable channels, by the rule
                        of international law, preference is to be given to the largest column of
                        water. Now, compared with any other channel through which a ship could pass
                        from the sea at the forty-ninth parallel to the Straits of Fuca, the channel
                        of Haro is the broadest and the deepest, the shortest and the best. Its
                        maximum width is six and a half English miles, and there is no other channel
                        of which the maximum width exceeds four miles. The narrowest part of the
                        channel of Haro is about two and a quarter English miles, and there is no
                        other channel of which the minimum width exceeds about one and a quarter
                        English miles. With regard to depth, the contrast is still more striking. A
                        cross-section on the parallel of 48° 45′ shows the Canal de Haro to be there
                        about a hundred and twenty fathoms deep, about twice as deep as any other;
                        on the parallel of 48° 35′ the Canal de Haro is nearly a hundred and fifty
                        fathoms deep, against thirty fathoms for any competitor; on the parallel of
                        48° 25′ the Canal de Haro has nearly a hundred and ten fathoms, while no
                        other passage has more than forty.<seg type="margin">Map H.</seg></p>
                    <p>Not only is the volume of water in the Canal de Haro vastly greater than that
                        in any other passage—a single glance at any map shows that it is the
                        shortest and most direct way between the parallel of 49° and Fuca’s Straits.
                        Duflot de Mofras describes it as notoriously the best.<seg type="margin"
                            >Appendix No. 48, p. 55, 1. 17–19.</seg></p>
                    <p>If the channel of Haro excelled all others only on one point—if it were the
                        widest though not the deepest, or the reverse, or, if being the widest and
                        deepest, it were not the shortest and best, there might be some degree of
                        color for cavil; but since the channel of Haro is the broadest and the
                        deepest, and the shortest and the best, how can any one venture to pretend
                        that any other is “the channel” of the treaty?</p>
                    <p rend="center">*“THE CHANNEL WHICH SEPARATES THE CONTINENT FROM VANCOUVER
                            ISLAND.”<seg type="margin">[27]</seg></p>
                    <p>The next words of the treaty are: “The channel which separates the continent
                        from Vancouver Island,” and this, from latitude about 48° 46′, can be no
                        other than the Canal de Haro. It is the only one which from that latitude to
                        “Fuca’s Straits” separates the continent from Vancouver Island. There are
                        other passages which divide islands from islands, but none other separates
                        the continent from Vancouver Island. <pb n="16" xml:id="pg_16" facs="0036"
                        />In the statement the continent is properly named first, because it is far
                        away in the interior of the continent that the line begins, and it is the
                        continent that the line leaves in going toward Vancouver. But when a great
                        continent like North America is spoken of as distinguished from a large
                        island lying near it, the intervening cluster of smaller islands would,
                        according to all geographical usage, be taken as included with the
                        continent, and thus the channel of Haro divides the continent from
                        Vancouver. But we will not waste words. Nobody can dispute that the Canal de
                        Haro washes the eastern shore of Vancouver Island, and separates that island
                        from the continent.</p>
                    <p rend="center">“AND THENCE SOUTHERLY.”</p>
                    <p>The next words in the treaty are: “And thence southerly.” The southerly
                        deflection from the forty-ninth parallel is made to avoid cutting Vancouver
                        Island, and must be limited to that object. The movement of the boundary
                        line is steadily west to the Pacific. The treaty knows only two points of
                        compass: “westward” and this “southerly” deviation from the due west course.
                        The southern deflection, therefore, must always be accompanied with the idea
                        of a western direction; and of two channels going in a “southerly”
                        direction, that which least interrupts the general “westward” direction of
                        the line must be chosen as the channel of the treaty.</p>
                    <p rend="center">*“THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE SAID CHANNEL AND OF FUCA’S STRAITS
                        TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN.”<seg type="margin">[28]</seg></p>
                    <p>The next words of the treaty are: “Through the middle of the said channel and
                        of Fuca’s Straits to the Pacific Ocean.” The treaty contemplates a
                        continuous channel to the Pacific; the channel of Haro and Fuca’s Straits
                        form such a continuous channel, and a glance at the map will show that no
                        other channel can pretend to do so.</p>
                    <p>So, then, the description of the treaty as a whole applies to no channel but
                        that of Haro; and every single phrase, taken separately, points also to that
                        channel, and to that channel alone.</p>
                    <p rend="center">“THE STRAITS OF ROSARIO.”</p>
                    <p>And yet the British government ask the Imperial arbitrator to find the
                        channel of the treaty in a passage for which, in January, 1848, they had no
                        name and no other description than “the wide channel to the east of numerous
                        islands, which is laid down by Vancouver,” and which now, in 1871, they call
                        by the name of “the Rosario Straits.”</p>
                    <p>My first request is that the Imperial arbitrator will ascertain where on the
                        15th of June, 1846, the day when the treaty was signed, the negotiators
                        supposed Rosario Straits to lie. On that day the name “Straits of Rosario”
                        was, on every map used by the negotiators, placed upon the waters which
                        divide the island of Texada from the continent, far north of the parallel of
                        49°. There it lies fast anchored on the map of Vancouver, published in 1798;
                        it holds the same place in the atlas of the French translation of Vancouver.
                        There, too, it is found on the French map of Duflot de Mofras, published in
                        1844; and also on the map of Wilkes, published in 1845; and there, too, on
                        the British map of Vancouver Island, published by the geographer to the
                        Queen, so late as 1848. Then, since all British and American maps, which in
                        1846 *had on them the name “Straits of Rosario,” located those straits far
                        to the <pb n="17" xml:id="pg_17" facs="0043"/>north of 49°, how can the
                        British government invite Your Majesty to say that the straits of Rosario
                        form the line of boundary established by British and American negotiators in
                        that year between the United States and the British territory?<seg

                    <p>How and why the British unmoored the name from the waters to which they
                        themselves had consigned it, and where it remained for just half a century,
                        I leave them to explain and to justify. I remark only that they cannot
                        produce a map, English, French, Spanish, or German, older than 1848, on
                        which the passage which they now call the Straits of Rosario bears that
                        name. On Spanish maps the name is applied only to the very broad channel
                        lying north of the Canal de Haro and of the forty-ninth parallel of
                            latitude.<seg type="margin">Map B.</seg><seg type="margin">Map
                        D.</seg></p>
                    <p>Further: the so-called Straits of Rosario are not straits at all. It is the
                        track of Vancouver on his way from Admiralty Inlet to the north, as his map
                        shows; but it received from him no name whatever. On British maps it never
                        bore a name till after the British government introduced a new
                        interpretation of the treaty of June, 1846.</p>
                    <p>Again—and this remark is of conclusive importance, by itself alone sufficient
                        to decide the question—the line of the treaty must run from the middle of
                        “the channel which separates the continent from Vancouver Island.” Now, the
                        so-called Straits of Rosario neither touch the continent nor Vancouver
                        Island. They divide small islands from small islands, and nothing else; they
                        have no pretension to divide Vancouver from the continent, or the continent
                        from Vancouver.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, the water-line of the treaty must be a channel which makes a
                        continuous line with Fuca’s Straits; for the words of the treaty are,
                        “through the middle of the said channel and of Fuca’s Straits.” Now, the
                        so-called Straits of Rosario lead only to a sound, which Spanish voyagers
                        called the Bay of Santa Rosa; they do not connect with Fuca’s Straits,
                        *which cease at the southeastern promontory of Vancouver Island. Reversing
                        the track of Vancouver, and following the so-called straits of Rosario
                        southerly, the mariner would enter Admiralty Inlet; he never would reach the
                        Straits of Fuca.<seg type="margin">Map A.</seg><seg type="margin"
                        >[30]</seg></p>
                    <p>Then, too, compared with the Canal de Haro, the so-called Strait of Rosario
                        is, as we have seen, a narrower passage, a shallower passage, and a
                        roundabout passage.</p>
                    <p rend="center">CONCLUSION.</p>
                    <p>But enough: the rights of America cannot be darkened except by an excess of
                        words. The intention of the parties to the treaty is made plain by its
                        history, and the boundary which we claim is clearly set forth in its words,
                        taken collectively and taken separately. I will close by citing general
                        principles of interpretation established by international law.</p>
                    <p>A party offering the draught of a treaty is bound by the interpretation which
                        it knew at the time that the other party gave to it. Lord Aberdeen cannot
                        have doubted how the treaty was understood by Mr. MacLane, by Mr. Buchanan,
                        and by the Senate of the United States. “Where the terms of promise,” writes
                        Paley, whose work was long a text-book at Oxford, “admit of more senses than
                        one, the promise is to be performed in the sense ‘in which the promiser
                        apprehended at the time that the promisee received it.’ This will not differ
                        from the actual intention of the promiser, where the promise is given
                        without collusion or reserve; but we put the rule in the above <pb n="18"
                            xml:id="pg_18" facs="0044"/>form to exclude evasion, wherever the
                        promiser attempts to make his escape through some ambiguity in the
                        expressions which he used.” <seg type="margin">Appendix No. 49, p.
                        56.</seg></p>
                    <p>Again: “Where a right admits of different degrees, it is only the smallest
                        degree which may be taken tor grauten, “Ist ein Recht verschiedener
                        Abstufungen fähig, so darf zunächst nur die geringste Stufe als zugestanden
                        angenommen *werden.” This rule of Heffter fits the present case so aptly
                        that it seems made for it. There being degrees in the departure from the
                        parallel of 49°, it must be taken that only the smallest degree was
                            conceded.<seg type="margin">Heffter’s Volkerrecht, § 95, p. 176. Ed.
                            1867.</seg><seg type="margin">[31]</seg></p>
                    <p>Finally and above all: there is a principle which not only controls the
                        interpretation of treaties, but the results of investigation in every branch
                        of human knowledge. A theory which implies confusion and contradiction is at
                        once to be rejected; of two rival theories, that which most nearly
                        reconciles all phenomena is to be preferred; the theory that reconciles all
                        appearances and all circumstances is to be received as true. The British
                        interpretation of the treaty implies that the British, who exclusively
                        draughted it, sowed the seeds of future dissensions in the very instrument
                        by which they proposed to settle every boundary question forever; that among
                        the negotiators of the treaty there were those who duped, and those who were
                        dupes. Lord Aberdeen ceases to be the “straightforward” man of Mr. MacLane’s
                        report. On the American side the statesmen appear void of spirit and of
                        common sense, and easily circumvented. The historical process by which the
                        treaty was arrived at becomes incomprehensible. The names on maps must be
                        changed; the conformation of islands and continents and the highways of the
                        great deep are made to expand and contract so as to suit the cavils of a
                        government which does not profess exactly to understand the true meaning of
                        the treaty, for every word of which it is itself responsible. Take the other
                        theory; interpret the treaty as the Americans accepted it, and there are no
                        statesmen on the British side who attempted to dupe, and no dupes on the
                        American side. The history of the negotiation becomes clear, and is
                        consistent with its result. Mr. MacLane retains the reputation for prudence
                        and clear perception and careful statement which has always been attributed
                        to him. All words that fell from the pen or lips of every one concerned in
                        framing, accepting, or approving the treaty, agree together and *bear the
                        stamp of good intention and uprightness. Everything that was uttered by Mr.
                        Everett, Mr. MacLane, and Mr. Buchanan, by Lord Aberdeen, Mr. Benton, or Sir
                        Robert Peel, is perfectly reconciled, without even the semblance of
                        contradiction. The straits and channels may rest where nature has set them,
                        and old names may be restored to their rightful places. The completion of
                        the treaty does honor to the labors of honest and able statesmen, bent on
                        establishing friendship and peace between “kindred nations.” Persons and
                        history, and reports of conversations and the words of the treaty, all chime
                        together in the most perfect harmony, inviting an award which will command
                        ready aquiescence, and leave nothing to rankle in the wound which it
                            heals.<seg type="margin">[32]</seg></p>

                            British commissioners would have agreed to) may be admitted in case that
                            proposed by you to them be not attainable. But it is much to be wished
                            and pressed, though not made an ultimatum, that the proviso to both
                            should be omitted. This <pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0050"/>is in no

                            Ocean. However reasonable such claims may be compared with those of
                            others, it is impolitic, especially at the present moment, to strengthen
                            Spanish jealousies of the United States, which it is probably an object

                        <p>As by the convention of 1818 the forty-ninth parallel of north latitude
                            has been agreed to be the line of boundary between the tertories of the
                            United States and Great Britain, east of the Stony Mountains, there
                            would seem to arise, from that stipulation, a strong consideration for
                            the extension of the line along the same parallel, west of them to the
                            Pacific Ocean. In bringing themselves to consent to this boundary the
                            Government of the United States feel that they are animated by a spirit
                            of concession and compromise <pb n="25" xml:id="pg_25" facs="0051"

                            recognize, and ought not to hesitate in reciprocating. You are then
                            authorized to propose the annulment of the third article of the
                            convention of 1818, and the extension of the line on the parallel of 49
                            from the eastern side of the Stony Mountains, where it now terminates,
                            to the Pacific Ocean, as the permanent boundary between the territories
                            of the two powers in that quarter. This is our ultimatum, and you may so
                            announce it. We can consent to no other line more favorable to Great

                        <p>“He [the President] is very desirous of an amicable settlement of all the
                            points of difference between Great Britain and the United States on just
                            principles. Such a settlement alone would be satisfactory to the people
                            of the United States or would command the concurrence of their Senate.
                            In stating in your instructions the terms on which the President was
                            willing that the several questions pending between the two governments
                            might be arranged, he yielded as much to a spirit of concession as he
                            thought he could consistently with the interests of this country. He is
                            especially not *now prepared to authorize any stipulations involving a
                            session of territory belonging to any State in the Union, or the
                            abandonment, express or implied, of the right to navigate the St.
                            Lawrence, or the surrender of any territory south of latitude forty-nine
                            on the northwest coast.” * * * * * “II. The President cannot consent
                            that the boundary between the territories of the two powers on the
                            Northwest Coast should be south of forty-nine. The British Government
                            has not been committed by a positive rejection of a line on the parallel
                            of forty-nine; but if it had been, its pride may take refuge in the
                            offer which, for the first time, you are to propose, of a right in
                            common with us to the navigation of the Columbia River. There is no
                            objection to an extension of the time to be allowed to British settlers
                            to remove from south of forty-nine to a period of fifteen years if you
                            should find that it would facilitate an arrangement.”<seg type="margin"

                        <p>The latter part of our conversation was of a more conciliatory nature.
                            Mr. Huskisson said that it would be lamentable that, in this age, two
                            such nations as the United States and Great Britain should be drawn to a
                            rupture on such a subject as the uncultivated wilds of the Northwest
                            Coast. But the honor and dignity of both countries must be respected,
                            and the mutual convenience of <pb n="26" xml:id="pg_26" facs="0052"
                            />both parties should also be consulted. He then objected to the
                            straight line which we proposed, as having no regard to such
                            convenience, and observed particularly that its cutting off the southern
                            portion of Quadra and Vancouver’s Island, (that on which Nootka Sound is
                            situated,) was quite inadmissible. I told him that, taking only
                            convenience into consideration, their proposal was far more
                            objectionable. * * *<seg type="margin">Mr. Huskisson objects to dividing

                        <p>Mr. Huskisson then asked me whether I was authorized to deviate from the
                            forty-ninth parallel of latitude as a boundary. I did not think that he
                            had any right to ask the question; but, as it was only from courtesy,
                            and to avoid, at the opening of the negotiation, expressions at all
                            savoring of harshness, that I had used the words “whilst insisting on
                            the forty-ninth degree,” instead of the word “ultimatum;” and as, in
                            fact, the United States had nothing to conceal, I answered the question:
                            To the forty-ninth parallel of latitude the United States would adhere
                            as a basis. If, on account of the geographical features of the country,
                            a deviation founded on mutual convenience was found expedient, a
                            proposal to that effect might be entertained, provided it was consistent
                            with that basis; that is to say, that any deviation in one place to the
                            south of the forty-ninth parallel should be compensated by an equivalent
                            in another place to the north of that parallel. I must observe that what
                            I had in view was the exchange of the southern extremity of Nootka’s
                            Island, (Quadra and Vancouver’s,) which the forty-ninth parallel cuts in
                            an inconvenient manner, for the whole or part of the upper branches of
                            the Columbia River north of that parallel.<seg type="margin">Mr.

                            month, in order to complete the examination of this inlet, which had, in
                            the preceding year, been partly surveyed by some Spanish officers whose

                            directing him to make known to the President the strong desire of Her
                            Majesty’s government to engage, without delay, in a negotiation for the
                            settlement of the boundary between the two countries on the Pacific
                            Ocean, and his wish that instructions should be sent to me for that
                            purpose. * * * In the conversation which ensued, he dwelt with great
                            earnestness on the danger to the good understanding between the two
                            countries so happily established by the treaty of Washington, to be
                            apprehended from leaving this question in its present unsettled state. *

                            the honor to receive your despatch No. 62, inclosing a full power from
                            the President to treat with this government for the adjustment of the
                            Oregon boundary, and containing your instructions on that subject. I
                            lost no time in applying for an interview with Lora Aberdeen, <pb n="29"
                                xml:id="pg_29" facs="0055"/>and saw him the first day of his return
                            to town. On apprising *him of the disposition of the President to open a
                            negotiation on this subject at London, Lord Aberdeen informed me that
                            such an arrangement would have been altogether agreeable to him if
                            somewhat earlier made, and reminded me that he had very often, in the
                            course of the last winter, expressed the wish that the President would
                            authorize me to treat on the subject. He had, however, lately come to a
                            conclusion and taken a step that made it necessary to treat upon the
                            subject at Washington: this was the recall of Mr. Fox and the
                            appointment of a successor. Among the grounds for adopting this measure,
                            was the belief that there would be decided advantage in putting the
                            management of this subject into new hands, and consequently that had
                            been and would be assigned as a leading reason for the contemplated
                            change. This course, he said, had not been resolved upon till they had
                            entirely given up the expectation that I should be authorized to treat
                            on this subject.<seg type="margin">The negotiation transferred to

                        <p>I had a long and, upon the whole, quite a satisfactory conversation with
                            Lord Aberdeen at his dwelling-house on the 6th instant. He was on a
                            visit to Windsor Castle, from which he wrote me a note requesting me to
                            call upon him at Argyll House (his town residence,) and I believe he
                            came to London principally for the purpose of holding this interview. He
                            returned to the castle to dinner. He told me that he had communicated to
                            Mr. Fox, by the steamer of the 4th, that his successor was appointed. *
                            * He then led the way to a free and desultory but general and
                            comprehensive conversation on the Oregon question, observing in the
                            outset that it was chiefly in the hope of putting this question in a
                            favorable train of adjustment that Mr. Fox had been recalled and Mr.
                            Pakenham appointed. * * * Lord Aberdeen assented also *to my remark that
                            the numerous stations which the Hudson’s Bay Company had estalished
                            south of the forty-ninth degree of north latitude since the year 1818,
                            though they might and unquestionably would embarrass the British
                            government in reference to that company, and through them in reference
                            to public opinion, ought not to prejudice the claims of the United
                            States. This I think a very important point, to be firmly kept in view.
                            * * * In offering the forty-ninth degree of latitude as the boundary we
                            make a very fair, equitable, and liberal offer, an offer founded on the
                            obvious and natural principles of distribution; while they, in refusing
                            this offer and insisting on the Columbia River, proceed upon no such
                            principle, but simply insist upon a boundary very favorable to
                            themselves. Our offer, I said, proceeded on the old principle of the <pb
                                n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0056"/>English charters of running
                            northern and southern boundaries from sea to sea. If it be objected by
                            Lord A. (as it was) that lines of latitude were arbitrary and might be
                            very unnatural and inconvenient boundaries, I told him that this
                            circumstance was as likely to be in their favor as ours; that lines of
                            latitude had the advantage that they could always be ascertained by men
                            of science; and that, in point of fact, the forty-ninth degree had
                            proved a very convenient line for 1,000 miles. In fact the part of the
                            boundary running on the parallel is the only part in reference to which
                            no controversy has arisen or is to be feared. Another natural and
                            obvious principle, I observed, connected with this, but not identical,
                            was the extension of contiguous territory. * * *<seg type="margin">Mr.

                        <p>This train of remark produced an obvious effect upon Lord Aberdeen, and
                            after making some inquiry as to the course which things would probably
                            take in Congress during the approaching session, in reference to this
                            subject, and expressing a strong hope that no step would be taken by
                            either House to embarrass the two governments in the negotiation, he
                            said, if this can be avoided, “I do not think we shall have much
                            difficulty;” and this remark he repeated. As not a syllable fell from me
                            authorizing the expectation that the United States would be induced to
                            run the line below the forty-ninth degree, I considered that remark,
                            twice made, coupled with the tenor of my own observation on the
                            reasonableness of that boundary, as authorizing the inference that Mr.
                            Pakenham would be instructed to assent to it. The main difficulty in the
                            way of this will be that the forty-ninth degree has twice been offered
                            by the United States, or rather thrice, and declined by England. Lord
                            *Aberdeen on former occasions has admitted as much. To meet this
                            difficulty, it may deserve the President’s consideration whether he
                            would not agree to give up the southern extremity of Quadra and
                            Vancouver’s Island (which the forty-ninth degree would leave within our
                            boundary) on condition that the entrance of the straits of Juan de Fuca
                            should at all times be left open and free to the United States, with a
                            free navigation between that island and the main land, and a free outlet
                            to the north. * *<seg type="margin">Lord Aberdeen thinks there will not

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I had a long and important conversation
                            with Lord Aberdeen on the 29th ultimo, which I now beg leave to report
                            to you confidentially for the information of the President.<seg
                                type="margin">Mr. Everett and Lord Aberdeen discuss the
                                boundary.</seg></p>
                        <p>I have observed to you in a former communication that, though the
                            negotiation relative to the Oregon boundary had, in consequence of the
                            recall of Mr. Fox and the appointment of Mr. Pakenham, been transferred
                            to Washington, I should use my best efforts to produce such an
                            impression on Lord Aberdeen’s mind, as to the prominent points of the
                            question, as might have a favorable influence in the preparation of the
                                <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31" facs="0057"/>instructions to be given to
                            Mr. Pakenham. With this end in view I had, in a former interview, as I
                            have already informed you, gone over the ground generally in support of
                            our claim, particularly urging, and as I thought with some effect, the
                            reasonableness of the terms on which the United States have uniformly
                            offered to adjust the boundary. In my interview with Lord Aberdeen on
                            the 29th I pursued the same line of argument.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>I first made some remarks on the claim of the United States, as the
                            representatives of Spain, to an extension on the northwestern coast of
                            America, originally indefinite, and limited only by the compacts with
                            Russia, to which Spain and the United States are parties. * * * * *
                                *<seg type="margin">[20]</seg></p>
                        <p>Passing from this topic I urged with all the force in my power the
                            extreme reasonableness of the proposal of the United States to run the
                            line on the forty-ninth parallel to the sea, on the grounds of extension
                            ol contiguous territory; of giving to each power the tract due west of
                            its acknowledged territory; and on the ground that in a final
                            appropriation of a region at present unappropriated (assuming for the
                            sake of argument that Oregon territory is in that condition) that the
                            United States certainly were entitled, besides their own share, to two
                            other shares, in the right of France and Spain, whose title they had
                            combined with their own. * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>After considerable discussion of these points, Lord Aberdeen finally said
                            that these were grounds which, in the main result, had been long ago
                            taken by the United States, and rejected by England; that the question
                            was quite different from what it would have been if now presented for
                            the first time; and that it was impossible for the present ministry to
                            accept what had been rejected in 1824 and 1826; that they did not
                            suppose that we, any more than themselves, could now agree to terms
                            which we had declined then; and that, consequently, there must be
                            concession on both sides; that they were willing to act on this
                            principle, and that we must do the same.</p>
                        <p>I regarded this observation, now made to me for the first time, although
                            the Oregon boundary since my residence in England has been the subject
                            of very frequent conversation between Lord Aberdeen and myself, as very
                            important. I told Lord Aberdeen that I thought it would be very
                            difficult for the United States to make any modification of their former
                            proposal, except in one point, which I did certainly regard as very
                            important to England, if she entertained any views to the future
                            settlement of the country. I thought the President might be induced so
                            far to depart from the forty-ninth parallel as to leave the whole of
                            Quadra and Vancouver’s Island to England, whereas that line of latitude
                            would give us the southern extremity of that island, and consequently,
                            the command of the straits of Fuca on both sides. If the country is to
                            be occupied by a dense population, as there is no reason to doubt would
                            one day be the case, this would he a valuable concession to England,
                            without implying a great sacrifice on our part. I observed, I was not
                            authorized to say this would be agreed to; I could only *say I thought
                            and wished it might be. I then pointed out on a map the extent of this
                            concession, and Lord Aberdeen said he would take it into
                                consideration.<seg type="margin">[21]</seg><seg type="margin">Mr.
                                Everett points out on a map the deflection from 49° that would leave

                        <p>He then asked me if I was confident of the accuracy of the statement
                            which I had made relative to the offer in 1826, on the part of Great
                            Britain, to give us a port within the straits of Fuca, with an adjacent
                            territory. * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>I accordingly considered his inquiry to proceed from some anxiety lest
                                <pb n="32" xml:id="pg_32" facs="0058"/>I should be mistaken, and a
                            wish to have the fact established that they had then offered us a
                            territory north of Columbia, in order now to facilitate the way for an
                            abandonment of the Columbia as the boundary.</p>
                        <p>I may be in an error in this view of the subject; but it is the result of
                            the closest consideration I have been able to give it, that the present
                            government, though of course determined not to make any discreditable
                            sacrifice of what they consider their rights, are really willing to
                            agree to reasonable terms of settlement. * * * *</p>
                        <p>I spoke with considerable earnestness in reprobation of the conduct of
                            the Hudson’s Bay Company in multiplying and pushing their posts far to
                            the south of the Columbia, and said I trusted that the government would
                            not allow itself to be embarrassed by this circumstance. Fair warning
                            had been given to the company in 1818, that no settlements after that
                            date should prejudice the rights of either party. He said he did not
                            consider the existence of those settlements as a very serious matter,
                            but the navigation of the Columbia was a serious one. * * *</p>

                            <p>It appears from Mr. Gallatin’s correspondence that at a former
                                conference Mr. Huskisson had especially objected to the extension of
                                the forty-ninth degree to the Pacific, on the ground that it would
                                cut off the southern extremity of Quadra and Vancouver’s Island.</p>
                            <p>My suggestion yesterday would obviate this objection. I ought,
                                however, to repeat, in thus alluding to that suggestion in writing,
                                that though it would have been within my competence to propose it,
                                (subject to the approbation of my Government,) had the negotiation
                                remained in my hands, it would have been so only under the general
                                authority to propose and receive terms of compromise. The suggestion
                                itself is not specifically alluded to in my instructions.</p>
                            <p>A glance at the map shows its importance as a modification of the
                                forty-ninth degree, and I should be truly rejoiced if, in regarding
                                it in that light, your lordship would permit it to become the basis
                                of a final settlement of this serious difficulty.</p>

                        <p>The principle of running the forty-ninth degree of latitude to the sea
                            and leaving to each party west of the Rocky Mountains the continuation
                            of its territory east was in all other respects the most natural and
                            equitable basis of settlement.<seg type="margin">Mr. Everett and Lord
                                Aberdeen continue the discussion.</seg></p>
                        <p>I had on previous occasions pursued substantially this line of argument
                            with Lord Aberdeen, and I received from him now the same answer to it as
                            formerly, viz, that Great Britain could not now accept terms which she
                            had distinctly refused before; that he felt that we were under the same
                            necessity; that he did not expect the United States to agree to what
                            they had already rejected; and that consequently it must, he thought, be
                            assumed as the basis of negotiation that something must be yielded on
                            each side. To *this I replied, that though as a general principle of
                            negotiation under such circumstances this might be admitted, it was
                            impossible to leave out of view the substantial character of the former
                            propositions on either side; and that in proportion as he (Lord
                            Aberdeen) should, on reconsidering the subject, be inclined to think
                            that the offer formerly made by the United States to continue the
                            forty-ninth parallel to the sea was an equitable offer, and one founded
                            on natural and reasonable principles of adjustment, he ought to be
                            satisfied with but a moderate departure from that proposal; particularly
                            if such a modification, without involving a great sacrifice to us, were
                            eminently advantageous to them. In fact such a modification was the only
                            one which the United States could, in my opinion, be brought to agree
                            to. The modification which I had formerly suggested, viz, that the
                            United States would waive their claim to the southern extremity of
                            Quadra and Vancouver’s Island, which would be cut off by the forty-ninth
                            degree of latitude, was precisely of this kind.<seg type="margin"
                                >[23]</seg></p>
                        <p>It could be of no great importance to us to hold the southern extremity
                            of an island of which the main portion belonged to England‘ while the
                            entire possession of the island, and consequently the free entrance of
                            the Straits of Fuca, would be a very important object to Great Britain.
                            I repeated what I had often observed before, that I had no authority to
                            say that this modification would be agreed to by the United States, but
                            that I thought it might.</p>
                        <p>Lord Aberdeen did not commit himself on the point, whether or not this
                            proposal, if made by the Government of the United States, would be
                            accepted. He however stated (as I understood him) that he had caused a
                            map to be colored as I suggested; that he was desirous to go as far as
                            possible for the sake of settling the controversy; that Mr. Pakenham’s
                            original instructions were drawn up in this spirit; and that since he
                            left home, he (Lord Aberdeen) had enlarged his discretionary powers. I
                            confess from these facts, viz, that Lord Aberdeen does not expect us to
                            agree to the Columbia as the boundary, not even with the addition of
                            Port Discovery and an adjacent tract of country within the Straits of
                            Fuca (which we refused in 1826,) that he has never negatived the idea of
                            the forty-ninth degree with the suggested modification; that he has
                            uniformly said that he did not think there would be great difficulty in
                            settling the question, and this although I* have as uniformly assured
                            him that, in my opinion, the United States <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34"
                                facs="0060"/>would not stop short of the 49th degree except in the
                            point above stated; I draw the inference that this proposal would in the
                            last resort be accepted. I am satisfied that the ministry sincerely wish
                            to settle the controversy, and are willing to go as far as their views
                            0f consistency and the national honor will permit to effect that object.

                        <p>* * * I deem it very desirable that the question of boundary should be
                            speedily adjusted, and that the limits and the rights of each party be
                            so clearly established and defined as to prevent all danger of collision
                                hereafter.<seg type="margin">Views of Mr. Sturgis.</seg></p>
                        <p>In this opinion I doubt not that the distinguished statesmen, Messrs.
                            Pakenham and Calhoun, who now have charge of the negotiation, will
                            cordially concur; and it seems to me that each party will attain their
                            object, and justice be done to both, by adopting as the boundary a
                            continuation of the parallel of 49° across the Rocky Mountains, to
                            tidewater, say to the middle of the Gulf of Georgia; thence by the
                            northernmost navigable passage (not north of 49°) to the Straits of Juan
                            de Fuca, and down the middle of those straits to the Pacific Ocean; the
                            navigation of the Gulf of Georgia and the Straits of Juan de Fuca to be
                            forever free to both parties—all the islands and other territory lying
                            south and east of this line to belong to the United States, and all
                            north and west to Great Britain. By this arrangement we should yield to
                            Great *Britain the portion of Quadra and Vancouver’s Island that lies
                            south of latitude 49°, which, in a territorial point of view, is of too
                            little importance to deserve a moments’ consideration; and both parties
                            would secure, for a considerable extent, a well-defined natural
                            boundary, about which there could hereafter be no doubt or dispute. Will
                            Great Britain accede to this? I think she will. Up to the close of the
                            last negotiation, in 1827, the free navigation of the Columbia was
                            declared to be indispensable to Great Britain, by the British
                            commissioners; but subsequent developments will probably render the
                            British less pertinacious upon this point. The “summary” presented by
                            the commissioners in 1827 shows that the Columbia was then supposed to
                            be the most convenient, in fact the only, navigable channel of
                            communication between the ocean and most of the numerous establishments
                            of the Hudson Bay Company, west of the Rocky Mountains. Within a few
                            years past, however, several rivers of considerable magnitude have been
                            explored from the interior to the seas into which they empty, north of
                            latitude 49°. These are “Frazer’s River,” which disembogues about that
                            parallel; the river called by Harmon the “Nachaottatain,” <pb n="35"
                                xml:id="pg_35" facs="0061"/>in about the latitude 53°; “Simpson’s
                            River,” a little north of latitude 55°; and “Stickene River,” in 55°
                            50′. All these would be within the British territory, or are so situated
                            that the British, by their convention with Russia, would have the right
                            of navigating them; and they would afford convenient communication with
                            most of their establishments north of 49°; and if this adjustment should
                            be made they would retain none south of that line. I should be reluctant
                            to cede to Great Britain the free navigation of the Columbia, for there
                            are serious objections to giving to any nation the unlimited right of
                            using a stream where it flows wholly through the territories of another.
                            For obvious reasons the exercise of such a right must endanger the
                            harmony and peace of the parties; and, especially at such a remote
                            point, would be a fruitful cause of jealousy, and very likely to
                            occasion collision. But Great Britain will not relinquish the right to
                            the free navigation and use of the Straits of Juan de Fuca, if she
                            retains the territory north of 49°. The use of these straits would, in
                            fact, be indispensable to her, for through them is the only convenient
                            access to a considerable portion of this territory. * * * * * *<seg

                        <p>I have anticipated in some degree another point to which Lord Aberdeen
                            has given great prominence in all our conversations, viz, the entire
                            impossibility that England should accept terms which she has already
                            refused. I do not think I can be mistaken in saying that, unless it
                            comes in the form of an award, she will never agree to the naked
                            proposition of the forty-ninth degree. I have, however, a pretty
                            confident belief that she would accept that line with the modification
                            alluded to in my dispatches above mentioned, viz, the southern extremity
                            of Quadra and Vancouver’s Island, though cut off by the forty-ninth
                            parallel, to be theirs. Lord Aberdeen has never told me they would agree
                            to this; but I am still of the opinion expressed in my former
                            dispatches, and for the reasons therein stated, that they would do so,
                            and I am confident that this is the best boundary which we can get by
                            negotiation. The concession of the southern end of the island, while of
                            little importance to us, would be a great boon to them, as giving them a
                            passage through the Straits of Fuca; and on the ground of this
                            advantage, I am of opinion that they would consider themselves justified
                            in acceding in other respects to the forty-ninth degree; but if the
                            expectation prevails that they can be led by negotiation to agree to a
                            boundary which we should regard as more favorable than this, I am
                            confident that expectation will prove delusive. At the same time I have
                            spared no pains to impress upon Lord Aberdeen’s mind the persuasion that
                            the utmost which the United States can concede is the forty-ninth
                            parallel with the modification suggested, taking care always to add that
                            I had no authority for saying that even that modification would be
                            agreed to. * * *<seg type="margin">Mr. Everett thinks that the line of

                        <p>I took an opportunity a few days since to explain to the Comte de St.
                            Aulaire, the French embassador, at his request, the merits of the claim
                            of the United States, and the present state of the controversy. I have
                            since done the same thing in conversation with the Chevalier Bunsen, the
                            Prussian minister, who, at my recommendation, has made himself
                            acquainted with Mr. Greenhow’s work.</p>
                        <p>A day or two since I had a good deal of conversation with Lord Ashburton
                            on the general question. Knowing that he is habitually consulted by the
                            Government on American subjects, I thought it of some importance to
                            endeavor to impress his mind with the reasonableness of the American
                            pretensions. Having done this, I stated to him my confident opinion that
                            the Government of the United States would never accept a boundary
                            materially less favorable than the forty-ninth degree of latitude. He
                            said he did not think there would be much difficulty in coming to an
                            adjustment, unless steps were taken on our side which wore the
                            appearance of defiance and menace. Any such step would put it out of the
                            power of England, as a similar step on her part would put it out of the
                            power of the United States, to compromise on any terms. I attach the
                            greater importance to these remarks, because Lord Ashburton has lately
                            conferred with Lord Aberdeen on the subject. * * * * *<seg type="margin"

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your lecture on the Oregon question
                            reached me last week, and as the subject itself interests me, and still
                            more so everything connected with the maintenance of peace and friendly
                            intercourse between our countries, I lost no time in reading it. I beg
                            you will accept my very best thanks for your obliging attention. Your
                            treatise enables me every day to answer satisfactorily the question put
                            to me so often, where is the Oregon and what is this dispute about? You
                            have stated the case distinctly in a few pages, and what is indeed
                            uncommon, you have stated it with great impartiality. Your leaning is
                            perhaps to the side of the American argument; but if those who have to
                            settle the subject by negotiation treat it with the same fairness and
                            candor you have done, there can be no danger of its leading to
                            consequences which all honest men would deprecate. I have personally a
                            high opinion of the future destinies of that portion of the coast of the
                            Pacific. The Northern Pacific Ocean, and in the course of time probably
                            the eastern shores of Asia, will find their masters in the country north
                            of California. But I have a very low opinion of any interest either your
                            country or mine are likely to have in any division of the territory.
                            From the moment it becomes of any real importance, it will not be, and
                            should not be, governed from either Washington or from West-minster. You
                            do not, or should not want land, and we certainly do not want colonies,
                            and least of all such as would be unmanageable from their distance, and
                            only serve to embroil us with our *neighbors. I am not without a wish
                            that this new Pacific republic should be founded by our own race, which
                            with an their detects, are likely to spread the best description of
                            Christian civilization; but to say the truth, I care little whether this
                            be done from Old England directly, or intermediately through New
                            England. What I do care about is that we should not quarrel about this
                            or any other measure, and I really believe that we should all be better
                            by leaving this question to sleep again for another half century.<seg

                            thank you for the pamphlets you were so kind as to send me on the Oregon
                            question. Since the date of my letter the few copies of your address
                            sent over have circulated pretty rapidly, and have been read by all the
                            ministers, I have no doubt. I now inclose you an article cut from the
                            Examiner of last week. It was written by my friend Senior, the political
                            economist, as you will see, with your paper before <pb n="38"
                                xml:id="pg_38" facs="0064"/>him. He showed it to me before it was
                            printed, as he frequently does his articles for reviews, (I suppose for
                            the purpose of getting a commonsense opinion,) and I advised him to send
                            it to Lord Aberdeen, with a note to say, if he found anything amiss in
                            it that it should not be published. Lord Aberdeen answered that it was
                            all right, except an unimportant omission in regard to the negotiations
                            of 1818–’19. A few days since Lord Aberdeen, among others, dined with
                            Mr. Van der Weyer. After dinner Lord Aberdeen came to me, and talking on
                            various matters, got to America and the Oregon *question. I carefully
                            avoided leading the conversation, but he seemed desirous to talk Oregon.
                            The sum of what he said was this: he complimented your paper as a clear
                            and sensible view of the matter; that the declaration [of] the President
                            required to be met by a declaration of some sort from this government;
                            that what had been said he hoped would be taken in the sense it was
                            given as meaning simply that the British government do not admit that

                            concession; and the terms which we suggest for that mutual concession
                            are those which, if we were arbitrators, we should award, namely, that
                            the boundary should be the forty-ninth parallel until it meets the
                            Pacific, and then the sea. Our only real claim rests on contiguity, and
                            this would give us more than mere contiguity entitles us to. This would
                            give us the whole of Vancouver’s Island, and it would give us an
                            abundance of good harbors. It would also give us the country which is
                            best for the purposes for which we use it, the fur trade. * * Whatever
                            be Lord Aberdeen’s policy, the Opposition will, we trust, not add to its
                            difficulties. * * * We trust that the English negotiators will not deny

                        <p>* * Such a proposition as that which has been made never would have been
                            authorized by the President had this been a new question.<seg
                                type="margin">Mr. Buchanan withdraws his offer.</seg></p>
                        <p>Upon his accession to office he found the present negotiation pending. It
                            had been instituted in the spirit and upon the principle of compromise.
                            Its object, as avowed by the negotiators, was not to demand the whole
                            territory in dispute for either country; but, in the language of the
                            first protocol, “to treat of the respective claims of the two countries
                            to the Oregon territory, with a view to *establish a permanent boundary
                            between them westward of the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean.”<seg
                                type="margin">[33]</seg></p>
                        <p>Placed in this position, and considering that Presidents Monroe and Adams
                            had, on former occasions, offered to divide the territory in dispute by
                            the forty-ninth parallel of latitude, he felt it his duty not at once
                            abruptly to arrest the negotiation, but so far to yield his own opinion
                            as once more to make a similar offer.</p>
                        <p>Not only respect for the conduct of his predecessors, but a sincere and
                            anxious desire to promote peace and harmony between the two countries,
                            influenced him to pursue this course. The Oregon question presents the
                            only intervening cloud which intercepts the prospect of a long career of
                            mutual friendship and beneficial commerce between the two nations, and
                            this cloud he desired to remove.</p>
                        <p>These are the reasons which actuated the President to offer a proposition
                            so liberal to Great Britain.</p>
                        <p>And how has this proposition been received by the British
                            plenipotentiary? It has been rejected without even a reference to his
                            own government. Nay, more; the British plenipotentiary, to use his own
                            language, “trusts that the American plenipotentiary will be prepared to
                            offer some further proposal for the settlement of the Oregon question,
                            more consistent with fairness and equity, and with the reasonable
                            expectations of the British government.”</p>
                        <p>Under such circumstances, the undersigned is instructed by the President
                            to say that he owes it to his own country, and a just appreciation of
                            her title to the Oregon territory, to withdraw the proposition to the
                            British government which had been made under his direction; and it is
                            hereby accordingly withdrawn.</p>
                        <p>In taking this necessary step, the President still cherishes the hope
                            that this long pending controversy may yet be finally adjusted in such a
                            manner as not to disturb the peace or interrupt the harmony now so
                            happily subsisting between the two nations.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I received, on the 29th ultimo, your
                            dispatch No. 9, dated the 13th September, transmitting a copy of your
                            last note (30th August, 1845) to Mr. Pakenham, relative to the Oregon
                                question.<seg type="margin">Lord Aberdeen censures the rejection of
                                the American proposition by Mr. Pakenham.</seg></p>
                        <p>On the day following I was invited by Lord Aberdeen, in the note hereto
                            appended, to an interview at his house in Argyll street, which I granted
                            accordingly. The object of the interview, as I had anticipated, related
                            exclusively to the posture in which the negotiations between the two
                            governments had been placed by your note of the 30th August to Mr.
                            Pakenham, and the withdrawal of the proposition which the President had
                            previously directed.</p>
                        <p>Lord Aberdeen not only lamented but censured the rejection of our
                            proposition by Mr. Pakenham, without referring it to his government.</p>
                        <p>* * He stated that if Mr. Pakenham had communicated the American
                            proposition to the government here, as he was expected to have done, he,
                            Lord Aberdeen, would have taken it up as the basis of his action, and
                            entertained little doubt that he would have been enabled to propose
                            modifications which might ultimately have resulted in an adjustment
                            mutually satisfactory to both governments. * * *</p>
                        <p>I did not fail, however, to take the occasion to press upon Lord Aberdeen
                            the great difficulties with which, in the present state of public
                            sentiment in the United States, the President could concede even that
                            which he had done in the position he had authorized. * * *</p>
                        <p>It was quite obvious to me that Lord Aberdeen had become convinced in his
                            own mind, though in what way I do not pretend to conjecture, that the
                            terms which it was his intention ultimately to propose or assent to
                            would be accepted by the President, and that on this account he
                            particularly regretted the interruption in the negotiation without
                            affording an opportunity for that purpose.</p>

                            be in a great degree informal, the Earl of Aberdeen occasionally makes

                        <p>At his request, I have recently had an interview with him, when he put in
                            my hand, to read, two dispatches from Mr. Pakennam, one in explanation
                            of his rejection without reference to his government of the President’s
                            proposition; the other containing a statement of his subsequent attempts
                            to induce you to allow the President’s proposition <pb n="42"
                                xml:id="pg_42" facs="0068"/>to stand as the basis of further
                            negotiation, or to have some assurance of the answer which a new
                            proposition from the British government would receive. * * * The
                            principal object of Lord Aberdeen in seeking the interview, appeared to
                            me to be to point out the embarrassment in which he thought the
                            President’s withdrawal of his proposition had placed this government. It
                            was quite evident, indeed he expressly said, that he was not prepared to
                            accept the President’s proposition, but desired only to make it the
                            basis of further negotiation and modified propositions from this
                            government, which he would have done, notwithstanding the rejection of
                            it by Mr. Pakenham, if it had not been withdrawn by direction of the
                            President.</p>
                        <p>* * * Although I am quite sure that the Earl of Aberdeen has no idea at
                            present of accepting the compromise contained in the President’s
                            proposition, it would not surprise me if an arrangement upon that basis
                            should prove acceptable to large and important classes in this country,
                            indeed complained of principally by the Hudson’s Bay Company, and those
                            in its interest.</p>
                        <p>That the ministry would find it difficult and hazardous to prefer war to
                            such a settlement may well be imagined, although you may assume it to be
                            certain that when war becomes inevitable it will receive the undivided
                            support of the British people.</p>
                        <p>I believe the government and people here are quite prepared for the
                            re-assertion in the message of the President’s opinions expressed in his
                            inaugural address, and, perhaps, for a recommendation *by him to
                            terminate the joint occupation in the manner provided by the existing
                                treaty.<seg type="margin">[36]</seg></p>
                        <p>And I also think that unless the recommendation in the message should be
                            such as to discourage further negotiation, and to manifest a
                            determination to insist upon our whole right, they would not lead to any
                            immediate measures upon the part of this government, or materially add
                            to the embarrassment in which the relations between the two countries
                            appear to be at present involved. * * * * *</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Our relations with the United States</hi>.—When I last
                            wrote to you on this subject, I gave you to understand that the
                            negotiations were going well, but I soon after learned that there had
                            been a hitch at Washington, and a very awkward one it is, for the
                            British government must now make the first move, and whether they will
                            make that move remains to be seen. One thing is consolatory, viz, that
                            after the publication of Mr. Webster’s speech here yesterday consols
                            improved. The stock-jobbers say that “the 49° is about right, and there
                            can be no difficulty.” That will be the <pb n="43" xml:id="pg_43"
                                facs="0069"/>feelings of nine-tenths of the people of Great Britain;
                            but this has been refused by so many ministers previously, that Lord
                            Aberdeen may hesitate; the western members of Congress will rail, and
                            the merchants will be kept in hot water another year. The Hudson Bay
                            Company prevent a settlement, I have no doubt—they might have twenty
                            years’ occupation and the right of pre-emption to their lands under
                            cultivation, and to become Americans or not at the expiration of the
                            time, as they may choose, always conforming to any laws the United
                            States may establish for the government of the territory. This, with the
                            49° to the strait, giving Vancouver’s Island to Great Britain, is *as
                            much as any American, be he Bostonian or Carolinian, will, I think,
                            consent to give up. If Great Britain is not satisfied with that, let
                            them have war if they want it. * * * * *<seg type="margin">Hudson Bay

                        <p>It will be perceived from the remarks of Lord John Russell, and Sir
                            Robert Peel more particularly, that the observations I have heretofore
                            made of the effect upon public opinion in this country of the
                            President’s proposition for compromise are fully confirmed, and that the
                            rejection of the proposition by Mr. Pakenham, without sending it to his
                            government, at least as the basis of negotiation, is strongly
                            disapproved by both parties. I have reason to know, also, that there is
                            an expectation with all classes here that this disapprobation should
                            have its influence in disposing our Government to give a favorable and
                            amicable reception to any future overtures which may be made for
                            resuming the negotiation. * * *<seg type="margin">Mr. Pakenham’s conduct
                                strongly disapproved in England.</seg></p>
                        <p>On the subsequent night, Friday, the 23d of January, the subject was
                            again introduced to the notice of the House of Commons by Lord John
                            Russell. He said:<seg type="margin">Lord John Russell calls Mr.
                                Pakenham’s rejection of the American offer a hasty
                            proceeding.</seg></p>
                        <p>It would appear that a proposition for a compromise had been made from
                            the President to Her Majesty’s government, and he (Lord John Russell)
                            conceived that that proposition had changed the state of the question.
                            The proposition itself might he satisfactory or not satisfactory; but,
                            having been made, it did appear to him to require a statement from those
                            in authority in this country of the terms on which they would be
                            satisfied to settle this question. That proposition, he understood, had
                            not been received by Her Majesty’s government, but had been declared to
                            be wholly inadmissible by our minister in America. He (Lord John
                            Russell) confessed he thought that was a hasty proceeding on the part of
                            the representative of Her Majesty in the United States, but what he
                            wished to ask was, whether the negotiations had recommenced or were
                            going on.</p>

                        <p>*Sir Robert Peel observed:<seg type="margin">[38]</seg></p>
                        <p>On the subject of the Oregon territory, I have to state that a proposal
                            was made by Mr. Buchanan, with the authority of the President of the
                            United States, to Mr. Pakenham, and that the proposal so made suggested
                            a division of the territory. Whether or not that proposal ought to have
                            been accepted, I cannot say. Mr. Pakenham thought that the terms
                            proposed were so little likely to be acceptable, that he did not feel
                                <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0070"/>himself warranted in
                            transmitting the proposal to the government at home; and, on signifying
                            this to Mr. Buchanan, the latter immediately stated that the proposal
                            was withdrawn. This is the state of the negotiation at present, so far
                            as I am informed, respecting the proposal submitted by Mr. Buchanan. I
                            have the highest opinion of Mr. Pakenham; I have the greatest respect
                            for his talents, and the greatest confidence in his judgment; yet, I
                            must say, that it would have been better had he transmitted that
                            proposal to the home government for their consideration, and if found in
                            itself unsatisfactory, it might possibly have formed the foundation for
                            a further proposal. [Hear!] * * * * * *<seg type="margin">Sir Robert

                        <p>We have no hesitation in announcing our sincere desire for the interests
                            of this country, for the interests of the United States, and tor the
                            interests of the civilized world, in continuing to strain every effort
                            which is consistent with national honor for the purpose of amicably
                            terminating those disputes. [Hear!] * * * *<seg type="margin">Sir Robert
                                Peel for a peaceable settlement of the Oregon question.</seg></p>
                        <p>I trunk it would be the greatest misfortune if a contest about the Oregon
                            between two such powers as England and the United States could not, by
                            the exercise of moderation and good sense, be brought to a perfectly
                            honorable and satisfactory conclusion. [Cheers.] * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>After these observations, I owe it more particularly to myself to state
                            that, believing from the history of our previous negotiations as to the
                            Oregon question that it may now be settled upon the basis of a
                            compromise, and, with reference to interests which have grown up during
                            the joint occupation of the territory, without a violation of any duty
                            which a public man owes to the rights and honor of his country, I would
                            not be unwilling, taking the President’s proposition of the 12th July as
                            a basis, to urge a final adjustment of the question according to that
                            proposition, but conceding to the Hudson Bay Company a continuance of
                            the privileges of joint occupation, including the navigation of the
                            Columbia, for a period of seven or ten years longer; and I hope that *I
                            may be allowed to add that I would be willing to assume the
                            responsibility of assenting to an adjustment by extending the boundary
                            to the Pacific by the forty-ninth parallel and the Strait of Fuca with
                            free ports to both nations, or by extending the free navigation of the
                            Columbia River for a longer period, provided similar advantages upon the
                            Saint Lawrence could thereby be secured to the United States.<seg

                        <p>I believe that upon one of these grounds, perhaps upon either, an

                            first indicated is entirely practicable.</p>

                        <p>* * * Sir, I am not sure but that a majority of the people, of the United
                            States would rather fight Great Britain tomorrow than yield up to her
                            any part of Oregon south of 54° 40′. I am not sure but that a majority
                            of the people of the United States are now ready to assert the title of
                            the United States to the whole of Oregon, believing, as that majority
                            do, that the title of their country to the whole of it is
                            unquestionable; and with this assertion of their title, I am not sure
                            but that this majority are not now ready, upon the slightest intimation
                            from those who have control of our public affairs, to maintain it at all
                            hazards. * * * These people, with these impressions, are now looking and
                            reading about Oregon, and are quietly and firmly forming their resolves
                            upon the subject. 54° 40′ are chalked upon doors and windows, and upon
                            walls, pillar, and post, everywhere. * * * These people are in no temper
                            for unjust concessions, in the form of compromises. Is there, sir, a man
                            in America, of any party or of any sect, that would not sooner fight
                            Great Britain to-morrow than yield up any part of Oregon south of 49°?
                            In support of our title, up to that line, and for everything south of
                            it, we should find even our Quaker friends in uniform, with arms in
                            their hands, crying aloud, in the highways and by-ways, “To your tents,
                            O Israel!”<seg type="margin">Many Americans claim 54° 40′ as the

                            degree and the Straits of Fuca—which we have hitherto called Mr.
                            Dargan’s, but of which we hear no more under that name—would have been
                            at any time and under any circumstances received with as much
                            satisfaction as now. We are more and more convinced by the advices which
                            we have lately *received, that the American cabinet will not and—if it
                            would—could not make any larger concession. It is, we believe, all that
                            any American statesman could hope to carry, and we are equally
                            satisfied, that on our part, after so much delay and complication, and
                            considering it in its future effect on the tranquillity of the district
                            itself, it is the best for our interests and sufficient for our honor. *

                        <p>The President, since the date of his message, has seen no cause to change
                            his opinion, either in regard to our title to Oregon, or to the manner
                            in which it ought to be asserted. But the Federal Constitution has made
                            the Senate, to a certain extent, <pb n="47" xml:id="pg_47" facs="0073"
                            />a co-ordinate branch of the treaty-making power. Without their advice
                            and consent no treaty can be concluded. This power could not be
                            intrusted to wiser or better hands. Besides, in their legislative
                            character, they constitute a portion of the war-making, as in their
                            executive capacity they compose a part of the treaty-making power. They
                            are the representatives of the sovereign States of this Union, and are
                            regarded as the best index of the opinion of their constituents. A
                            rejection of the British ultimatum might probably lead to war, and as a
                            branch of the legislative power, it would be incumbent upon them to
                            authorize the necessary preparations to render this war successful.
                            Under these considerations, the President, in deference to the Senate,
                            and to the true theory of the constitutional responsibilities of the
                            different branches of the Government, will forego his own opinions so
                            far as to submit to that body any proposition which may be made by the
                            British Government not, in his judgment, wholly inconsistent with the
                            right and honor of the country. Neither is the fact to be disguised
                            that, from the speeches and proceedings in the Senate, it is probable
                            that a proposition to adjust the Oregon Question on the parallel of 49°
                            would receive their favorable consideration. * * * * *The President is
                            desirous so to adjust the Oregon question as not to leave open any
                            source from which might proceed new difficulties and new dangers, again
                            to threaten the peace of the two countries. * * * *<seg type="margin"
                                >The President may consent to consult the Senate on any British
                                proposition.</seg><seg type="margin">[43]</seg><seg type="margin"
                                >The President wishes not to leave open any source of new
                                difficulties.</seg></p>
                        <p>The President would also consent, though with reluctance, to submit to
                            the Senate the second proposition suggested by you, dividing the
                            territory in dispute between the two countries, “by extending the
                            boundary to the Pacific by the forty-ninth parallel and the Straits of
                            Fuca;” but without the superadded words “with tree ports to both
                            nations.” These words are indefinite, and he cannot infer from them the
                            extent of your meaning. In case the first proposition to which you refer
                            should be made by the British government, the President would not object
                            to the terms of his offer of the 12th July last, “to make free to Great
                            Britain any port or ports on Vancouver Island south of this parallel,
                            which the British Government may desire.” If the cape of this island
                            should, however, be surrendered to Great Britain, as would be the case
                            under the second proposition, then he would consider the question in
                            regard to free ports as terminated. I need not enlarge to you upon the
                            inconvenience, not to say impossibility, under our system of government,
                            after one or more States shall have been established in Oregon, (an
                            event not far distant,) of making any of their ports free to Great
                            Britain, or any other nation. Besides, our system of drawbacks secures
                            to other nations the material advantages of free ports without their
                                inconveniences.<seg type="margin">The President would submit to the
                                Senate the line of 49° and the Straits of Fuca.</seg></p>
                        <p>There is one point which it is necessary to guard, whether the first or
                            the second proposition should be submitted by the British government.
                            The Strait of Fuca is an arm of the sea, and under the public law all
                            nations would possess the same right to navigate it, throughout its
                            whole extent, as they now have to the navigation of the British Channel.
                            Still, to prevent future difficulties, this ought to be clearly and
                            distinctly understood. * * * * * *</p>

                        <p>I sought and obtained an interview with Lord Aberdeen on the 25th
                            February. * * *<seg type="margin">Mr. McLane reports that Great Britain

                        <p>I have little or no expectation that this government will offer or assent
                            to a better partition than the extension of a line on the forty-ninth
                            parallel to the Straits of Fuca, and thence down the middle of the
                            strait to the Pacific; and if the line of the forty-ninth parallel
                            should intersect the Columbia, according to Mr. Gallatin’s proposition,
                            at a point from which it is navigable to the ocean, with the free
                            navigation of that river, at least for such a period as may be necessary
                            for the trade of the Hudson’s Bay Company, they will also, I am quite
                            sure, expect some arrangements for the protection of the present
                            agricultural settlements of British subjects south of the forty-ninth
                            degree of latitude, and north of the Columbia. If the Columbia River be
                            not navigable from the point at which it would be intersected by the
                            extension of a line along the forty-ninth parallel, I believe it quite
                            certain that the navigation of the river would not be insisted on.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * *</p>
                        <p>I must, however, repeat the opinion that, whatever may be the result of
                            any present expectation, and according to any view it may take of the
                            question, this government will not be likely to propose or assent to a
                            basis of partition different from that I have already stated in the
                            foregoing part of this dispatch. If there be a disposition on the part
                            of our Government to treat upon that basis, I have great confidence that
                            the negotiation would result in an amicable settlement of the
                            question.</p>

                            the 15th instant by the Caledonia, I had a lengthened conference with
                            Lord Aberdeen; on which occasion the resumption of the negotiation for
                            an amicable settlement of the Oregon question, and the nature of the
                            proposition he contemplated *submitting for that purpose, formed the
                            subject of a full and free conversation. I have now to state that
                            instructions will be transmitted to Mr. Pakenham by the steamer of
                            to-morrow, to submit a new and further proposition on the part of this
                            government for a partition of the territory in dispute.<seg
                                type="margin">[47]</seg></p>
                        <p>The proposition, most probably, will offer substantially—</p>
                        <p>First. To divide the territory by the extension of the line on the
                            parallel of forty-nine to the sea—that is to say, to the arm of the sea
                            called Birch’s Bay; thence by the Canal de Haro and Straits of Fuca to
                            the ocean, and confirming to the United States—what indeed they would
                            possess without any special confirmation—the right freely to use and
                            navigate the strait throughout its extent.<seg type="margin">The British
                                government will offer to divide the territory by the parallel of
                                49°, Birch’s Bay, Canal de Haro, and Fuca’s Straits.</seg></p>
                        <p>Second. To secure to the British subjects occupying lands, forts, and
                            stations anywhere in the region north of the Columbia and south of the
                            forty-ninth parallel, a perpetual title to all their lands and stations
                            of which they may be in actual occupation; liable, however, in all
                            respects, as I understand, to the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the
                            United States as citizens of the United States. Similar privileges will
                            be offered to be extended to citizens of the United States, who may have
                            settlements north of the forty-ninth parallel; though I presume it is
                            pretty well understood that there are no settlements upon which this
                            nominal mutuality could operate. I have no means of accurately
                            ascertaining the extent of the present British settlements between the
                            Columbia and the forty-ninth parallel. They are not believed by Lord
                            Aberdeen to be numerous, however, consisting, as he supposes, of a few
                            private farms and two or three forts and stations. I have already, in a

                            the Hudson’s Bay Company are prohibited from acquiring title to lands,
                            and that the occupations to be affected by this reservation have been
                            made either by the squatters of that company, or by the Puget’s Sound
                            Land Company, for the purpose of evading the prohibition of the Hudson’s

                        <p>They are, in point of fact, also, according to Captain Wilkes’s account,
                            cultivated and used chiefly by the persons employed in the service of
                            the former company, and as auxiliary to their general business of
                            hunting and trapping, rather than with a view, as it has been generally
                            supposed, of colonizing or of permanent settlement.</p>
                        <p>*Lastly. The proposition will demand for the Hudson’s Bay Company the
                            right of freely navigating the Columbia River.<seg type="margin"

                        <p>It will however, as I understand, disclaim the idea of sovereignty or of
                            the right of exercising any jurisdiction or police whatever on the part
                            of this government or of the company, and will contemplated only the
                            right of navigation the river upon the same footing and according to the
                            same regulations as may be applicable to the citizens of the United
                            States. * * * *</p>
                        <p>It is scarcely necessary for me to state that the proposition as now
                            submitted has not received my countenance.</p>
                        <p>Although it has been no easy task, under all the circumstances, to <pb

                            negotiations by any proposition from this government, and to induce it
                            to adopt the parallel of forty-nine as the basis of a boundary,
                            nevertheless I hoped it would have been in my power to give the present
                            proposition a less objectionable shape, and I most deeply lament my
                            inability to accomplish it. I have, therefore, felt it my duty to
                            discourage any expectation that it would be accepted by the President,
                            or, if submitted to that body, approved by the Senate.</p>
                        <p>I do not think there can be much doubt, however, that an impression has
                            been produced here that the Senate would accept the proposition now
                            offered, at least without material modification, and that the President
                            would not take the responsibility of rejecting it without consulting the
                            Senate. * * * * *</p>
                        <p>It must not escape observation that, during the preceding administration
                            or our Government, the extension of the line on the forty-ninth parallel
                            to the Straits of Fuca, as now proposed by Lord Aberdeen, was actually
                            suggested by my immediate predecessor, (Mr. Everett,) as one he thought
                            his Government might accept. * * * * * * *<seg type="margin">The above
                                proposed boundary-line is that suggested by Mr. Everett.</seg></p>
                        <p>I have myself always believed, if the extension of the line of boundary
                            on the forty-ninth parallel by the Straits of Fuca to the sea would be
                            acceptable to our Government, that the demand of a right freely to
                            navigate the Columbia River could be compromised upon a point of time,
                            by conceding it for such period as might be necessary for the trade of
                            the Hudson’s Bay Company, north or south of the forty-ninth parallel. *

                        <p>*I have not the least reason to suppose it would be possible to obtain
                            the extension of the forty-ninth parallel to the sea, so as to give the
                            southern cape of Vancouver Island to the United States.<seg

                        <p>The boundary (said Lord Aberdeen) having been fixed by the convention of
                            1818, between the possessions of Great Britain and the United States,
                            and the line of demarcation having been carried along the forty-ninth
                            parallel of latitude for a distance of eight hundred or one thousand
                            miles, through an unfrequented and unknown country, from the Lake of the
                            Woods to the Rocky Mountains, it appeared to the Government of the
                            United States that it was a natural and reasonable suggestion that this
                            line should be continued along the same parallel for about half this
                            distance, and through a country as little known or frequented from the
                            Rocky Mountains to the sea. And, indeed, with reference to such a
                            country, the extension of any line of boundary already fixed might
                            equally have been suggested, whether it had been carried along the
                            forty-ninth or any other parallel of latitude.<seg type="margin">Lord

                        <p>On the other hand, however, it may justly be observed that any division
                            of territory in which both parties possess equal rights ought to proceed
                            on a principle of mutual convenience rather than on the adherence to an
                            imaginary geographical line; and in this respect it must be confessed
                            that the boundary thus proposed would be manifestly defective. It would
                            exclude us from every commodious or accessible harbor on the coast; it
                            would deprive us of our long-established means of water-communication
                            with the interior for the prosecution of our trade; and it would
                            interfere with the possessions of British colonists resident in a
                            district in which it is believed that scarcely an American citizen, as a
                            settler, has ever set his foot.</p>
                        <p>*You will accordingly propose to the American Secretary of State that the
                            line of demarcation should be continued along the forty-ninth parallel,
                            from the Rocky Mountains to the sea-coast, and from thence, in a
                            southerly direction, through the center of King George’s Sound and the
                            Straits of Juan de Fuca, to the Pacific Ocean, leaving the whole of
                            Vancouver Island, with its ports and harbors, in the possession of Great
                                Britain.<seg type="margin">[50]</seg></p>

                            them. The line established by that article—the prolongation of the
                            boundary on the east side of the Rocky Mountains—follows the parallel of
                            49° to the sea, with a slight deflection through the Straits of Fuca, to
                            avoid cutting the south end of Vancouver Island. * * * * *<seg

                            of the 7th instant, the President sent a message on Wednesday last to
                            the Senate, submitting for the opinion of that body the draught of a

                            propose for the acceptance of the United States Government. After a few

                            the terms proposed by Her Majesty’s government. The President did not
                            hesitate to act on this advice; and Mr. Buchanan accordingly sent for me
                            this morning, and informed me that the conditions offered by Her

                            adopted by the United States minister in this country. That gentleman I

                            fifteen or sixteen years ago; and I am perfectly certain that, by every

                            that there is no person in this house or in this country who more
                            cordially participates in the feeling of satisfaction which it is fitted

                        <p>* * * Sir, if anything could have induced me to regret that decision on
                            the part of the House which terminates the government, it would have
                            been the wish that we should survive the day when intelligence might be
                            received from the United States as to the result of our last attempt to
                            adjust the differences with that country; differences which, unless
                            speedily terminated, must probably involve both countries in the
                            necessity of an appeal to arms. The House will probably recollect that
                            after we had offered to leave the dispute respecting the territory of
                            the Oregon to arbitration, and that offer had been rejected, the
                            President of the United States sent a message to Congress, which led to
                            discussions with regard to the termination of the convention entered
                            into several years since, which provided for a temporary adjustment of
                            our differences—at least, for a temporary avoidance of quarrel—and
                            enabled the two countries jointly to occupy the territory of the Oregon.
                            The two Houses of the American Congress advised the President to use his
                            unquestionable power, and to signify to this country the desire of the
                            United States to terminate, after the lapse of a year, the existing
                            convention. They, however, added to that advice, which might, perhaps,
                            otherwise have been considered of an unsatisfactory or hostile
                            character, the declaration that they desired the notice for the
                            termination of the convention to be given, in order that an amicable
                            adjustment of the dispute <pb n="54" xml:id="pg_54" facs="0080"/>between
                            the two countries might thereby be facilitated. It appeared to us that
                            the addition of that conciliatory declaration—the expression of the hope
                            that the termination of the convention might the more strongly impress
                            upon the two countries the necessity of amicable adjustment—removed any
                            barrier which diplomatic punctilios might have raised to a renewal by
                            this country of the attempt to settle our differences with the United
                            States. We did not hesitate, therefore, within two days after the
                            receipt of that intelligence—we did not hesitate, although the offer of
                            arbitration made by us had been rejected—to do that which, in the
                            present state of the protracted dispute, it became necessary to do,
                            namely, not to propose renewed and lengthy negotiations, but to specify
                            frankly and *without reserve, what were the terms on which we could
                            consent to a partition of the country of the Oregon. Sir, the President
                            of the United States met us in a corresponding spirit. Whatever might
                            have been the expressions heretofore used by him, however strongly he
                            might have been personally committed to the adoption of a different
                            course, he most wisely and patriotically determined at once to refer our
                            proposals to the Senate—that authority of the United States whose
                            consent is requisite for the conclusion of any negotiation of this kind;
                            and the Senate, acting also in the same pacific spirit, has, I have the
                            heartfelt satisfaction to state, at once advised acquiescence in the
                            terms we offered. From the importance of the subject, and considering
                            that this is the last day I shall have to address the House as a
                            minister of the Crown, I may, perhaps, be allowed to state what are the
                            proposals we made to the United States for the final settlement of the
                            Oregon question. In order to prevent the necessity for renewed
                            diplomatic negotiations, we prepared and sent out the form of a
                            convention, which we trusted the United States would accept. The first
                            article of that convention was to this effect, that—<seg type="margin"
                                >The words of the treaty were chosen by the British
                                ministry.</seg><seg type="margin">[53]</seg></p>
                        <p>From the point on the forty-ninth parallel of north latitude, where the
                            boundary laid down in existing treaties and conventions between Great
                            Britain and the United States terminates, the line of boundary between
                            the territories of her Britannic Majesty and those of the United States
                            shall be continued westward along the said forty-ninth parallel of north
                            latitude to the middle of the channel which separates the continent from
                            Vancouver’s Island, and thence southerly, through the middle of the said
                            channel, and of Fuca’s Straits, to the Pacific Ocean; provided, however,
                            that the navigation of the said channel and straits, south of the
                            forty-ninth parallel of north latitude, remain free and open to both
                            parties.</p>
                        <p>Those who remember the local conformation of that country will understand
                            that that which we proposed is the continuation of the forty-ninth
                            parallel of latitude till it strikes the Straits of Fuca; that that
                            parallel should not be continued as a boundary across Vancouver’s
                            Island, thus depriving us of apart of Vancouver’s Island, but that the
                            middle of the channel shall be the future boundary, thus leaving us in
                            possession of the whole of Vancouver’s Island, with equal right to the
                            navigation of the straits. * * * Sir, I will not occupy the attention of
                            the House with the mere details of this convention. I have read the
                            important articles. On this very day, *on my return from my mission to
                            Her Majesty to offer the resignation of Her Majesty’s servants, I had
                            the satisfaction of finding an official letter from Mr. Pakenham,
                            intimating in the following terms the acceptance of our proposals, and
                            giving an assurance of the immediate termination of our differences with

                                    thirty-eight votes to twelve, adopted yesterday evening a
                                    resolution advising the President to accept the terms proposed

                                    this morning, and informed me that the conditions offered by Her

                        <p>Thus, sir, the governments of two great nations, impelled, I believe, by
                            the public opinion of each country in favor of peace—by that opinion
                            which ought to guide and influence statesmen—have, by moderation, by
                            mutual compromise, averted the dreadful calamity of war between two
                            nations of kindred origin and common language, the breaking out of which
                            might have involved the civilized world in general conflict. A single
                            year, perhaps a single month, of such a war would have been more costly
                            than the value of the whole territory that was the object of dispute.
                            But this evil has been averted consistently with perfect honor on the
                            part of the American Government, and on the part of those who have at
                            length closed, I trust, every cause of dissension between the two

                            the above form, to exclude evasion in cases in which the popular meaning
                            of a phrase, and the strict grammatical signification of the words,
                            differ; or, in general, wherever the promiser attempts to make his

                            you will have it in recollection that the United States had in their
                            possession, at the commencement of the war, a post at the mouth of the
                            river Columbia, which commanded the river, which ought to be comprised
                            in the stipulation, should the possession have been wrested from us
                            during the war. On no pretext can the British government set up a claim
                            to territory south of the northern boundary of the United States. It is
                            not believed that they have any claim whatever to territory on the
                            Pacific Ocean. You will, however, be careful, should a definition of
                            boundary be attempted, not to countenance, in any manner, or in any
                            quarter, a pretension in the British government to territory south of
                            that line.<seg type="margin">American commissioners instructed in 1814

                        to the Pacific Ocean; and whereas the commissioners appointed by the two

                        runs southerly through the middle of the channel aforesaid were unable to
                        agree upon the same; and whereas the government of Her Britannic Majesty
                        claims that such boundary-line should, under the terms of the treaty above
                        recited, be run through the Rosario Straits, and the Government of the
                        United States claims that it should be run through the Canal de Haro, it is
                        agreed that the respective claims of the government of Her Britannic Majesty
                        and the Government of the United States shall be submitted to the
                        *arbitration and award of His Majesty the Emperor of Germany, who, having
                        regard for the above-mentioned article of the said treaty, shall decide
                        thereupon finally and without appeal which of those claims is most in
                        accordance with the true interpretation of the treaty of June 15, 1846.<seg

                    <p>It will be observed by His Imperial Majesty, that whereas the treaty of June,
                        1846, speaks only of the channel which separates the continent from
                        Vancouver Island, through the middle of which the boundary line is to be
                        run, the treaty of 1871 speaks of the Rosario Straits and the Canal de Haro
                        as if there was more than one channel between the continent and Vancouver
                        Island through which the boundary line may be run and be continued through
                        the middle of Fuca’s Straits to the Pacific Ocean.</p>
                    <p>It will be convenient, therefore, to bring to the attention of His Imperial
                        Majesty at once the hydrography of the entire space between the continent
                        and Vancouver Island south of the forty-ninth parallel of north latitude,
                        according to the best information which is in the possession of Her
                        Majesty’s government.</p>
                    <p rend="center">THE STRAIT OF GEORGIA.</p>
                    <p>The forty-ninth parallel of north latitude, continued westwardly, ac cording
                        to the provisions of the treaty of June 15, 1846, strikes the upper waters
                        of the ancient Gulf of Georgia, designated by the Spaniards El Canal del
                        Rosario, in Semiahmoo Bay. These waters are now termed, in British charts,
                        the Strait of Georgia. Continued across that bay, the parallel line
                        intersects a narrow peninsula, the extreme of which was named, by Vancouver,
                        Point Roberts. This point extends about one and three-quarter miles
                        (English) south of the parallel line. Continued across the Strait of
                        Georgia, the parallel line strikes at an acute angle a line drawn southerly
                        through the middle of the channel.<seg type="margin">Chart No. 4.</seg></p>
                    <p>Respecting so much of the boundary-line as extends to the middle of the
                        Strait of Georgia, there is no controversy between the high contracting
                        *parties to the treaty of June 15, 1846, that it terminates at a point on
                        the parallel of 49° north latitude in the middle of the Strait of Georgia.
                        It is with regard to the line to be *drawn southerly from the parallel of
                        49° north latitude through the middle of the channel that the commissioners
                        of the high contracting parties have been unable to agree. The true
                        direction of such a line drawn toward the Strait of Fuca would appear, from
                        a survey of the waters, to be southeast by east for a distance of about
                        nineteen miles, where the Strait of Georgia gradually expands to a width of
                        nearly forty miles, and may be said to lose the characteristic features of a
                        single strait.<seg type="margin">[4]</seg></p>
                    <p>The space now entered upon is encumbered by numerous islands, varying in size
                        and character, among which are three navigable channels leading into Fuca’s
                        Straits.</p>
                    <p>The most eastern of the three channels has been of late termed in British
                        charts the Rosario Straits, and in American charts Ringgold’s Channel. The
                        most western is termed in British charts the Haro Strait, and in American
                        charts the Canal de Arro. The latter term has been borrowed from the
                        Spaniards, who term the lower part of the strait the Canal de Lopez de
                        Haro.</p>
                    <p>There are, besides, other narrow passages; but they may scarcely be
                        considered as highways for ships passing from the Strait of Georgia into
                        Fuca’s Straits.</p>
                    <p rend="center">THE ROSARIO STRAIT.</p>
                    <p>From a point midway between Saturna Island and the continent and four miles
                        (English) south of Point Whitehorn, on the shore of the continent, the
                        waters of the Strait of Georgia merge <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0089"
                        />on almost the same line of bearing (southeast by east) into those of the
                        Rosario Strait, passing eastward of the small islands of Patos, Sucia,
                        Matia, and Clark, thence between the large islands of Lummi and Orcas. At
                        Point Lawrence, which is the eastward point of Orcas, the strait trends a
                        little westward of south for three or four miles, (English,) and then leads
                        by a due south course into the head-waters of the Straits of Fuca, the whose
                        distance from the point above mentioned as where the Strait of Georgia
                        merges in the Rosario Strait, being thirty miles, (English.)<seg
                            type="margin">Chart No. 4.</seg></p>
                    <p>The width of the Rosario Strait varies from six to one and one-third miles,
                        (English.) At its northern entrance, between the Island of Sucia and Sandy
                        Point, on the *continent, it is six miles (English) across; but the Alden
                        Bank lies almost between those two points. There is, however, a clear
                        passage of four miles (English) eastward of the bank, and a passage of one
                        and a half miles (English) westward. The least water on the shoal part is
                        two and one-fourth fathoms (English.) The bank itself is an extensive patch,
                        being two and a half miles (English) north and south, and more than one mile
                        (English) east and west. On the greater part of it, anchorage may be had in
                        from five to nine fathoms, (English.) <seg type="margin">[5]</seg></p>
                    <p>The bank is not really an impediment to the channel. The shoal part of it,
                        which would be dangerous to a ship, is of small extent, and is easily
                        avoided by good natural leading-marks during the day, and by the lead at
                        night; while it is a manifest advantage to a sailing-vessel to be able to
                        anchor in a moderate depth should calms, strong tides, or fogs render it
                        desirable, and when it would probably be impossible to fetch a harbor. The
                        width of the Rosario Strait, southward of the Alden Bank, soon decreases to
                        three and a half miles and two miles, (English,) which latter is about its
                        average breadth. Between Cypress and Blakely Islands it is as narrow as one
                        and one-third miles; but soon opens out again to two and a half miles. The
                        Bird and Belle Rocks lie almost in the center of the strait, three and a
                        half miles (English) within its southern entrance. The former is an
                        extensive rock, 15 feet above high water. The latter lies north-northeast of
                        it, more than half a mile, (English,) and is covered until near low water.
                        The tides, which sweep with considerable strength over these rocks, are
                        calculated to render the passage between them dangerous to sailing-vessels
                        in calms or fogs; but there is a good passage on either side of them; that
                        to the eastward of them being one and three-fourths miles (English) wide,
                        while the width of that to the westward is one and a half miles, (English.)
                        The Williamson and Denis Rocks, which extend about one-third of a mile off
                        the southwest side of Allan Island, are easily avoided. The former is 22
                        feet above high water; the latter awash at low spring tides.</p>
                    <p>The Davidson Rock, occasionally uncovering itself at low spring tides, lies
                        three-fourths of a mile (English) east by south of Colville Island, *and is
                        easily avoided, as it is marked by kelp. The only other hidden danger which
                        has been discovered to exist in Rosario Strait is the Panama Reef, which
                        extends one-third of a mile (English) off the northwest end of Sinclair
                        Island. This reef is marked by kelp, and uncovers itself at low water. A
                        rock, also, which is about the same distance west of Rock Islet, near the
                        north end of Cypress Island, is also marked by kelp, and uncovers itself at
                        low water.<seg type="margin">[6]</seg></p>
                    <p>The tides in Rosario Strait run with considerable strength. In the narrow
                        part between Cypress and Blakely Islands they have been found, during spring
                        tides, to exceed six miles (English) an hour; in other <pb n="64"
                            xml:id="pg_64" facs="0090"/>parts of the strait their velocity is from
                        two to five miles, (English.) The depth of water, however, being from
                        twenty-five to thirty-five fathoms over the greater part of the strait,
                        admits of vessels anchoring anywhere, if it should be necessary; but the
                        most desirable stopping-places are Fidalgo Bay, on the western side of the
                        island of the same name; Walmouth Bight, on the southeast side of Lopez
                        Island; the Guemes Passage and Strawberry Bay, on the west side of Cypress
                        Island.</p>
                    <p rend="center">THE CANAL DE HARO.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, the Canal de Haro, from the point where the Strait of
                        Georgia may be said to lose the characteristic features of a single strait,
                        takes a direction about southwest and a halt south between the ease point of
                        Saturna Island and the small Island of Patos, for a distance of eight miles,
                        (English;) it then turns to the westward, and runs in a direction southwest
                        by west for almost an equal distance, until between Stuart and Moresby
                        Islands, where it turns to the southward, and runs for a farther distance of
                        about twenty miles, (English,) trending to the southeast, when it strikes
                        the Straits of Fuca.<seg type="margin">Chart No. 4.</seg></p>
                    <p>The width of the Canal de Haro at its northern entrance, between East Point
                        and Patos Island, is two and one-half miles, (English,) where, from the
                        strong tides and irregularity of the bottom, heavy races occur; about the
                        same width is carried tor twelve miles, (English,) when, between Turn Point
                        and Moresby *Island, it decreases to something less than two miles,
                        (English,) and the narrowest part, which is between Stuart Island and
                        Cooper’s Reef, is one and three-fourths miles, (English.) After passing
                        south of Henry Island, it gradually widens, and is more than six miles in
                        breadth when it enters the Straits of Fuca.<seg type="margin">[7]</seg></p>
                    <p>The water is deeper and the depth is more irregular in the Canal de Haro than
                        in the Rosario Strait, and though the tides run with about equal velocity in
                        both, the former is more subject to irregularities and races.</p>
                    <p>The eastern or San Juan shore of the canal is bold and steep.</p>
                    <p>After passing San Juan, when northward of Henry Island, very strong and
                        irregular tides are met with, and there are rocks off Spieden Island which
                        must not be approached too close.</p>
                    <p>Off Turn Point, on Stuart Island, there are strong whirls and eddy tides;
                        and, unless with a commanding breeze, a sailing-vessel is liable to be
                        turned round by them and lose the power of her helm.</p>
                    <p>On the western side of the canal the principal dangers are—</p>
                    <p>The Zero Rock, and its neighboring shoals in Cormorant Bay; also the Kelp
                        Reefs, which extend southward and eastward of Darcy Island.</p>
                    <p>Cormorant Bay, however, affords good anchorage. To enter it vessels may
                        safely stand in midway between Gordon Head and Zero Bock, and anchorage in
                        nine fathoms, where they will be free from any considerable tide. The Low
                        and Bare Islands, northward of Sidney Island, should not be approached very
                        close, and Cooper’s Beef should be particularly avoided. The flood-tide sets
                        strongly to the northwest through the Miner’s Channel, and sailing-vessels
                        would be very liable to be set into it during light winds.</p>
                    <p>Plumper Sound, on the northern side of the bend of the strait, between Stuart
                        Island and the east point of Saturna Island, is a good anchorage, with a
                        moderate depth of water for vessels seeking shelter, and one <pb n="65"
                            xml:id="pg_65" facs="0091"/>of the few among the group of islands, which
                        is of easy access to a sailing-vessel.</p>
                    <p>Cowlitz Bay, on the western side of Waldron *Island, is also an excellent
                        stopping place, easy of access or egress.<seg type="margin">[8]</seg></p>
                    <p>There are two small anchorages in Stuart Island, Reid and Prevost Harbors,
                        but they are only suited to small vessels or steamers.</p>
                    <p>A vessel passing through the Canal de Haro may seek shelter in any of the
                        above-mentioned anchorages, but the great depth and irregular nature of the
                        bottom would render it impossible for her to anchor anywhere in the main
                        channel.</p>
                    <p>Such is the most complete account which Her Majesty’s Government is able to
                        lay before His Imperial Majesty respecting the hydrography of the two
                        channels which are in controversy.</p>
                    <p rend="center">ORIGIN OF THE NAMES OF THE TWO CHANNELS.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the origin of the respective names of the two channels there
                        is some uncertainty. Prom an account published by Mr. Robert Greenhow, the
                        librarian of the Department of State of the United States, in his “History
                        of Oregon and California,” (Boston, 1845,) it would appear that, in the
                        summer of 1790, an attempt was made by the Spaniards to explore the waters
                        supposed to be identical with a northwest passage leading into the Polar
                        Sea, which, according to an ancient tradition, had been discovered in the
                        sixteenth century by a Greek pilot called commonly Juan de Fuca. For that
                        purpose, to quote Mr. Greenhow’s words, (History, p. 221,) “Elisa, the
                        commandant of Nootka, detached Lieutenant Quimper, in the sloop Princess
                        Royal, who traced the passage in an eastwardly direction, examining both its
                        shores to the distance of about a hundred miles from its mouth, when it was
                        observed to branch off into a number of smaller passages toward the south,
                        the east, and the north, some of which were channels between islands, while
                        others appeared to extend far into the interior. Quimper was unable, from
                        want of time, to penetrate any of these passages; and he could do no more
                        than note the positions of their entrances and of several harbors, all of
                        which are now well known, though they are generally distinguished by names
                        *different from those assigned to them by the Spaniards. Among these
                        passages and harbors were the Canal de Caamano, afterward named by Vancouver
                        Admiralty Inlet; the Boca de Flon, or Deception Passage; the Canal de
                        Guemes, and the Canal de Haro, which may still be found under those names in
                        English charts, extending northward from the eastern end of the strait; Port
                        Quadra, the Port Discovery of Vancouver, said to be one of the best harbors
                        on the Pacific side of America, with Port Quimper near it on the west; and
                        Port Nunez Gaona, called Poverty Cove by the American fur-traders, situated
                        a few miles east of Cape Flattery, where the Spaniards attempted, in 1792,
                        to form a settlement. Having performed this duty as well as possible, under
                        the circumstances in which he was placed, Quimper returned to Nootka, where
                        he arrived in the beginning of August.”<seg type="margin">[9]</seg></p>
                    <p>It is probable that it was upon the authority of Quimper, who was an ensign
                        of the royal navy of Spain, that the name of the <hi rend="italic">Canal de
                            Haro</hi> was given to the strait which separates Vancouver Island from
                        the island of San Juan, in the Spanish chart of the discoveries made on the
                        northeast coast of America, annexed to the narrative of the expedition of
                        the Spanish exploring vessels. Sutil and Mexicana, which was published at
                        Madrid in 1802, by order of the King of Spain.<seg type="margin">Chart No.

                    <p>A very brief allusion is made in the first chapter of that narrative to
                        Quimper’s expedition. He is stated to have sailed from the Port of Nootka on
                        May 31, 1790, to have reconnoitered the Port of Claucaud, (in Vancouver
                        Island,) to have entered afterward into the Canal of Fuca, to have visited
                        certain ports and part of the coast, to have taken surveys, and to have
                        retired on the 1st of August, the weather not permitting him to continue his
                            labors.<seg type="margin">Appendix No. 4.</seg></p>
                    <p>Mr. Greenhow cites, as his authority, the journal of Quimper’s voyage, among
                        the manuscripts obtained from the hydrographical department at Madrid.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, the name of <hi rend="italic">Rosario Channel</hi>
                        appears, from the narrative of the Sutil and Mexicana, to have originated
                        with Lieutenant *Elisa, who, prior to the arrival of those vessels, had
                        penetrated into the upper waters, now called the Strait of Georgia, and had
                        given to them the name of “El Canal del Rosario.” That name is accordingly
                        given to those waters in the chart which represents the course of that
                        expedition. Vancouver, on the other hand, in his chart, to which reference
                        will be made hereafter, assigns that name to certain narrow waters farther
                        north, which separate the continent from the island now called Texada. How
                        the name has come to be applied in modern days to the waters of the Strait
                        of Georgia, as they are traced southerly through the islands until they join
                        the headquarters of the Straits of Fuca, does not appear. No name was in use
                        at the time when the treaty of June 15, 1846, was concluded, to distinguish
                        these waters from the upper waters. <hi rend="italic">The fact,
                        however</hi>, <hi rend="italic">is clear</hi>, <hi rend="italic">that the

                    <p>The expedition of the Sutil and Mexicana, in 1792, appears to have ascended
                        the Straits of Fuca to its headwaters, having touched first at Port Cordova,
                        (now Esqnimalt Harbor,) at the southern extremity of Vancouver Island, It
                        thence proceeded between the Island of Bonilla (Smith’s Island) and the
                        southeast point of Lopez Island, at that time believed to be one and the
                        same island with San Juan, until it reached the mouth of the Canal de
                        Guemes, which separates the Island of Guemes from the continent. The
                        expedition then passed up that strait into the “Seno de Gaston,” now
                        Bellingham Bay, and thence along the passage which separates the island of
                        Pacheco (now Lummi Island) from the continent, into the upper waters now
                        known as the Strait of Georgia. The two vessels continued their voyage
                        onward in those waters past the promontory of Cepeda, afterward called Point
                        Roberts by Vancouver, and were employed in reconnoitering the Boca de
                        Florida, the first large inlet north of Point Roberts, when they were joined

                        of Fuca up to its headwaters, had also passed onward through the channel
                        between the the northeast point of Lopez Island and the continent; but
                        instead of directing its course eastward, like the Sutil and Mexicana, on
                        reaching Guemes Island, it continued its course northward along the main
                        channel, which separates Blakely Island from Cypress Island, and anchored in
                        Strawberry Bay.<seg type="margin">[11]</seg><seg type="margin">Chart No

                    <p>Thence it pursued its course between Orcas Island and Lummi (Pacheco) Island,
                        until it reached Birch Bay. Passing onward, it pursued a north and west
                        course past Point Roberts, and fell in with the Spanish <pb n="67"

                    <p>The narrative of Vancouver’s expedition was made public in 1798, and there
                        was annexed to it a chart, in which the course of the expedition is traced
                        through the present Rosario Strait, and soundings are given at the entrance
                        and in various parts of that strait, and in the upper waters of the ancient

                    <p>The name of the Canal de Arro appears also in this chart, assigned to the

                        the parts on the west and north shores of these waters are not shaded,
                        intimating that Vancouver derived his information from Spanish
                        authorities.</p>
                    <p>No soundings whatever are given of the Canal de Haro, either in Vancouver’s

                        down, has been the guiding chart for all British vessels navigating the
                        waters between the continent and Vancouver’s Island from 1798 until some
                        time after 1817, when a more accurate survey was made of the Strait of Fuca
                        by Captain Kellett; and there is evidence preserved in the logs of vessels
                        in the service of the Hudson’s Bay Company prior to that year that it was
                        their invariable practice to use the Rosario Strait as the leading channel
                        from Fuca’s Strait into the upper waters now known as the Strait of Georgia.
                        *Mr. Greenhow, in his “Memoir on the Northwest Coast of North America,” (New
                        York, 1840,) page 139. says that “the observations of Vancouver form the
                        basis of our best maps of the west coast of America, from the thirtieth
                        degree of latitude to the northern extremity of Cook’s inlet, as also of
                        those of the Sandwich Islands, which he surveyed with care. The maps

                            Fuca’s Strait</hi> on its way to the Pacific Ocean. On the other hand, a
                        vessel entering Fuca’s Strait from the Pacific Ocean, and <hi rend="italic"
                            >bound up the Rosario Strait</hi> by night, alter making the light upon
                        Race Island, would have to make the light upon New Dungeness, which is about
                        70 miles from Cape Flattery, and then the light upon Smith or Blunt Island,
                        which lies almost in the centre of the eastern end of Fuca’s Strait and
                        about 6 miles from the entrance of the Rosario Strait. Having made Smith’s
                        Island, the vessel may pass safely either to the northward or the southward
                        of it, according as the wind may allow. In the former case she would
                        probably have to pass within 3 miles of Cape Colville before she can enter
                        the Rosario Strait. On the other hand, if she is obliged to keep a course to
                        the southward of Smith’s Island, she would probably have to pass within 3
                        miles of Whidbey Island before she reaches the entrance of the Rosario
                        Strait. She might thus be obliged, in one or the other case, to navigate
                        within <hi rend="italic">the three miles limit</hi> On the contrary, a
                        vessel entering Fuca’s Strait from the ocean, and bound up the Canal de

                        either side of the boundary line in order to reach the entrance of the

                        of interpretation which, in the opinion of jurists of the highest authority,
                        are applicable to the interpretation of Treaties, and which, in the opinion
                        of Her Britannic Majesty’s Government, may be properly invoked to elicit the
                        true interpretation of the treaty of the 15th June, 1846.</p>

                            >[14]</seg></p>
                    <p>There are certain admitted Rules to which Her Majesty’s Government invites
                        the attention of His Imperial Majesty, as proper to be observed in the
                        interpretation of Treaties:</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The words of a Treaty are to be taken to be used in the
                            sense in which they were commonly used at the time when the Treaty was
                            entered into</hi>.</p>
                    <p>In affirmatiom of this rule, Vattel (l. ii, chap. 17, sec. 271) writes: “In
                        the interpretation of Treaties, compacts, and promises, we ought not to
                        deviate from the common use of language unless we have very strong reasons
                        for it;” and in illustration of what he means by “the common use of
                        language,” he goes on to say, in section 272, “The usage we here speak of is
                        that of the time when the Treaty or the Deed, of whatever kind, was drawn up
                        and concluded. Languages incessantly vary, and the signification and force
                        of words changes with time.”<seg type="margin">Vattel, l. ii, chap. 17, sec.

                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">In interpreting any expressions in a Treaty</hi>, <hi
                            rend="italic">regard must be had to the context and spirit of the whole
                            Treaty.</hi></p>
                    <p>In affirmation of this rule, Vattel (ibid., sec. 285) writes as follows:<seg
                            type="margin">Vattel, ibid., sec. 285.</seg></p>
                    <p>It frequently happens that, with a view to conciseness, people express
                        imperfectly, and with some degree of obscurity, things which they suppose to
                        be sufficiently elucidated by the preceding matter, or which they intend to
                        explain in the sequel; and, moreover, words and expressions have a different
                        force, sometimes even a quite different signification, according to the
                        occasion, their connection, and their relation to other words.</p>
                    <p>The connection and train of the discourse is, therefore, another source of
                        interpretation. We must consider the whole discourse together, in order
                        perfectly to conceive the sense of it, and to give to each expression not so
                        much the signification which it may individually admit of, as that which it
                        ought to have from the context and spirit of the discourse. Such is the
                        maxim of the Roman law: “Incivile est, nisi totâ lege perspectâ, unâ aliquâ
                        particulâ ejus proposita, *judicare vel respondere.”—(Digest, l. i, tit.
                        iii, De Legibus, leg. 24.)<seg type="margin">[15]</seg></p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">The interpretation should be drawn from the connection
                            and relation of the different parts.</hi></p>
                    <p>Upon this rule, Vattel (ibid., see. 286) writes as follows:<seg type="margin"
                            >Vattel, l. ii, chap. 17, sec. 286.</seg></p>
                    <p>The very connection and relation of the things in question helps also to
                        discover and establish the true sense of the Treaty or of any other piece.
                        The interpretation ought to be made in such a manner that all the parts may
                        appear consonant to each other—that what follows may agree with what
                        preceded, unless it evidently appear that, by the subsequent clauses, the
                        parties intended to make some alteration in the preceding ones. For it is to
                        be presumed that the authors of a deed had an uniform and steady train of
                        thinking; that they did not aim at inconsistencies and contradictions, but
                        rather that they intended to explain one thing by another; and, in a word,
                        that one and the same spirit reigns throughout the same production or the
                        same Treaty.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">The interpretation should be suitable to the reason of
                            the Treaty.</hi></p>
                    <p>In illustration of this rule, Vattel (ibid., sec. 287) writes:<seg
                            type="margin">Vattel, ibid., sec. 287.</seg></p>
                    <p>The reason of the law or of the Treaty—that is to say, the motive which led
                        to the making of it and the object in contemplation at the time, is the most
                        certain clue to lead us to the discovery of its true meaning; and great
                        attention should be paid to the circumstance whenever there is question
                        either of explaining an obscure, ambiguous, indeterminate passage in a law
                        or Treaty, or of applying it to a particular case. When once we certainly
                        know the reason which alone has determined the will of the person speaking,
                        we ought to interpret and apply his words in a manner suitable to that
                        reason alone; otherwise, he will be made to speak and act contrary to his
                        intention, and in opposition to his own views.</p>
                    <p>Pursuant to this rule, a prince who on granting his daughter in marriage has
                        promised to assist his intended son-in-law in all his wars, is not bound to
                        give him any assistance if the marriage does not take place.</p>
                    <p>*But we ought to be very certain that we know the true and only reason of the
                        law, the promise, or the Treaty. In matters of this nature it is not allow
                        able to indulge in vain and uncertain conjectures, and to suppose reasons
                        and views, where there are none certainly known. If the piece in question is
                        in itself obscure—if, in order to discover its meaning, we have no other
                        resource than the investigation of the author’s views or the motives of the
                        deed, we may then have recourse to conjecture, and, in default of absolute
                        certainty, adopt as the true meaning that which has the greatest degree of
                        probability on its side. But it is a dangerous abuse to go without necessity
                        in search of motives and uncertain views in order to wrest, restrict, or
                        extend the meaning of a deed, which is of itself sufficiently clear and
                        carries no absurdity on the face of it. Such a procedure is a violation of
                        that incontestable maxim, that it is not allowable to interpret what has no
                        need of interpretation.<seg type="margin">[16]</seg></p>
                    <p>It may be observed, by the way, that the motive of the High Contracting
                        Parties to the Treaty of 1846, and the object they had in view, are
                        explicitly stated in the Preamble of the Treaty, so that it will not be
                        necessary for His Imperial Majesty to travel out of the words of the Treaty
                        itself, for the purpose of ascertaining the reason of it.</p>
                    <pb n="70" xml:id="pg_70" facs="0096"/>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Treaties are to be interpreted in a favourable rather
                            than an odious sense</hi>.</p>
                    <p>In illustration of this rule Vattel (ibid., sec. 301) writes:<seg
                            type="margin">Vattel, l. ii, chap. 17, sec. 301.</seg></p>
                    <p>It will not be difficult to show in general what things are favourable, and
                        what are odious. In the first place, everything that tends to the common
                        advantage in Conventions, or that has a tendency to place the Contracting
                        Parties on a footing of equality, is favourable. The voice of equity and the
                        general rule of contracts require that the conditions between the parties
                        should be equal. We are not to presume, without very strong reasons, that
                        one of the Contracting Parties intended to favour the other to his own
                        prejudice; but there is no danger in extending what is for the common
                        advantage. If, therefore, it happens that the Contracting Parties have not
                        made known their *will with sufficient clearness, and with all the necessary
                        precision, it is certainly more conformable to equity to seek for that will
                        in the sense most favourable to equality and the common advantage, than to
                        suppose it in the contrary sense. For the same reason everything that is not
                        for the common advantage, everything that tends to destroy the equality of a
                        contract, everything that onerates only one of the parties, or that onerates
                        the one more than the other, is odious. In a Treaty of strict friendship,
                        union, and alliance, everything which, without being burdensome to any of
                        the parties, tends to the common advantage of the Confederacy, and to draw
                        the bonds of the union closer, is favourable. In unequal treaties, and
                        especially in unequal alliances, all the clauses of inequality, and
                        principally those that onerate the inferior ally, are odious. Upon this
                        principle that we ought, in cases of doubt, to extend what leads to equality
                        and restrict what destroys it, is founded that well-known rule—“Incommoda
                        vitantis melior, quam commoda petentis, est causa.” (Quinctilian, Inst.
                        Orat., l. vii, ch. iv.) The party who endeavours to avoid a loss has a
                        better cause to support than he who aims at obtaining an advantage.<seg
                            type="margin">[17]</seg></p>
                    <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Whatever interpretation tends to change the existing
                            state of things at the time the Treaty was made is to be ranked in the
                            class of odious things</hi>.</p>
                    <p>Vattel, (ibid., sec. 305,) in illustration of this rule, observes that “the
                        proprietor cannot be deprived of his right, except so far precisely as he
                        relinquishes it on his part; and in case of doubt the presumption is in
                        favour of the possessor. It is less repugnant to equity to withhold from the
                        owner a possession which he has lost through his own neglect, than to strip
                        the just possessor of what lawfully belongs to him. In the interpretation,
                        therefore, we ought rather to hazard the former inconvenience than the
                        latter. Here also may be applied in many cases the rule above-mentioned,
                        (sec. 301,) that the party who endeavours to avoid a loss has a better cause
                        to support than he who aims at obtaining an advantage.”<seg type="margin"

                    <p>(1.) Vancouver’s expedition, in 1792, after exploring the head-waters of
                        Fuca’s Strait, passed on to the northward, along the narrow waters which
                        separate Lopez Island from what was then believed to be the Continent, and
                        followed those waters in their course between Blakely Island and Cypress
                        Island into Birch Bay, and thence passed onwards to Point Roberts and the
                        upper waters of the ancient Gulf now called the Strait of Georgia. Soundings
                        were made throughout the passsage, which are stated in Vancouver’s
                        narrative, and are laid down in the chart annexed to it, sufficient to
                        secure for future navigators a safe course from Fuca’s Strait into the upper
                        Gulf. Vancouver did not explore, nor does he give any soundings of the Canal

                        appears on the face of his Chart, distinguishing waters without soundings

                        appear, from the narrative of the expedition, to have pursued *a course to
                        the southward of the San Juan Island until they reach the head-waters of
                        Fuca’s Strait. They then entered the same channel which Vancouver entered,
                        and followed it as far as the Island of Guemes, when they passed onwards,
                        along the Canal de Guemes, into Bellingham Bay, (“El Seno de Gaston.”) From
                        Bellingham Bay they pursued a northerly course past Point Roberts into the
                        upper waters of the ancient Gulf.<seg type="margin">[19]</seg><seg

                    <p>(3.) The Chart of Vancouver, which gives soundings only for navigating
                        through the Rosario Channel, was the Chart in general use up to the end of

                        navigating through the Canal de Haro.</p>

                        Company, passed up from Fuca’s Strait to Fort Langley, on the Frazer River,
                        in 1837, she made use of what is known as the Rosario Channel. She explored
                        the Canal de Haro for the first time in 1846.</p>
                    <p>(6.) When the United States exploring vessel Porpoise, under Lieutenant
                        Ringgold, passed up to the northward, from Fuca’s Straits into the upper
                        Gulf, in 1841, she made use of what is now known as the Rosario Channel. The
                        boats, on the other hand, of her consort, the Vincennes, which remained at
                        New Dungeness, were dispatched to the Canal de Haro to make a survey of it.
                        Lieutenant Wilkes, in his narrative, (vol. iv, p. 515,) states that they
                        were so engaged for three days, by which time they “completed all that was

                    <p rend="center">* THE SECOND AND THIRD RULES OF INTERPRETATION.<seg
                            type="margin">[20]</seg></p>
                    <p>It is conceived by Her Majesty’s Government that the second and third rules
                        for the interpretation of Treaties, already brought to the attention <pb
                            n="72" xml:id="pg_72" facs="0098"/>of His Imperial Majesty, as they are
                        of a cognate character, may be conveniently considered together in their
                        application to the question submitted to the arbitration of His Imperial
                        Majesty.</p>
                    <p>These rules may be, then, briefly expressed:</p>
                    <p>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) That <hi rend="italic">the context and spirit of a
                            discourse is a source of interpretation,</hi> where particular
                        expressions are obscure from over-conciseness of statement.</p>
                    <p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) The interpretation of any part of a discourse
                        ought to be made in such a manner that <hi rend="italic">all the parts may
                            be consonant to one another</hi>.</p>
                    <p>It may be observed, then, in the first place, that the only expressions in
                        the Treaty of 15th June, 1846, respecting which any disagreement has arisen
                        between the High Contracting Parties, are to be found in the second
                        paragraph of the first article of it: “And thence southerly, through the
                        middle of the said Channel, and of Fuca’s Strait, to the Pacific Ocean;” and
                        that the disagreement is limited to the words “the said Channel.” It is
                        considered, therefore, by Her Majesty’s Government that, in order to arrive
                        at the true interpretation of the above words, regard may properly be had,
                        not merely to the context of the paragraph itself, but to the text of the
                        preceding and following paragraphs of the 1st Article, which is the
                        operative part of the Treaty as regards the settlement of the line of
                            boundary.<seg type="margin">Appendix No. 2.</seg></p>
                    <p>The 1st Article, then, of the said Treaty, is divided into three
                        paragraphs:</p>
                    <p>1. From the point in the 49th parallel of north latitude, where the boundary
                        laid down in existing Treaties and Conventions between Great Britain and the
                        United States terminates, the line of boundary between the territories of
                        Her Britannic Majesty and the United States shall be continued westward
                        along the said 49th parallel of north latitude to the middle of the Channel
                        which separates the Continent from Vaneouver’s Island.</p>
                    <p>*2. And thence southerly through the middle of the said Channel and of Fuca’s
                        Straits to the Pacific Ocean.<seg type="margin">[21]</seg></p>
                    <p>3. Provided, however, that the navigation of the whole of the said Channel
                        and Straits south of the 49th parallel of north latitude remain free and
                        open to both parties.</p>
                    <p>Looking now to the text of the first paragraph of this Article in connection
                        with the second paragraph, Her Majesty’s Government submits to His Imperial
                        Majesty that the second para graph may be read as if it were written <hi
                            rend="italic">in extenso</hi> thus: “And thence southerly through the
                        middle of the Channel which separates the continent from Vancouver’s Island,
                        and through the middle of Fuca’s Straits to the Pacific Ocean,” the channel
                        and the straits being so connected in the second paragraph as to be governed
                        by the preceding words, “through the middle of.”<seg type="margin">The
                            context of the Treaty considered.</seg></p>
                    <p>Now, the extent of the waters here designated as Fuca’s Strait is not in
                        controversy. It is true, indeed, that by some writers, amongst whom may be
                        mentioned Mr. Robert Greenhow, the Librarian to the Department of State of
                        the United States, and the author of a Memoir, Historical and Political, on
                        the North-west Coast of North America, published in 1840 by direction of the
                        Senate, the term “Fuca’s Strait” has been used prior to the Treaty of 1846
                        to denote the whole of the channel through which it was supposed that the
                        Greek pilot, Juan de Fuca, found a passage into the Polar Sea in the
                        sixteenth century. Thus Mr. Greenhow, in his “History of Oregon,” (p. 29,)
                        speaking of the three great groups of islands south of 54° 40′ north
                        latitude, says, “The southernmost group embraces one large island, and an
                        infinite number of smaller <pb n="73" xml:id="pg_73" facs="0099"/>ones,
                        extending from the 49th parallel to the 51st, and separated from the
                        continent on the south and east by the channel called the Strait of Fuca.”
                        There is a slight inaccuracy, it may be observed, in this passage as regards
                        the latitude of the group of islands; but Mr. Greenhow, in a previous
                        passage of the same work, (p. 22,) has described the channel which he has in
                        view with greater accuracy, as running eastward about one hundred miles
                        between the *48th and 49th parallels of latitude, and then turning to the
                            north-west.<seg type="margin">[22]</seg></p>
                    <p>The view of Her Majesty’s Government is, that the term “Fuca’s Straits” is
                        used in the Treaty of 1846 to signify the lower portion only of Mr.
                        Greenhow’s Channel, namely, the inlet of the sea which extends eastward from
                        the Pacific Ocean to the entrance of the passage, through which Vancouver
                        continued his voyage to the northward, and which he has laid down in his
                        chart as a navigable channel, connecting Fuca’s Strait with the upper waters
                        of the ancient Gulf.</p>
                    <p>In accordance with this signification of Fuca’s Straits, Her Majesty’s
                        Government submits to His Imperial Majesty that the term “Fuca’s Straits”
                        must be taken to have been inserted in the second paragraph of the first
                        Article of the Treaty of 1846 for the sake of describing with greater
                        precision the course of the boundary line, and that it is one of the
                        necessary conditions of the boundary line that it should be drawn <hi
                            rend="italic">through the middle of the inlet of the sea</hi>, of which
                        Cape Flattery may be regarded as the south-western extremity, and Deception
                        Pass as the north-eastern extremity.</p>
                    <p>Now, a line may be properly said to be drawn through the middle of this
                        inlet, if it be drawn in either of two ways, namely, if it be drawn
                        lengthways, or if it be drawn breadthways. There can, however, be no doubt
                        as to which of such alternative lines is required to satisfy the Treaty, as
                        the line is to be drawn to the Pacific Ocean, and this can only be effected
                        by <hi rend="italic">drawing the line through the middle of Fuca’s Straits
                            lengthways.</hi> Upon this point in the case Her Majesty’s Government
                        submits to His Imperial Majesty that there can be no reasonable doubt.</p>
                    <p>Her Majesty’s Government further submits to His Imperial Majesty, that in
                        order that the second paragraph of the first Article of the Treaty of 1846
                        shall be consonant to the third paragraph—in other words, in order to
                        account for and give reasonable effect to the third paragraph, whereby the
                        navigation of <hi rend="italic">the whole of Fuca’s Straits</hi> is secured
                        to both the High Contracting Parties—the second paragraph must be
                        interpreted as *requiring the line to be drawn southerly <hi rend="italic"
                            >through the middle of a channel which will allow it to enter the
                            head-waters of Fuca’s Straits</hi>, <hi rend="italic">and to be
                            continued through the middle of the Straits in an uninterrupted line to
                            the Pacific Ocean;</hi> in other words, the boundary line, after it has
                        entered Fuca’s Straits, must divide the waters of the Straits in such a
                        manner as to render the proviso necessary which is embodied in the third
                            paragraph.<seg type="margin">The consonance of the second and third
                            paragraphs of the Treaty.</seg><seg type="margin">[23]</seg></p>
                    <p>For the purpose of bringing this part of the case more completely before the
                        mind of His Imperial Majesty, Her Majesty’s Government will recapitulate
                        briefly the characteristics of Fuca’s Straits, as they bear upon the
                        question.</p>
                    <p>The breadth, then, of Fuca’s Straits where they leave the Pacific Ocean
                        between Cape Flattery on the Continent, their southern point, and Bonilla
                        Point on Vancouver’s Island, their northern point, is thirteen miles. Within
                        these points they soon narrow to eleven miles, and carry this width on an
                        east course for forty miles. They then take an east-north-east direction to
                        the shore of Whidbey Island. Between Race Islands and the Southern shore is
                        the narrowest <pb n="74" xml:id="pg_74" facs="0100"/>part of the Straits.
                        Their least breadth, however, in this part is not less than eight miles,
                        after which the Straits expand immediately to seventeen miles, a width which
                        they maintain more or less in the part where the Canal de Haro enters them.
                        On the other hand, it is difficult to define precisely the place where the
                        waters of Fuca’s Straits merge in those of the Rosario Strait, but Fuca’s
                        Straits gradually contract as they approach the entrance of the Rosario
                        Strait, which is only five miles wide. A provision which thus secures to the
                        vessels of either nation the right of free navigation on either side of the
                        boundary line <hi rend="italic">throughout the whole of the channel and
                            Fuca’s Straits</hi>, would be perfectly intelligible, and, in fact,
                        would be a requisite precaution, if the line is to pass through Rosario
                        Strait, dividing the head-waters of Fuca’s Straits; but it would not be in
                        any such sense a <hi rend="italic">necessary precaution</hi>, if the line of
                        boundary is to be drawn through the Canal de Haro.<seg type="margin">Chart
                            No. 4.</seg></p>
                    <p>*On the former supposition it would be reasonable to secure to either party
                        the free navigation of the whole of Fuca’s Straits equally as of the Rosario
                        Channel, inasmuch as the <hi rend="italic">medium filum aquœ</hi> in the
                        uppermost part of Fuca’s Straits would be within the “three miles limit” of
                        either shore; on the other hand, the part of Fuca’s Straits, where the Canal
                        de Haro strikes them, are of so great a breadth that there would be an ample
                        margin of common navigable water for vessels on either side of the <hi
                            rend="italic">medium filum aquœ</hi>, and no necessity for vessels
                        passing to and from the Pacific Ocean <hi rend="italic">to navigate within
                            the jurisdictional waters</hi> of either of the High Contracting
                            Parties.<seg type="margin">[24]</seg><seg type="margin">Reason of the
                            third paragraph.</seg></p>
                    <p>If it should be said on behalf of the United States Government that the
                        proviso in the third paragraph of the first Article of the Treaty of 1846
                        was not inserted by way of <hi rend="italic">precaution,</hi> but rather by
                        way of <hi rend="italic">comity</hi>, to preserve to both the High
                        Contracting Parties a liberty of navigation hitherto enjoyed by them in
                        common, Her Majesty’s Government submits that considerations of <hi
                            rend="italic">comity</hi> would equally have required the extension of
                        the proviso to the waters of the Channel, which separates the continent from
                        Vancouver’s Island <hi rend="italic">north of the forty-ninth parallel of
                            north latitude</hi>, as both parties had heretofore enjoyed in common
                        the free navigation of those waters; but no such precaution has been taken
                        in the Treaty to limit the exercise of exclusive sovereignty north of the
                        forty-ninth parallel.</p>
                    <p>Again, it would have been an unreasonable thing to have provided by the
                        Treaty that both parties should retain the free enjoyment of the navigation
                        of <hi rend="italic">the whole of Fuca’s Straits</hi>, unless the Treaty is
                        to be interpreted as requiring the boundary line to be drawn through the
                        middle of those Straits, and continued through the Rosario Channel, in which
                        case the free navigation of the whole of Fuca’s Straits to the eastward of
                        the Canal de Haro would be at times a condition essentially necessary to
                        enable British or American vessels, as the case may be, to enter or leave
                        the channel connecting Fuca’s Straits with the waters of the upper Gulf. *To
                        contend, indeed, that this provision of the Treaty would be consonant to an
                        interpretation of the Treaty which would continue the boundary line through
                        the Canal de Haro, is to deprive the proviso of any rational meaning, as
                        American vessels would possess the right of navigating the Straits to the
                        eastward of the Canal de Haro without any such proviso, and British vessels
                        would not require any such liberty to enable them to enter or leave the
                        Channel through which the boundary line is to pass from Fuca’s Straits into
                        the waters of the upper Gulf.<seg type="margin">[25]</seg></p>

                    <p rend="center">THE FOURTH RULE OF INTERPRETATION.</p>
                    <p>The fourth of the rules to which Her Britannic Majesty’s Government has
                        invited the attention of His Imperial Majesty is, that <hi rend="italic">the
                            interpretation should he suitable to the reason of the Treaty</hi>, that
                        is to say, the motive which led to the making of it, and the object in
                        contemplation at the time.</p>
                    <p>“We ought,” says Vattel, (section 287,) “to be very certain that we know the
                        true and only reason of the law, or the Treaty. In matters of this nature it
                        is not allowable to indulge in vague and uncertain conjectures, and to
                        suppose reasons and views where there are none certainly known. If the piece
                        in question is in itself obscure; if, in order to discover its meaning, we
                        have no other resource than the investigation of the author’s views or the
                        motives of the deed, we may then have recourse to conjecture, and in default
                        of absolute certainty adopt, as the true meaning, that which has the
                        greatest degree of probability on its side. But it is a dangerous abuse to
                        go without in search of motives and uncertain views in order to wrest,
                        restrict, or extend the meaning of the deed, which is of itself sufficiently
                        clear, and carries no absurdity on the face of it.”</p>
                    <p>Now, the motive of the Treaty, as recited in the Preamble of it, was to
                        terminate a state of doubt and uncertainty, which had hitherto prevailed
                        respecting the sovereignty and government of the territory on the north-west
                        coast of America, lying westward of the Rocky Mountains, by an *amicable
                        compromise of the rights mutually asserted by the two parties over the said
                            territory.<seg type="margin">The motive of the Treaty.</seg><seg
                            type="margin">[26]</seg></p>
                    <p>It is a reasonable presumption from this Preamble that Her Britannic
                        Majesty’s Government, which drew up the paragraph of the Treaty of 1846, the
                        meaning of which is in controversy, <hi rend="italic">had a definite
                            boundary line in view</hi>, which would terminate all doubt and
                        uncertainty as to the limits within which the respective Parties to the
                        Treaty were henceforth to exercise rights of sovereignty.</p>
                    <p>The Treaty of 1846, it should also be borne in mind, was not an ordinary
                        Treaty of friendship or alliance, in which a paragraph respecting mutual
                        boundaries was inserted amongst paragraphs relevant to other matters; but it
                        was a Treaty, of which <hi rend="italic">the primary object was the
                            settlement of a boundary line</hi>, and it would be unreasonable to
                        attach a vague and uncertain meaning to any words descriptive of the
                        boundary line, if such words are susceptible of a <hi rend="italic">definite
                            and certain meaning</hi>.</p>
                    <p>It is not too much to say, and it will probably not be disputed—for it has
                        been so stated by one of the most eminent of American statesmen—that the
                        great aim of the United States in 1846 was to establish the 49th parallel of
                        north latitude as the line of boundary on the western side of the Rocky
                        Mountains, “<hi rend="italic">not to be de parted from for any line further
                            south on the Continent;</hi>” and that with regard to straits, sounds,
                        and islands in the neighbouring seas, they were subjects of minor
                        importance, to be dealt with in a spirit of fairness and equity. (Speech of
                        Mr. Webster before the Senate of the United States, March 30, 1846.)<seg

                    <p>On the other hand, it is notorious, and it is also patent on the face of the
                        Treaty itself, that the great aim of Her Britannic Majesty’s Government was
                        to meet the views of the United States Government in regard to the 49th
                        parallel of north latitude with <hi rend="italic">as little sacrifice as
                            possible of the rights heretofore enjoyed by the Hudson’s Bay Company
                            and other British subjects in the waters south of that
                        parallel.</hi></p>
                    <pb n="76" xml:id="pg_76" facs="0102"/>
                    <p>Now, it is a remarkable feature of the Treaty that <hi rend="italic">no name
                            is given to the Channel</hi>, to the *middle of which the 49th parallel
                        of north latitude was to be continued after leaving the Continent, and
                        through the middle of which it was to be drawn southerly after being
                        deflected from that parallel. The Channel is described as “the Channel
                        separating the continent from Vancouver’s Island,” and the line is simply
                        directed to be drawn “southerly through the middle of the said Channel and
                        of Fuca’s Straits.” The presumption arising from this description of it is
                        that <hi rend="italic">the Channel intended by the Treaty was the only
                            Channel then used by sea-going vessels, and that it had no
                            distinguishing name</hi>, but that upon the face of the charts then in
                        use it would readily answer the description given of it in the Treaty, and
                        would admit of the boundary line being deflected and continued through the
                        middle of it and of Fuca’s Straits to the Pacific Ocean.<seg type="margin"
                            >[27]</seg><seg type="margin">No name is given to the Channel.</seg></p>
                    <p>It will be seen by His Imperial Majesty, on an examination of Van couver’s
                        Chart, which was the most accurate chart known to Her Britannic Majesty’s
                        Government at the time when the Treaty was made, and which was the Chart
                        under the consideration of Her Britannic Majesty’s Government when they
                        framed the first Article of the Treaty, that the name of the Gulf of Georgia
                        is assigned in that Chart <hi rend="italic">to the whole of the interior
                            sea</hi>, which separates the Continent from the group of islands, the
                        chief of which is called Quadra and Vancouver’s Island, such being the name
                        of the largest island at the time when the chart was constructed, and that
                            <hi rend="italic">no distinguishing name</hi> is assigned either to the
                            <hi rend="italic">channel</hi> up which Vancouver sailed to the
                        northward, or to the portion of the Gulf in the 49th parallel of north
                        latitude. Her Majesty’s Government accordingly contends, (1,) that the
                        boundary line, which is directed by the Treaty to be continued westward
                        along the 49th parallel of north latitude to the middle of a channel without
                        any distinguishing name, and thence southerly through the middle of the said
                        channel and of Fuca’s Straits, is intended by the words of the Treaty to be
                        drawn through the middle of a channel which had, at that time, no
                        distinguishing name; and (2) that, as the channel now called the Rosario
                        *Strait is found in the charts of the period (1846) without any
                        distinguishing name assigned to it, and in other respects corresponding with
                        the requirements of the Treaty, such channel ought to be preferred to the
                        Canal de Haro, which bore a distinguishing name at that period.<seg
                            type="margin">Chart No. 2.</seg><seg type="margin">[28]</seg></p>
                    <p>Her Britannic Majesty’s Government contends, on this part of the case, that
                        to draw the line through the middle of the waters distinguished in
                        Vancouver’s Chart from the Channel, through which he sailed, by the name of
                        the “Canal de Arro,” and which waters are represented in that chart as
                        unsurveyed, would be to continue the line not through “the said
                        Channel”—that is, a Channel without any distinguishing name—but through a
                        channel which, at the time the Treaty was made, was distinguished by name
                        from the channel surveyed by Vancouver. No reason can well be assigned, if
                        such a channel was contemplated by both parties, why it should not have been
                        designated by its distinguishing name to prevent all uncertainty.</p>
                    <p>But it may be said that there is evidence that the Canal de Haro was
                        contemplated by the United States Government, and that they had charts in
                        their possession which satisfied them that it was a navigable and safe
                        channel, equally as the channel along which Vancouver sailed. The reply to
                        such an argument is not far to seek. If it can be established that one of
                        the parties to the Treaty had knowledge only of one navigable Channel
                        corresponding to the provisions of the Treaty, the fact <pb n="77"
                            xml:id="pg_77" facs="0103"/>that the other party was aware of another
                        navigable Channel could never justify such an interpretation being given to
                        the Treaty as should bind the former to accept the Treaty in a sense of
                        which it did not know it to be capable, when the Treaty may be interpreted
                        in a sense in which both parties were aware that it was capable of being
                        interpreted. <hi rend="italic">The reason of the thing</hi> is against such
                        an interpretation as has been proposed to be given to the Treaty on the part
                        of the United States Government.</p>
                    <p>There is a further reason why the Canal de Haro does not satisfy the language
                        of the Treaty.</p>
                    <p>The commencement of the boundary line, which is to be drawn southerly, is
                        described in *the Treaty as being in a Channel under the 49th parallel of
                        north latitude; but a glance at the chart will satisfy His Imperial Majesty
                        that the Canal de Haro cannot, in any proper sense of the words, be held to
                        commence under that parallel. It has a distinct commencement between Saturna
                        Island and Patos Island, under a lower parallel. <hi rend="italic">It
                            has</hi>, <hi rend="italic">therefore</hi>, <hi rend="italic">not only a
                            distinguishing name</hi>, <hi rend="italic">hut it has its physical
                            characteristics which distinguish it</hi> from the channel described in
                        the Treaty of 1846 as identical with the channel under the 49th parallel of
                        north latitude.<seg type="margin">[29]</seg></p>
                    <p rend="center">THE FIFTH RULE OF INTERPRETATION.</p>
                    <p>The fifth rule of interpretation, to which Her Britannic Majesty’s Government
                        has invited the attention of His Imperial Majesty, is, that <hi

                    <p>“We are not to presume,” says Vattel, (sec. 30.) “without any strong reasons,
                        that one of the Contracting Parties intended to favour the other to his own
                        prejudice, but there is no danger in extending what is for the common

                    <p>Now, it may be stated by Her Majesty’s Government without fear of
                        contradiction, that, at the time when the Treaty of 1846 was signed at
                        Washington, no charts were in use by those who navigated the interior sea
                        between the Continent and Vancouver’s Island, but Vancouver’s Chart and
                        possibly a Spanish Chart, purporting to be constructed in 1795 upon the
                        surveys made by the Sutil and Mexicana. Of the latter chart, indeed, Her
                        Britannic Majesty’s Government had no certain knowledge in 1846, for the
                        only Spanish chart of those waters, which is to be found in the archives of
                        the British Admiralty at Whitehall, did not come into its possession until
                        1849. In neither, however, of those Charts are *there are any soundings of a
                        navigable passage through the Canal de Haro. It is true, indeed, that in the
                        Spanish Chart some soundings are given of Cordova Channel, in which the
                        boats of the Sutil and Mexicana appear to have crept close along the shore;
                        but there are no soundings to guide a vessel out of the Canal de Haro into
                        any part of the upper waters, which are south of 49° parallel of north
                        latitude. An interpretation, therefore, of the Treaty, which would declare
                        the Canal de Haro to be the channel down which the boundary line is to be
                        carried, would be to declare that Her Britannic Majesty’s Government, when
                        it concluded the Treaty of 1846, <hi rend="italic">intended to favour the
                            United States Government to its own prejudice;</hi> for it would be to

                        which it had no assurance that it was even navigable in its upper waters for
                        sea-going vessels; nay, respecting which it is not too much to say that Her
                        Britannic Majesty’s Government <hi rend="italic">had a firm belief that it
                            was a dangerous strait.</hi> On the other hand, an interpretation which
                        would declare Vancouver’s Channel, now distinguished by the name of the

                        of a Channel, which was known to both Parties at the time when the Treaty
                        was made to be a navigable and safe channel. The two Parties in respect of
                        such an interpretation would be placed in a position of equality.<seg

                    <p>The sixth Rule of Interpretation, which is a corollary to the next preceding
                        Rule, and which is also submitted to the attention of His Imperial Majesty,
                        is that, <hi rend="italic">in case of doubt, the presumption is in favour of
                            the possessor of a thing</hi>; in other words, the party who endeavours
                        to avoid a loss has a better cause to support than he who aims at obtaining
                        an advantage.<seg type="margin">The presumption is in favour of the
                            possessor of a thing.</seg></p>
                    <p>It has been already said that the Channel in use in 1846, and the only
                        Channel in use by *British vessels navigating from the Straits of Fuca to
                        the stations of the Hudson’s Bay Company on Frazer’s River, and elsewhere
                        north of the 49th parallel of north latitude, was the channel surveyed by
                        Vancouver, and of which soundings are given in his Chart.<seg type="margin"

                    <p>The Government of the United States contends tor an interpretation of the
                        Treaty <hi rend="italic">which will dispossess British vessels of the use of
                            this channel</hi>. There is no evidence, on the other hand, that the
                        Canal de Haro was used by vessels of the United States prior to the Treaty
                        of 1846.</p>
                    <p>Her Britannic Majesty’s Government, on the other hand, is not contending for
                        an interpretation of the Treaty which will deprive the citizens of the
                        United States of any right habitually exercised by them prior to the Treaty.
                        If, indeed, the United States Government had knowledge from unpublished
                        surveys or otherwise, prior to the Treaty of 1846, that the Canal de Haro
                        was a navigable and safe channel, it cannot be denied that citizens of the
                        United States, if they used any channel at all prior to 1846, made use of
                        the channel now called the Rosario Strait. It is submitted accordingly to
                        His Imperial Majesty, that an interpretation of the Treaty, which declares
                        the Rosario Strait to be the channel, through the middle of which the
                        boundary line is to be drawn, will continue to American citizens the full
                        enjoyment of such rights of navigation as were exercised by them prior to
                        the Treaty, whilst a declaration in favour of the claim of the United States
                        will strip British subjects of corresponding rights. <hi rend="italic"
                            >Wherever there is doubtful right</hi>, it is less <hi rend="italic"
                            >repugnant to equity to withhold from a claimant the enjoyment of a
                            thing</hi>, <hi rend="italic">which he has never possessed</hi>, <hi
                            rend="italic">than to strip the possessor of a thing of which he has
                            habitually had the enjoyment.</hi></p>
                    <p>The question whether any third channel, other than the Rosario Strait or the
                        Canal de Haro, would satisfy the requirements of the Treaty of 1846, has not
                        been touched upon by Her Britannic Majesty’s Government for these
                        reasons—amongst others, that the existence of any intermediate navigable
                        channel was unknown to both the Contracting Parties at the time when the
                        Treaty of *1846 was signed, and the Government of the United States has
                        never contended <pb n="79" xml:id="pg_79" facs="0105"/>for any such channel.
                        Besides, Her Britannic Majesty’s Government presumes that the true
                        interpretation of the Treaty of 1846 is to be sought <hi rend="italic">rebus
                            sic stantibus</hi>, that is, upon the state of facts known to both
                        parties at the time when the Treaty of 1846 was concluded.<seg type="margin"
                            >[32]</seg></p>
                    <p>On the above considerations of fact and of public law, Her Britannic
                        Majesty’s Government submits to His Imperial Majesty that the claim of Her
                        Britannic Majesty’s Government that the portion of the boundary line which,
                        under the terms of the Treaty of 15th June, 1846, runs southerly through the
                        middle of the Channel which separates the Continent from Vancouver Island,
                        should be run through the Rosario Strait, is valid, and ought to be
                        preferred to the claim of the Government of the United States, that it
                        should be run through the Canal de Haro.</p>
                    <p rend="center">RECAPITULATION OF FACTS.</p>
                    <p>The considerations of fact may be briefly recapitulated:</p>
                    <p>1. That the Channel now designated as the Rosario Strait in British charts,
                        which designation embraced the Channel to the north as well as the south of
                        the 49th parallel of north latitude in Spanish charts, was the only Channel
                        between the Continent and Vancouver Island generally known and commonly used
                        by sea-going vessels at the time when the Treaty of 15th June, 1846, was
                        made, and that the words “The Channel,” in the signification which <hi
                            rend="italic">common usage</hi> affixed to them at that time, denoted
                        those waters.</p>
                    <p>2. That the context of the first and second paragraphs of Article 1 of the
                        Treaty of 15th June, 1846, requires that the boundary line should be
                        continued through the middle of a Channel <hi rend="italic">so as to enter
                            the head waters of Fuca’s Straits</hi>, which is practicable, if the
                        line should be run through the Rosario Strait, but is impracticable if it
                        should be run through the Canal de Haro.<seg type="margin">Appendix No.
                            2.</seg></p>
                    <p>*3. That the proviso in the third paragraph of Article I, which secures to
                        either Party the free navigation of <hi rend="italic">the whole of Fuca’s
                            Straits</hi>, is intelligible, as a necessary precaution, if the
                        boundary line is to be run through the Rosario Strait, but is unnecessary
                        and unreasonable if the boundary line is to be run through the Canal de
                            Haro.<seg type="margin">[33]</seg></p>
                    <p>4. That a boundary line run through the middle of the Channel now called the
                        Rosario Strait satisfies the great aim which either party had in view prior
                        to the conclusion of the Treaty 15th June, 1846; and as that Channel had no
                        distinguishing name at the time when the Treaty was made, <hi rend="italic"
                            >it could not be otherwise described than as it is described in the
                            Treaty</hi>. On the other hand, the Canal de Haro had a distinguishing
                        name, and there was no reason, if the Canal de Haro was contemplated by both
                        the High Contracting Parties at the time when the Treaty was made, why it
                        should not have been described by its distinguishing name to prevent all
                        uncertainty.</p>
                    <p>5. That a line of boundary run through the middle of the Rosario Strait, in
                        accordance with the knowledge which both the High Contracting Parties
                        possessed at the time when the Treaty of 15th June, 1846, was made, would
                        have been favourable to both Parties, whereas a line of boundary run through
                        the Canal de Haro <hi rend="italic">would have deprived Her Britannic
                            Majesty of a right of access to her own possessions</hi> through the
                        only then known navigable and safe channel.</p>
                    <p>6. That it is more in accordance with equity that His Imperial Majesty should
                        pronounce in favour of the claim of Her Britannic Majesty’s Government than
                        in favour of the claim of the Government of the United <pb n="80"
                            xml:id="pg_80" facs="0106"/>States, as a decision of His Imperial
                        Majesty declaring the Rosario Strait to be the Channel through which the
                        boundary line is to be run will continue to citizens of the United States
                        the free use of the only Channel navigated by their vessels prior to the
                        Treaty of 15th June, 1846; whilst a declaration of His Imperial Majesty in
                        favour of the claim of the Government of the United States <hi rend="italic"
                            >will deprive British subjects of rights of navigation</hi> *<hi
                            rend="italic">of which they have had the habitual enjoyment</hi> from
                        the time when the Rosario Strait was first explored and surveyed by
                            Vancouver.<seg type="margin">[34]</seg></p>
                    <p>The evidence which Her Britannic Majesty’s Government has thought it proper
                        to offer to the consideration of His Imperial Majesty in support of the
                        present case, has, for the convenience of His Imperial Majesty, been

                            the United States and those of Her Britannic Majesty, from the point on
                            the 49th parallel of north latitude up to which it has already been
                            ascertained, should be continued westward along the said parallel of

                            Puget Sound and Admiralty Inlet.<seg type="margin">May 19,

                        <p>On the 30th May Captain Vancouver quitted Restoration Point and directed
                            his course to the opening under examination by Mr. Broughton, who
                            commanded the Chatham, the entrance to which lies from Restoration Point
                            N. 20 E., 5 leagues distant, and there anchored for the night.<seg

                        <p>On the 31st May he again weighed anchor, and on the 2nd June Captain
                            Vancouver anchored his vessels, in 50 fathoms water, in a branch of the
                            Admiralty Inlet, which he called Possession Sound, distinguishing its
                            western arm by the name of Port Gardner, and its smaller or eastern one
                            by that of Port Susan.<seg type="margin">May 31, 1792, page

                        <p>On the 5th June the expedition quitted Possession Sound and anchored the

                        <p>On the 6th June the vessels worked out of the inlet, and reached its
                            entrance at a point to which Captain Vancouver gave the name of Point
                            Partridge, and, proceeding northward, after advancing a few miles along
                            the eastern shore of the Gulf, the expedition was obliged to anchor in
                            20 fathoms water, finding no effect from the ebb or flood tides, and the
                            wind being light from the northward.<seg type="margin">June 6, 1792,

                            west point of Admiralty Inlet, which, after my much esteemed friend,

                            continental shore by the boats, which, from Mr. Broughton, who had
                            visited it, obtained the name of Strawberry Bay, N. 11 W., at the
                            distance of about 6 leagues, situated in a region apparently much broken
                            and divided by water. Here we remained until 7 in the evening. We then
                            weighed, butwith so little wind that, after having drifted to the
                            southward of our former station, we were obliged again to anchor until 6
                            the next morning, when we made an attempt to proceed, but were soon
                            again compelled to become stationary near our last situation.”<seg

                        <p>“On the 7th June,” Captain Vancouver continues, “about 6 in the evening,
                            with a light breeze from the S. W., we weighed and stood to the
                            northward; but after having advanced about eleven miles, the wind became
                            light, and obliged us to anchor about 9 that evening, in 37 fathoms of
                            water, hard bottom, in some places rocky; in this situation we were
                            detained by calms until the afternoon of the following day. Our observed
                            latitude here was 48° 29′, longitude 237° 29′; the country occupying the
                            northern horizon in all directions appeared to be excessively broken and
                            insular. Strawberry Bay bore by compass N. 10 W. about three leagues
                            distant; the opening on the continental shore, the first object for the
                            examination of the detached party, with some small rock islets before
                            its entrance that appeared very narrow, bore, at the distance of about
                            five miles, S. 37 E.; Point Partridge, S. 21 E.; the low sandy island,
                            south; the south part of the westernmost shore, which is composed of
                            islands and rocks, S. 37 W., about two miles distant; the nearest shore
                            was within about a mile; a very dangerous sunken rock, visible only at
                            low tide, lies off from a low rocky point on this shore, bearing N. 79
                            W.; and a very unsafe cluster of small rocks, some constantly, and
                            others visible only near low water, bore N. 15 W. about two and a half
                            miles distant.<seg type="margin">June, 1792, page 293.</seg><seg

                        <p>“This country presented a very different aspect from that which we had
                            been accustomed to behold further south. The shores now before us were
                            composed of steep, rugged rocks, whose surface varied exceedingly in
                            respect to height, and exhibited little more than the barren rock, which
                            in some places produced a little herbage of a dull colour, with a few
                            dwarf trees.</p>
                        <p>“With a tolerably good breeze from the north we weighed about 3 in the
                            afternoon, and with a flood tide turned up into Strawberry Bay, where in
                            about three hours we anchored in 16 fathoms, fine sandy bottom. This bay
                            is situated on the west side of an island which, producing an abundance
                            of upright cypress, obtained the name of Cypress Island. The bay is of
                            small extent, and not very deep; its south point bore by compass S. 40
                            E.; a small islet, forming nearly the north point of the bay, round
                            which is a clear good passage west; and the bottom of the bay east, at a
                            distance of about three-quarters of a mile. This situation, though very
                            commodious in respect to the shore, is greatly exposed to the winds and
                            sea in a S.SE. direction.”</p>
                        <p>In consequence of the anchorage being much exposed, Captain Vancouver
                            resolved to proceed with his vessels up the gulf to the northwest in
                            quest of a more commodious situation.<seg type="margin">June 11, 1792,

                        <p>“With a light breeze from the SE., about 4 o’clock the next morning,”
                            (11th June,) Captain Vancouver states, “we quitted this station, and
                            passed between the small island and the north point of the bay to <pb
                                n="87" xml:id="pg_87" facs="0113"/>the north westward, through a
                            cluster of numerous islands, rocks, and rocky islets. On Mr. Broughton’s
                            first visit hither he found a quantity of very excellent strawberries,
                            which gave it the name of Strawberry Bay; but, on our arrival, the fruit
                            season was passed. The bay affords good and secure anchorage, though
                            sometimes exposed; yet, in fair weather, wood and water may be easily
                            procured. The island of Cypress is principally composed of high, rocky
                            mountains, and steep perpendicular cliffs, which, in the centre of
                            Strawberry Bay, fall a little back, and the space between the foot of
                            the mountains and the sea-side is occupied by low, marshy land, through
                            which are several runs of most excellent water, that find their way into
                            the bay by oozing through the beach. It is situated in latitude 48°
                            36½′, longitude 237° 34′. The variation of the compass, by eighteen sets
                            of azimuths, differing from 18° to 21°, taken on board and on shore,
                            since our departure from Admiralty Inlet, gave the mean result of 19° 5′
                            eastwardly. The rise and fall of the tide was inconsiderable, though the
                            stream was rapid. The ebb came from the east, and it was high water 2h.
                            37m. after the moon had passed the meridian.</p>
                        <p>“We proceeded first to the north-eastward, passing the branch of the
                            gulph that had been partly examined, and then directed our course to the
                            north-westward, along that which appeared a continuation of the
                            continental shore, formed by low sandy cliffs, rising from a beach of
                            sand and stones. The country, moderately elevated, stretched a
                            considerable distance from the north-westward round to the
                            south-eastward, before it ascended to join the range of rugged, snowy
                            mountains. This connected barrier, from the base of Mount Baker, still
                            continued very lofty, and appeared to extend in a direction leading to
                            the westward of north. The soundings along the shore were regular, from
                            12 to 25 and 30 fathoms, as we approached or increased our distance from
                            the land, which seldom exceeded two miles; the opposite of the gulph to
                            the south-westward, composed of numerous islands, was at a distance of
                            about two leagues. As the day advanced, the south-east wind gradually
                            died away, and for some hours we remained nearly stationary.</p>
                        <p>“In the evening, a light breeze favouring the plan I had in
                            contemplation, we steered for a bay that presented itself, where about 6
                            o’clock we anchored in 6 fathoms of water, sandy bottom, half a mile
                            from the shore. The points of the bay bore by compass S. 32 W. and N. 72
                            W.; the westernmost part of that which we considered to be the main land
                            west, about three leagues distant; to the south of this point appeared
                            the principal direction of the gulph though a very considerable arm
                            seemed to branch from it to the north-eastward. As soon as the ship was
                            secured, I went in a boat to inspect the shores of the bay, and found,
                            with little trouble, a very convenient situation for our several very
                            necessary duties on shore; of which the business of the observatory was
                            my chief object, as I much wished for a further trial of the rate of
                            chronometers, now that it was probable that we should remain at rest a
                            sufficient time to make the requisite observations for that purpose. Mr.
                            Broughton received my directions to this effect, as also that the
                            vessels should be removed, the next morning, about a mile further up the
                            bay to the north-east, where they would be more conveniently stationed
                            for our several operations on shore; and as soon as the business of the
                            observatory should acquire a degree of forward*ness, Mr. Whidby, in the
                            Discovery’s cutter, attended by the Chatham’s launch, was to proceed to
                            the examination of that part of the coast unexplored to the
                            south-eastward; whilst myself in the yawl, accompanied by Mr. Puget in
                            the launch, directed our researches up the main inlet of the gulph.”<seg

                                    when the sea-breeze set in from W.S.W. It freshened in the

                                        the preceding years, they had not examined the mouths of

                                        mouths of Carmelo and of Mazarredo. From the information
                                        which they had obtained from the Indians, that of Caamaño
                                        went far inland, but its depth did not allow a passage
                                        except to canoes. That of Flon was of very little
                                        importance. They thought, though with some doubt, that the
                                        Bay of Gaston was closed; and they proposed, as the survey
                                        of most interest, that of the mouth of Floridablanca, which,
                                        as shown on the chart which they had drawn of those
                                        channels, presented two inlets formed by an island sit uated
                                        in its centre, which, after our examination, was found to be
                                        the peninsula of Cepeda and Lángara. The channel, as they
                                        had understood from the Indians, penetrated far. * * * *</p>

                                    probable. The direction of the Channel of Caamaño towards the
                                    south, and the probability of its issuing at the mouth of Ezeta,
                                    near 46° 14′ latitude, was another of the considerations which

                                <cell>At 12 o’clock began a slack wind from S. E. The clear weather
                                    indicated that the W. would prevail in the channel. At half past

                                    channel which there is to the E. of the islet in the mouth. This
                                    channel is very narrow, on account of the reefs which issue from
                                    the points which form it, and, therefore, it ought only to be
                                    followed in a case of necessity, or if it appears decidedly
                                    advantageous. To us it appeared that we were advancing the
                                    navigation, for we thought of following the south coast of the
                                    strait, because it had plenty of excellent anchorages. *</cell>

                                    to stay, and to which he gave the name of Chachimutupusas.
                                    Tetacus had slept quietly all night, never belying his frankness
                                    and confidence; his behaviour gave continual proofs of his easy
                                    comprehension; he understood on the chart the configuration of
                                    the strait and the islands discovered, and he told us the names
                                    which he gave them. When the Point of Moreno de la Vega was
                                    doubled he advised us to take water there, as it was excellent
                                    and abundant, but after passing that place the springs were
                                    scanty, and the water of bad taste. He ate what was given to him
                                    with decency, imitating our actions, which he always carefully
                                    observed in all things. He remembered the names of all the
                                    English and Spanish captains who had visited the coast of the
                                    mainland and the archipelagos of Claucuad and Nootka, and he
                                    also informed us that there were two large vessels within the

                                    marea favorable; el cielo estaba nublado, y el horizonte apenas
                                    era de una milla. Ceñimos el viento para atravesar á la costa
                                    del E., no solo para seguirla y no perder la boca del Canal de
                                    Güemes, que va por entre la isla de este nombre y la costa, sino

                                    ventolina: arribamos al paso que nos acercábamos á la costa del
                                    E., y costeamos las dos Islas Morros con el auxilio de la
                                    virazon que apuntó por el S. desde las ocho de la mañana,
                                    despejando el cielo. Llegamos á la punta S.O. del Canal de
                                    Güemes, y entramos en él, navegando al principio á medio *freo
                                    para libertarnos de la calma de la costa; pero ya dentro tomó el
                                    viento su direccion, y nos acercamos á la del Sur para
                                    libertarnos de la fuerza de la corriente contraria, que sempre
                                    contrarestamos con mucha ventaja, pues aunque el viento estaba
                                    flojo, andábamos tres millas y media por hora. La navegacion era
                                    muy agradable, por lo frondoso de la costas. En la del N., que á
                                    la entrada es de playa, vimos una rancheria próxîma á la punta
                                    N.O., que examinada con el anteojo se halló consistir en dos
                                    casas grandes; varios Indios corriéron á la playa, se embarcáron
                                    en una canoa, y se dirigieron á las goletas, dándoles caza con

                                <cell>At 7 in the morning a breeze was felt from S.S.E.; with it we
                                    set sail to avail ourselves of the remainder of the favourable
                                    tide; the sky was cloudy, and the horizon scarcely a mile. We
                                    hugged the wind to cross to the east coast, not only in order to
                                    follow it and not to lose the mouth of the channel of Güemes,
                                    which runs between the island of that name and the coast, but
                                    also to double the islets which are in the middle of the channel
                                    in which we were, and upon which the current was driving us with
                                    rapidity. In proportion as we were getting into mid-channel the
                                    breeze freshened and veered aft; we bore away whilst we neared
                                    the eastern coast, and we coasted along the two Morros Islands
                                    with the aid of the breeze, which was direct S. from 8 in the
                                    morning, and cleared the sky. We reached the S.W. point of the
                                    channel of Güemes, and we entered it, navigating at first in
                                    mid-channel to avoid the calm of the coast; but when within, the
                                    wind took its direction, and we neared that of the S. to avoid
                                    the force of the contrary current, which we always resisted with
                                    great advantage, for although the wind was slack we went three
                                    miles and a half an hour. The navigation was very pleasant from
                                    the woodiness of the coasts. On that of the N., which at the
                                    entrance is a beach, we saw a station near the N.W. point,
                                    which, on being examined with a telescope, was seen to consist
                                    of two large houses; several Indians ran to the beach, embarked
                                    in a canoe, and made for the schooners, giving them chase with
                                    as much skill as the most expert seaman. * * * Meanwhile we
                                    followed the south coast of the channel in five fathoms of
                                    water, sandy bottom, to the S.E. point, and from that we crossed
                                    it towards the N.E. point, from which we passed at a very short
                                    distance to follow the coast of the Island of Güemes, and by
                                    that and the “Three Sisters” to make for the Bay of

                                    contrarestando algunas ventolinas escasas del O.S.O que se

                                <cell>As soon as we doubled the N.E. point we were becalmed, and it
                                    was necessary to resort to the oars to make the passage,
                                    resisting some scanty breezes from W.S.W. which opposed us; but
                                    as soon as we passed the islands the wind veered to the W., and
                                    we hauled free to port to double the Point of Solano. The heat
                                    was very distressing, for, although the thermometer in the shade
                                    was at the temperate degree, when exposed to the sun it rose to
                                    29½ degrees, and would even have risen higher if we had not gone
                                    out to meet the current of the wind.</cell>

                                    internamos en el Seno de Gaston, que aunque no estaba del todo
                                    reconocido, costeamos su parte E. para dirigirnos á su fondo, y
                                    ver si tenia en él algun canal. El viento fué refrescando, y
                                    favorecidos de él, estábamos al anochecer satisfechos de que,
                                    cuando mas, habria un rio pequeño en su parte interior. La costa
                                    que lo formaba era de tierra baja y anegadiza, que corria por
                                    entre dos lomas, y á alguna distancia aparentaban canal; el
                                    fondo era de seis á siete brazas, piedra, y pensábamos bordear
                                    para echarnos fuera, cuando caimos en cinco greda dura, por lo
                                    que se prefirió fondear contando, como hasta entonces habiamos
                                    visto, que el viento se quedaria en la noche. La situacion era
                                    buena para dejar caer el ancla, y poder reconocer mas
                                    prolijamente la parte interior de la ensenada en la mañana
                                    siguiente. Aferramos todo aparejo, avisó el timonel de la Sutil
                                    de cuatro brazas de fondo, y se dejó caer el ancla; pero despues
                                    de arriar treinta brazas de cable, se halló la goleta en dos y
                                    media de agua.</cell>
                                <cell>At 5 o’clock the wind settled from the S.; we made our course,
                                    and we went into the Bay of Gaston. Although it was not at all
                                    surveyed, we coasted along its eastern part, in order to make
                                    for its extremity, and to see if there was any channel in it.
                                    The wind still freshened, and, favoured thereby, we were by
                                    nightfall satisfied that it could have, at most, but a small
                                    river in its inner part. The coast which formed it was of low,
                                    inundated land, which ran between two hillocks, and at some
                                    distance they appeared to be a channel. The depth was from 6 to
                                    7 fathoms, stony, and we were about to tack to get out, when we
                                    fell into 5 fathoms hard chalk, wherefore it was thought best to
                                    anchor, reckoning, as we had found until then, that the wind
                                    would continue in the night. The situation was favourable for
                                    casting anchor and for examining more carefully the inner part
                                    of the inlet on the following morning. We made all fast, the
                                    steersman of the Sutil notified 4 fathoms depth, and the anchor
                                    was dropped, but, after paying out 30 fathoms of cable, the
                                    schooner was found to be in 2 and a half fathoms of
                                    water.</cell>

                                    conoció que el ancla habia caido en tres. Esta equivocacion del
                                    timonel nos puso en muy mala situacion. Se pasó la noche con
                                    cuidado, y durante toda ella vació el agua, de suerte que al
                                    amanecer estábamos en una braza y media. Habiamos visto
                                    claridades al S.E. de la montaña del Carmelo, y aun á veces
                                    algunas llamaradas, señales que no dejáron duda que hay volcanos
                                    con fuertes erupciones en aquellas cercanías. La Mejicana habia
                                    fondeado como dos cables mas al O., y en media braza menos de

                                    Dió una espía inmediatemente con su lancha, y sobre ella trató
                                    de dar la vela sin largar el cabo hasta estar en viento. *Entre
                                    tanto la Sutil se llamó á pique del ancla, y se halló en dos
                                    brazas de agua; se estaba metiendo el bote para dar la vela
                                    quando avertimos que la Mejicana habia varado, por lo que se
                                    volvió á éch ar fuera, y se le envió para auxîliarla. Habia
                                    tenido aquella goleta la desgracia de venirsele el anclote, que
                                    habia dado con la espía, y se hallaba muy expuesta á dar un

                                    para evitar este desastre. A la Sutil tambien se le vino el
                                    ancla en el instante de dar la vela, y por pronto que se acudió
                                    con el aparejo, varó en seis pies escasos de agua; pero tomadas
                                    las debidas providencias, al cabo de una hora saliéron las dos á

                                <cell>The commander immediately ordered soundings at the stern and
                                    the quarters; at two cables distance two fathoms were found, and
                                    it was ascertained that the anchor had fallen in three. This
                                    mistake of the steersman placed us in a very awkward situation.
                                    The night was passed with anxiety, and during the whole of it
                                    the water decreased, so that at daybreak we were in a fathom and
                                    a half. We had seen illuminations to the S.E. of the mountain of
                                    Carmelo, and even some flashes at times, indications which left
                                    no doubt that there are volcanoes with strong eruptions in those
                                    parts. The Mexicana had anchored about two cables more to the
                                    W., and in half a fathom less water; the wind, which had blown
                                    pretty freshly in the night from S.S.E., had raised a swell,
                                    with which it began to touch at the stern. She immediately gave
                                    out a warp with her launch, and upon that set about hoisting
                                    sail without loosing the rope until meeting the wind. Meanwhile
                                    the Sutil was shortening in her cable, and was found to be in
                                    two fathoms water; we were hoisting in the boat in order to set
                                    sail, when we noticed that the Mexicana had grounded; it was,
                                    therefore, got out again and sent to her assistance. That
                                    schooner had had the misfortune to drag home the stream anchor,
                                    which she had cast with the warp, and was in great danger of
                                    going over, so that it was necessary for the men to prop her
                                    with the oars to prevent such a disaster. The Sutil also dragged
                                    home her anchor at the moment of setting sail, and quickly as
                                    the tackle was resorted to she grounded in a scanty six feet of
                                    water; but, all due means having been applied, at the end of an
                                    hour both vessels were afloat.</cell>

                                    Bay of Gaston at 4 in the afternoon, and made for the Channel of
                                    Pacheco; they proceeded by mid-channel, the wind somewhat
                                    abating, and taking the direction of the channel itself as soon
                                    as they entered it. After leaving the channel, in the Creek of
                                    Lara, we saw two smaller boats, one with sliding sail-rigging,
                                    the other with square sail, which were following the coast
                                    toward the N. We had no doubt that they belonged to the two
                                    English vessels which were in the Strait, according to the
                                    information of our friend Tetacus. We went on without changing
                                    course, thinking to navigate all night with little sail and to
                                    be off the Point of San Rafael at daybreak, so as to get to the
                                    mouth of Floridablanca early in the morning, to go within and to
                                    make the survey at once, which, as has been said, we had reason
                                    to believe would be very interesting. From 10 to 12 at night we
                                    crossed the Creek del Garzon, and saw lights within it which
                                    indicated that the vessels to which the smaller boats belonged
                                    were in that anchorage.</cell>

                                    distance to near the Point of San Rafael by 1 o’clock. We stood
                                    outward with reefed topsails; and at 2 in the morning we veered
                                    inward, sounding soon in seven fathoms deep; we again stood
                                    outward, and the depth continued decreasing to five fathoms
                                    sand. In this situation it appeared fitting to cast anchor, so
                                    as not to run any risk in seeking the outlet at night, and as it
                                    was not prudent to continue near the mouth without having more

                                        este puerto en nombre de Su Magestad, recordó que en 1774,
                                        de vuelta de su expedicion al Norte, le habia parecido ver
                                        una entrada muy ancha por los 48° 20′ de latitud. Creyendo
                                        que pudiese ser la de Fuca, commisionó un segundo piloto
                                        mandando la goleta Gertrudis para que se cerciorase de si
                                        exista ó no dicha entrada; en efecto el piloto volvió

                                        the Creek pilot John de Fuca, of the channel which bears his
                                        name, was the only one we had up to the year 1789.
                                        Sub-lieutenant (Alférez de Navío) Don Esteban Martinez,
                                        being at Nootka, after having taken possession of that port
                                        in the name of Her Majesty, stated that, in 1774, in
                                        returning from his expedition to the north, he thought he
                                        saw a very wide entrance at 48° 20′ latitude. Believing that
                                        it might be that of Fuca, he directed a second mate (piloto)
                                        in command of the schooner Gertrudis to ascertain whether
                                        that entrance existed or not. The mate returned, saying that
                                        he had found it to be twenty-one miles wide, and its center
                                        in 48° 30′ latitude, 19° 28′ west of San Blas.</cell>

                                        Lieutenant Don Francisco Eliza received orders in the year
                                        1790 to have a minute survey made of that entrance. He
                                        appointed Sub - lieutenant Don Manuel Quimper, who commanded
                                        the sloop Princesa Real, for that purpose. The said officer
                                        sailed from the port of Nootka on the 31st of May, examined
                                        the port of Claucaud, afterwards penetrated the channel of

                                        of them, and retired on the 1st of August, the weather not

                                        que causaba la curiosidad de los geógrafos. Dicho oficial

                                    <cell>In the following year Eliza received orders from the
                                        viceroy of New Spain to complete the examination already
                                        begun, and which excited the curiosity of geographers. That
                                        officer left Nootka in command of the packet San Carlos and
                                        the schooner Horcasitas, intending to go up to 60° latitude,
                                        and to come down and examine the coast to the channel of
                                        Fuca, then to enter therein to examine it completely; but
                                        the wind not allowing him for many days to get to the north,
                                        he determined to begin his examinations at 48°, and entered
                                        the channel on the 27th of May. He remained in it till the
                                        7th of August, when he found himself obliged to retire
                                        because part of his crew had the scurvy, and he had not the
                                        necessary diet for them. During this time he caused plans to
                                        be made of some of the ports, and had part of the coast
                                        examined by the mate, Don Joseph Narvaez, being unable to do
                                        it himself because he had fallen sick.</cell>

                                        said: “Assuring your excellency that the passage to the

                            <p>1. About 1845–’46, had the Hudson’s Bay Company any fort or
                                settlement on the Fraser River?</p>
                            <p>2. How did trading-vessels or other craft communicate with that fort
                                or settlement from foreign parts, and from other settlements on the
                                Columbia River, or its neighborhood?</p>
                            <p>3. The date of the settlement of Fort Langley on Fraser River?</p>
                            <p>4. About the time of the negotiation of the Treaty of June, 1846,
                                what was the common opinion of Great Britain insisting on the 49th
                                parallel being deflected in a southerly direction through the
                                Straits of Fuca to the Pacific, instead of cutting through
                                Vancouver’s Island?</p>
                            <p>5. If to secure access to the possessions to the northward of 49°
                                parallel, state what possessions Great Britain held to the northward
                                of 49°, and where.</p>
                            <p>6. If the free navigation of the straits and adjacent channel was not
                                guaranteed to Great Britain, how could access be obtained to those
                                possessions north of 49°?</p>
                            <p>7. When the Treaty was signed in June, 1846, and previous to that
                                date, which channel was known and used by vessels amongst the
                                islands forming the archipelagos between Vancouver’s Island and the
                                continent, to get access to our dominions north of 49°?</p>
                            <p>8. Forward proofs and affidavits, legally attested by captains of
                                vessels, and others, who made use of the channel then known, and
                                their reasons for making use of it.</p>
                            <p>9. Previous to the signing of the Treaty in 1846, and also at that
                                time, how many channels were known to be navigable amongst the
                                islands forming the archipelago between Vancouver’s Island and the
                                continent of America?</p>
                            <p>And I, Henry Slye Mason, above named, solemnly declare, that I make
                                the above statements, conscientiously believing the same to be true;

                                time of making his declaration, and therein referred to on the 29th

                            <p>Before me:</p>
                            <p>M. W. TYRWHITT DRAKE, <hi rend="italic">Notary Public.</hi></p>
                            <p rend="center">A.</p>
                            <p>I, William Henry McNeill, of Gonzala Bay, Vancouver Island, in the
                                Province of British Columbia, Dominion of Canada, now a settler, do
                                solemnly and sincerely declare as follows:</p>
                            <pb n="101" xml:id="pg_101" facs="0127"/>
                            <p>I am sixty-eight years of age, and at twenty years of age I became a
                                master mariner.</p>
                            <p>I have been on the Northwest Pacific coast since 1832, and have been
                                employed as a master mariner during the greater part of that time
                                till 1863 on the said coast.</p>
                            <p>From 1832 till 1837 I was employed by the Hudson’s Bay Company, in
                                the command of the ship Llama, which during that period plied
                                between Columbia River and Fort Simpson, British Columbia, 54° north
                                latitude.</p>
                            <p>On two occasions during that period, in going through the Straits of
                                Fuca to Fraser River, and returning from Fraser to Columbia River, I
                                passed through Rosario Straits. My reason for not passing through
                                Haro Straits was that there was then no known or surveyed channel
                                through Haro Straits; on the other occasions I went to the westward
                                of Vancouver Island. During the whole of this period I never heard
                                of a vessel passing through Haro Straits, and Rosario Straits was
                                the only channel known and surveyed, and I was in constant
                                communication during such period with sea-faring men who traversed
                                the waters between Vancouver Island and the main-land. In 1837, and
                                from thence till 1843, I commanded the steamer Beaver, belonging to
                                the Hudson’s Bay Company, and she was employed during that time in
                                trading between Fort Simpson aforesaid, Fraser River, and
                                Nisqually-Puget Sound. During all that time, between 1837 and 1843,
                                I never heard of a vessel going through Haro Straits, and I was
                                during that period, from 1837 till 1843, in constant communication
                                with ship-masters trading on the said waters.</p>
                            <p>In 1843 I went to England, and continued absent from this Northwest
                                Pacific coast for twelve months, and returning in 1844, I was still
                                in the Hudson’s Bay Company’s service at Stekin, Fort Rupert, and
                                Fort Simpson on the said Northwest Pacific coast, and from thence
                                till 1846 I never heard of any vessel going through Haro Straits,
                                with the exception of the steamer Beaver, in 1846. Till then she
                                always went through Rosario Straits on her usual voyages in the
                                Hudson’s Bay Company’s employ, the only then known channel.</p>
                            <p>During all this time till 1846, I never heard of Haro Straits being
                                used by vessels, and I was in constant communication with
                                ship-masters trading in the waters between Vancouver Island and the
                                *main-land, and the Northwest Pacific coast. And since 1846 Rosario
                                Straits has still been the most usual channel for sailing
                                    vessels.<seg type="margin">[49]</seg></p>
                            <p>In navigating these waters between Vancouver Island and the
                                main-land, I always used Vancouver’s charts, and heard of no others
                                till the chart made in pursuance of the survey of Captain Richards
                                and his officers, with the exception of the old Spanish chart, which
                                was of little value.</p>
                            <p>The first chart which I knew of as laying down a survey of Haro
                                Straits, was Captain Richards’ chart.</p>
                            <p>I further say that Vancouver Island was generally supposed to be
                                united with what is now named Galiano Island on Richards’ chart till
                                after Captain Richards’ survey.</p>
                            <p>In Rosario Straits the currents and tides are comparatively regular,
                                but in Haro Straits, and round the islands adjacent to Vancouver
                                Island, and in the waters about Vancouver Island itself, the tides
                                and currents are always very irregular.</p>
                            <p>Referring to the questions submitted to me relative to the boundary
                                    <pb n="102" xml:id="pg_102" facs="0128"/>line referred to in the
                                treaty of Oregon, in answer to the first question I declare, as
                                aforesaid:</p>
                            <p>1. That about 1845 and 1846 the Hudson’s Bay Company had a settlement
                                at Langley, on the Fraser River, and the said settlement existed
                                since 1827 or 1828, to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>
                            <p>2. In answer to the second question, I declare, as aforesaid, that
                                trading-vessels or other craft communicated with the settlement of
                                Langley from foreign parts, and from the settlements on the Columbia
                                River or its neighborhood, by the Straits of Rosario and the Gulf of
                                Georgia.</p>
                            <p>3. In answer to the third question, I declare, as aforesaid, that, to
                                the best of my knowledge, information, or belief, Langley, on the
                                Fraser River, was settled about the year 1827 or 1828.</p>
                            <p>4. In answer to the fourth question, I declare, as aforesaid, that,
                                about the time of the negotiation of the Treaty of June, 1846, the
                                common opinion as to the object of Great Britain insisting on the
                                forty-ninth parallel being deflected in a southerly direction, and
                                through the Straits of Fuca to the Pacific, instead of cutting
                                through Vancouver Island, was that it was to secure access to her
                                possessions to the northward of the forty-ninth parallel through the
                                Straits of Fuca.</p>
                            <p>5. In answer to the fifth question, I declare, as aforesaid, that
                                Great Britain then held British Columbia, up to the parallel of
                                north latitude 54° 40′ and Vancouver Island.</p>
                            <p>6. In answer to the sixth question, I declare, as aforesaid, that, if
                                the free navigation of the straits and adjacent channel was not
                                guaranteed to Great Britain, access could only be secured and
                                obtained to those possessions by ships going to the westward of
                                Vancouver Island. And as regards those possessions on the coast of
                                British Columbia between the fifty-first and forty-ninth parallel,
                                access would have to be sought through a strait which is intricate
                                and difficult of navigation, by reason of the strength of the tides,
                                and almost impracticable for sailing-vessels.</p>
                            <p>7 and 8. In answer to the seventh and eighth questions, I declare, as
                                aforesaid, that, when the treaty was signed in June, 1846, and
                                previous to that date, the channel which was known and used by
                                vessels amongst the islands forming the archipelago between
                                Vancouver Island and the continent to get access to the dominions of
                                Great Britain north of the forty-ninth parallel, was the Strait of
                                Rosario, and that channel only, as it was then the only surveyed
                                channel.</p>
                            <p>9. In answer to the ninth question, I declare, as aforesaid, that,
                                previous to the signing of the Treaty in A. D. 1846, and also at
                                that time, the only channel known to be navigable amongst the
                                islands forming the archipelago between Vancouver Island and the
                                continent, was the Strait of Rosario.</p>
                            <p>And I declare, as aforesaid, that, even since Haro Straits has been
                                fully surveyed, I consider Rosario Strait as a much safer channel
                                for a sailing-ship, in passing either from the Straits of Fuca to
                                the Gulf of Georgia, or for a sailing-ship passing from the Gulf of
                                Georgia to the Straits of Fuca, inasmuch as the Rosario Strait has
                                good anchorage throughout its entire length, and has more regular
                                tides than Haro Straits. The anchorage in Haro Strait is bad, on
                                account of the great depth of its waters, and the irregularity and
                                strength of its tides. The navigation of Haro Strait, moreover, is
                                much impeded by numerous small islands and rocks.</p>
                            <p>During all the time between A. D. 1837 and the year A. D. 1843, I was
                                in command, as aforesaid, of the Hudson’s Bay Company’s steamer
                                Beaver, and I was in the habit of taking the said steamer once or
                                twice <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103" facs="0129"/>every year during
                                that period from Fort Simpson to Langley on the Fraser River, and
                                from thence to Nisqually-Puget Sound; and from Nisqually back again
                                to Langley and Fort Simpson, and on those occasions I always passed

                                between Fuca Strait and the Gulf of Georgia.</p>
                            <p>And I, William Henry McNeill, above named, solemnly declare that the
                                questions hereinbefore referred to, are contained in the paper

                            <p>I, William Mitchell, of Victoria, Vancouver Island, in the Province
                                of British Columbia, Dominion of Canada, master mariner, do solemnly
                                and sincerely declare and state as follows:</p>
                            <p>I am sixty-eight years of age. I became a master mariner in 1851, and
                                have been on the Northwest Pacific coast since 1837, and have been
                                employed all the time in the Hudson’s Bay Company’s ships. From 1837
                                to 1846 I was constantly employed in passages from Victoria to
                                Fraser River, and back again; from Columbia River to Fraser River,
                                and back again; and from Nisqually-Puget Sound to Fraser River, and
                                back again; and trading generally between those ports as well as
                                sometimes to Honolulu and Sitka, and other between ports on the
                                Northwest Pacific coast, And whenever the vessel I was in had
                                occasion to go from the Straits of Fuca to the Gulf of Georgia, or
                                back from the Gulf of Georgia to the Straits of Fuca, she always
                                passed through Rosario Straits as the only then known navigable
                                channel.</p>
                            <p>As late as the year 1855 I had occasion to pilot a vessel from
                                Victoria to Nisqually, and from Nisqually to Nanaimo, and from
                                Nanaimo to Victoria, and both in going to Nanaimo and returning
                                therefrom made use of Rosario Strait as the best known channel.</p>
                            <p>Previous to 1846 there was only one channel known to be navigable,
                                and that was the Rosario Straits.</p>
                            <p>In the year 1846, to the best of my knowledge, information, and
                                belief, no chart of Haro Strait soundings existed.</p>
                            <p>The chart in use was that of Rosario Strait only, and from soundings
                                made by Vancouver.</p>
                            <p>Referring to the questions submitted to me relative to the boundary
                                line referred to in the Treaty of Oregon, in answer to the first
                                question I declare, as aforesaid:</p>
                            <p>1. That about 1845 and 1846 the Hudson’s Bay Company had a settlement
                                at Langley, on the Fraser River, and the said settlement existed
                                since 1827 or 1828.</p>
                            <p>2. In answer to the second question, I declare, as aforesaid, that
                                trading-vessels or other craft communicated with the settlement of
                                Langley from foreign parts, and from the settlements on the Columbia
                                River, or its neighborhood, by the Straits of Rosario and the Gulf
                                of Georgia.</p>
                            <p>3. In answer to the third question, I declare, as aforesaid, that, to
                                the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, Langley, on the
                                Fraser River, was settled about the year 1827 or 1828.</p>
                            <p>4. In answer to the fourth question, I declare, as aforesaid, that
                                about the time of the negotiation of the Treaty of June, 1846, the
                                common opinion as to the object of Great Britain insisting on the
                                forty-ninth parallel being deflected in a southerly direction, and
                                through the Straits of Fuca to the Pacific, instead of cutting
                                through Vancouver Island, was, that it was to secure access to her
                                possessions to the northward of the forty-ninth parallel through the
                                Straits of Fuca.</p>
                            <p>5. In answer to the fifth question, I declare, as aforesaid, that
                                Great <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105" facs="0131"/>Britain then held
                                British Columbia up to parallel of north latitude 55° 40′ and
                                Vancouver Island.</p>
                            <p>6. In answer to the sixth question, I declare, as aforesaid, that if
                                the free navigation of the straits and adjacent channel was not
                                guaranteed to Great Britain, access could only be secured and
                                obtained to those possessions by ships going to the westward of
                                Vancouver Island; and as regards those possessions on the coast of
                                British Columbia, between the fifty-first and forty-ninth parallel,
                                access would have to be *sought through a strait which is intricate
                                and difficult of navigation by reason of the strength of the
                                    tides.<seg type="margin">[51]</seg></p>
                            <p>7 and 8. In answer to the seventh and eighth questions, I declare, as
                                aforesaid, that when the treaty was signed in June, 1846, and
                                previous to that date, the channel which was known and used by
                                vessels among the islands forming the Archipelago, between
                                Vancouver’s Island and the continent, to get access to the dominions
                                of Great Britain north of the forty-ninth parallel, was the Strait
                                of Rosario and that channel only, as it was then the only surveyed
                                channel.</p>
                            <p>9. In answer to the ninth question, I declare, as aforesaid, that
                                previous to the signing of the Treaty in 1846, and also at that
                                time, the only channel known to be navigable among the islands
                                forming the Archipelago between Vancouver Island and the continent
                                was the Rosario Strait.</p>
                            <p>And I further say that, even since Haro Strait has been fully
                                surveyed, I consider Rosario Strait a much safer channel for a
                                sailing-ship in passing either from the Straits of Fuca to the Gulf
                                of Georgia, or for a sailing-ship passing from the Gulf of Georgia
                                to the Straits of Fuca, inasmuch as Rosario Strait has good
                                anchorage throughout its entire length, and has more regular tides
                                than Haro Straits. The anchorage in Haro Strait is bad on account of
                                the great depth of its waters and the irregularity and strength of
                                its tides. The navigation of Haro Strait, moreover, is much impeded
                                by numerous small islands and rocks.</p>
                            <p>In the beginning of the year A. D. 1839, I recollect making a voyage,
                                as first mate, from Columbia River to Fraser River, and thence back
                                to the Columbia River in the bark Vancouver, and on these occasions
                                she passed and repassed through Rosario Straits.</p>
                            <p>In A. D. 1840, I made two voyages in the schooner Cadboro, from
                                Columbia River to Fraser River, and returned to the Columbia River
                                in the Cadboro, and passed and repassed through Rosario Straits on
                                these voyages.</p>
                            <p>In A. D. 1842, I made a voyage from Columbia River to Fraser River in
                                the Cadboro, as first mate, and returned from Fraser River to the
                                Columbia River, and on these occasions I passed and repassed through
                                Rosario Strait. And between A. D. 1842 and 1846, I made several voy
                                ages in the schooner Cadboro, as first mate, from Columbia River and
                                Victoria to Nisqually and Langley on the Fraser River, and thence
                                returned to Victoria and Columbia River, and on such occasions I
                                always passed and repassed through Rosario Strait, as it was the
                                only then known channel.</p>
                            <p>And I, William Mitchell, above named, solemnly declare that the
                                questions hereinbefore referred to are contained in the paper
                                writing marked Z, produced and shown to me at the time of making
                                this declaration; and that I make the above statements
                                conscientiously, believing the same to be true; and by virtue of the
                                provisions of an act made and passed in the sixth year of the reign
                                of His Majesty King William the Fourth, intituled “An act to repeal

                                for the abolition of unnecessary oaths.’”</p>

                            <p>M. W. TYRWHITT DRAKE, <hi rend="italic">Notary Public.</hi></p>
                            <p rend="center">C.</p>
                            <p>I, John Swanson, of Victoria, Vancouver Island, in the Province of
                                British Columbia, Dominion of Canada, master mariner, do solemnly
                                and sincerely declare as follows:</p>
                            <pb n="107" xml:id="pg_107" facs="0133"/>
                            <p>I have been a master mariner since the year 1855, and have been in
                                the employment of the Hudson’s Bay Company on their ships trading on
                                the Northwest Pacific coast, since the year 1842 to the present
                                time, as a nautical man and mariner.</p>
                            <p>Referring to the questions submitted to me relative to the boundary
                                line referred to in the Treaty of Oregon, in answer to the first
                                question I declare, as aforesaid:</p>
                            <p>1. That, about 1845 and 1846, the Hudson’s Bay Company had a
                                settlement at Langley, on the Fraser River, and the said settlement
                                existed since 1827 or 1828.</p>
                            <p>2. In answer to the second question, I declare, as aforesaid, that up
                                to 1845 and 1846, Hudson’s Bay Company’s ships, bound from Honolulu,
                                in the Sandwich Islands; from Fort Vancouver, on the Columbia River;
                                and San Francisco and Sitka, to Langley, passed through Fuca Straits
                                and Rosario Strait. Also vessels trading between Fort Nisqually and
                                Langley used to pass through Rosario Strait. Also vessels trading
                                between Victoria and Langley used to pass through Rosario
                                Strait.</p>
                            <p>3. In answer to the third question, I declare, as aforesaid, that to
                                the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, Langley, on the
                                Fraser River, was settled about the year 1827 or 1828.</p>
                            <p>4. In answer to the fourth question, I declare, as aforesaid, that
                                about the time of the negotiation of the Treaty of June, 1846, the
                                common opinion as to the object of Great Britain insisting on the
                                forty-ninth parallel being deflected in a southerly direction, and
                                through the Straits of Fuca to the Pacific, instead of cutting
                                through Vancouver Island, was, that it was to secure access to her
                                possessions to the northward of the forty-ninth parallel, through
                                the Straits of Fuca.</p>
                            <p>5. In answer to the fifth question, I declare, as aforesaid, that
                                Great Britain then held British Columbia up to parallel of north
                                latitude 54° 40′, and Vancouver Island.</p>
                            <p>6. In answer to the sixth question, I declare, as aforesaid, that if
                                the free navigation of the straits and adjacent channel was not
                                guaranteed to Great Britain, access could only be secured and
                                obtained to those possessions by ships going to the westward of
                                Vancouver Island; and, as regards those possessions on the coast of
                                British Columbia between the fifty-first and forty-ninth parallel,
                                access would have to be sought through a strait which is intricate
                                and difficult of navigation by reason of the strength of the
                                tides.</p>
                            <p>7 and 8. In answer to the seventh and eighth questions, I declare, as
                                aforesaid, that when the treaty was signed in June, 1846, and
                                previous to that date, the channel which was known and used by
                                vessels amongst the islands forming the Archipelago between
                                Vancouver Island and the continent, to get access to the dominions
                                of Great Britain, north of the forty-ninth parallel, was the Strait
                                of Rosario, and that channel only; and it was then the only surveyed
                                channel.</p>
                            <p>9. In answer to the ninth question, I declare, as aforesaid, that
                                previous to the signing of the treaty in 1846, and also at that
                                time, the only channel known to be navigable amongst the islands
                                forming the Archipelago between Vancouver’s Island and the continent
                                was the Strait of Rosario.</p>
                            <p>And I further declare, as aforesaid, that in the end of the year 1842
                                or beginning of 1843, I sailed from Vancouver, on the Columbia
                                River, to Nisqually, on Puget Sound, and the vessel I was in was
                                thence towed through Rosario Straits by the Hudson’s Bay Company’s
                                steamer Beaver, and thence sailed through Gulf of Georgia and
                                Johnston Strait <pb n="108" xml:id="pg_108" facs="0134"/>to Sitka,
                                and returned therefrom through Johnston Strait and Rosario Strait to
                                Victoria.</p>
                            <p>During the years 1843 and 1844 I made several trips in the schooner
                                Cadboro, from Victoria to Langley, through Rosario Strait, and back
                                again from Langley to Victoria through Rosario Strait. I was
                                occupied generally in making such voyages during those two years,
                                and we always passed and repassed through Rosario Straits.</p>
                            <p>To the best of my recollection, in 1845 I made a voyage in the bark
                                Vancouver, from the Columbia River to Fort Langley, through Rosario
                                Strait, and back again to Victoria.</p>
                            <p>In the year 1846, to the best of my knowledge, information, and
                                belief, no chart of Haro Strait soundings existed. The chart in use
                                was that of Rosario Strait only, and from surveys made by
                                Vancouver.</p>
                            <p>Previous to 1846, to the best of my knowledge, information, and
                                belief, no sailing-vessel, except on the occasion of the Cadboro,
                                went through Haro Strait under sail. If other sailing-vessels had,
                                previous to 1846, passed through Haro Strait, I, as a sea-faring man
                                on the northwest Pacific coast, should, in all probability, have
                                heard of it.</p>
                            <p>The one occasion on which the Cadboro passed through Haro Strait was
                                in 1843, and she then was carried by the tide in a calm, on her
                                passage from Langley to Victoria, into Haro Straits, and we were
                                then obliged to avail ourselves of the services of an Indian we met
                                with as a pilot, as we had no chart by which to navigate.</p>
                            <p>And I, John Swanson above named, solemnly declare that the questions
                                hereinbefore referred to are contained in the paper writing marked
                                Z, shown to me at the time of making this declaration, and that I
                                make the above statements conscientiously, believing the same to be
                                true; and by virtue of the provisions of an act made and passed in
                                the sixth year of the reign of His Majesty King William the Fourth,
                                intituled “An act to repeal an act of the present session of
                                Parliament, intituled ‘An act for the more effectual abolition of
                                oaths and affirmations taken and made in various departments of the

                            <p>This is the paper writing marked D, shown to Henry Slye Mason at the
                                time of his making his declaration, and therein referred to on the
                                29th day of September, 1871.</p>
                            <p>Before me:</p>
                            <p>M. W. TYRWHITT DRAKE, <hi rend="italic">Notary Public.</hi></p>
                            <p rend="center">D.</p>
                            <p>I, Alexander Caulfield Anderson, now of Saanich, Vancouver Island, in
                                the Province of British Columbia, Dominion of Canada, settler, do
                                solemnly and sincerely declare as follows:</p>
                            <p>I am an ex-chief trader, of the Hudson’s Bay Company, and late an
                                agent of Lloyd’s for the Columbia River and the adjacent coasts, and
                                from 1833 and 1851 I was under the several appointments held by me
                                as an officer of the Hudson’s Bay Company, connected (with the
                                exception of short intervals) directly or indirectly with the
                                business of the said company on the Northwest Pacific coast, which
                                business then required their vessels frequently to navigate the
                                waters of the gulf, and the Archipelago, and Straits of Fuca, and
                                during the greater portion of the said period, resided on, or was in
                                constant communication with the Northwest Pacific coast.</p>
                            <p>1. In answer to the first question, I declare, as aforesaid, that
                                about 1845 and 1846, the Hudson’s Bay Company had a settlement at
                                Langley on the Fraser River, and other settlements higher up the
                                river.</p>
                            <p>2. In answer to the second question, I declare, as aforesaid, that
                                trading-vessels or other craft communicated with the settlement of
                                Langley from foreign parts, and from the settlements of the Columbia
                                River or its neighborhood, by the Straits of Fuca, the Straits of
                                Rosario, and the Gulf of Georgia.</p>
                            <p>3. In answer to the third question, I declare, as aforesaid, that, to
                                the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, Langley, on the
                                Fraser River, was settled about the year 1827 or 1828.</p>
                            <p>4. In answer to the fourth question, I declare, as aforesaid, that
                                about the time of the negotiation of the Treaty of June, 1846, the
                                common opinion as to the object of Great Britain insisting on the
                                forty ninth parallel being deflected in a southerly direction,
                                through the Straits of <pb n="110" xml:id="pg_110" facs="0136"/>Fuca
                                to the Pacific, instead of cutting through Vancouver Island, was to
                                secure access to her possessions to the northward of the forty-ninth
                                parallel.</p>
                            <p>5. In answer to the fifth question, I declare, as aforesaid, that
                                Great Britain then held British Columbia up to parallel of north
                                latitude 54° 40′, and Vancouver Island.</p>
                            <p>6. In answer to the sixth question, I declare, as aforesaid, that if
                                the free navigation of the straits and adjacent channel was not
                                guaranteed to Great Britain, access could only be obtained to those
                                possessions by ships going to the westward of Vancouver Island; and
                                as regards those possessions on *the coast of British Columbia,
                                between the fifty-first and forty-ninth parallel, access would have
                                to be sought through a strait which is intricate and difficult of
                                navigation by reason of the strength of the tides.<seg type="margin"
                                    >[54]</seg></p>
                            <p>7 and 8. In answer to the seventh and eighth questions, I declare, as
                                aforesaid, that when the Treaty was signed in June, 1846, and
                                previous to that date, the channel which was known and used by
                                vessels amongst the islands forming the Archipelago between
                                Vancouver Island and the continent, to get access to our dominions
                                north of the forty-ninth parallel, was the Straits of Rosario, and
                                that channel only, as it was then the only surveyed channel.</p>
                            <p>9. In answer to the ninth question, I declare, as aforesaid, that
                                previous to the signing of the Treaty in 1846, and also at that
                                time, the only channel known to be navigable amongst the islands
                                forming the Archipelago between Vancouver Island and the continent
                                of America was the Straits of Rosario.</p>
                            <p>I further declare, as aforesaid, the whole tenor of my experience
                                during my said residence on or near the Northwest Pacific coast, was
                                to the effect that the only recognized channel of approach to Fraser
                                River, or to the northern parts by the inner passage through the
                                Gulf of Georgia, was by the Straits of Rosario.</p>
                            <p>I further declare, as aforesaid, that in the winter of 1834, while on
                                my way from Fort Simpson to the Columbia River, on board the
                                Hudson’s Bay Company’s brig Dryad, Captain Kipling, we had orders to
                                touch at Fort Langley on Fraser River. The track indicated to me
                                upon Vancouver’s chart by the master, and which we purposed to
                                follow, was by the Rosario Strait, the usual and only known channel
                                at that time. Stress of weather and the failure of provisions
                                compelled us to bear up for the Columbia, after endeavoring to enter
                                the Straits of Fuca without having fulfilled our object of
                                proceeding to Langley.</p>
                            <p>In 1841, while I was in charge of the Hudson’s Bay Company’s
                                establishment at Fort Nisqually, on Puget Sound, the United States
                                Exploring Expedition, under Commodore Wilkes, arrived there.
                                Commodore Wilkes was desirous of detaching a surveying-vessel (the
                                Porpoise, Commander Ringgold) towards Fraser River, and on his
                                application for a pilot, one of the crew of the Hudson Bay Company’s
                                steamer Beaver was sent on board. This pilot (whose name I think was
                                Wade) was acquainted only with the Rosario Channel.</p>
                            <p>In June, or early in July, 1848, having conducted for the first time
                                the brigade with the returns from the interior to Fort Langley on
                                Fraser River, I traveled by canoe from that station to Victoria on
                                Vancouver Island. Crossing the Gulf of Georgia, we passed through
                                what has since been known as Plumper, or Active Pass, and then by
                                the Strait of Haro. This was at that time known as the canoe-route,
                                as distinguished from the established ship-route by the Rosario
                                Strait.</p>
                            <p>In July, 1850, the schooner Cadboro, Captain Scarborough, arrived
                                    at<pb n="111" xml:id="pg_111" facs="0137"/>Langley during my
                                visit there from the interior, bringing supplies for the trade. The
                                following year another vessel belonging to the company (the
                                Recovery, I think) came to the mouth of Fraser River to receive our
                                furs. In neither case did I hear any mention of the Haro Channel, or
                                that any deviation from the old established track had occurred.</p>
                            <p>That as late as 1851, I may distinctly state my conviction, from
                                personal knowledge of facts, that the Rosario Strait was the only
                                authorized channel of communication followed by the vessels of the
                                Hudson’s Bay Company. I have heard, indeed, that an experimental
                                trip through the Haro Strait had, on one occasion, been made with
                                the steamer Beaver, under Captain Brotchie, at that time master, but
                                I understood likewise that the master was reprimanded on this
                                occasion for his temerity. Whatever the partial explorations that
                                had been made at an earlier period by the Spaniards, and afterwards
                                by Commander Ringgold, of the United States Navy, the passage was
                                incompletely known; and it was only after the survey performed under
                                the direction of the present hydrographer of the Admiralty, Admiral
                                Richards, in Her Majesty’s ship Plumper, that the capacity of the
                                Haro Strait as a channel of communication, superseding to some
                                extent the original route by the Rosario Strait, was publicly
                                recognized.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, I distinctly state that, up to the winter of 1852–’53,
                                when we were surprised by the adverse position then suddenly
                                advanced, no doubt was entertained by me, or any one that I know of
                                in this quarter, acquainted with the facts, as to that
                                interpretation of the Treaty which refers the water-line to the only
                                ship-channel then known, the Rosario Strait.</p>
                            <p>And I, the above-named Alexander Caulfield Anderson, solemnly declare
                                that I make the above statements conscientiously, believing the same
                                to be true, and by virtue of the provisions of an act made and
                                passed in the sixth year of the reign of His Majesty King William
                                IV, intituled “An act to repeal an act of the present session of
                                Parliament, intituled an act for the more effectual abolition of

                                more entire suppression of voluntary and extra-judicial oaths and
                                affidavits, and to make other provisions for the abolition of
                                unnecessary oaths.”</p>

                            <p>This is the paper writing marked E, shown to Henry Slye Mason at the
                                time of his making his declaration, and therein referred to on the
                                29th day of September, 1871.</p>
                            <p>Before me:</p>
                            <p>M. W. TYRWHITT DRAKE, <hi rend="italic">Notary Public.</hi></p>
                            <p rend="center">E.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Herbert G. Lewis</hi>.</p>
                            <p>My name is Herbert G. Lewis, master mariner. I have been a master
                                mariner since 1859. I came to this coast in 1847. I have been in the
                                Hudson Bay Company’s service from that time till now, and during the
                                greater part of that time I have been trading on the North Pacific
                                coast, in charge of that company’s vessels.</p>
                            <p>2. In answer to question 2, I say: To the best of my knowledge,
                                information, and belief, the only channel used by sailing-vessels
                                going to Fort Langley on the Fraser River, through the Straits of
                                Fuca, was the Rosario Straits, in the year 1848–’49.</p>
                            <p>4. In answer to question 4, I say: In the latter part of 1847 and in
                                1848 it was considered that the object was to give free access to
                                British territory on the Northwest Pacific coast, up to the
                                fifty-second parallel of latitude.</p>
                            <p>5. In answer to question 5, I say: She held Vancouver Island and she
                                held British Columbia up to 54° 40′ north latitude.</p>
                            <pb n="113" xml:id="pg_113" facs="0139"/>
                            <p>6. In answer to question 6, I say: Only by going to the westward of
                                Vanconver Island.</p>
                            <p>7. In answer to question 7, I say: I can only speak to the period
                                after 1847, and to the best of my knowledge, information, and
                                belief, from thence to 1848 and 1849 the Haro Straits were not used
                                by sailing-vessels; if they had been so used, I, as a sea-faring man
                                on the Northwest Pacific coast, should have heard of it.</p>
                            <p>8. In answer to question 8, I say: The reason for Haro Straits not
                                being used by sailing-ships in 1847, 1848, and 1849, was that it was
                                then unsurveyed.</p>
                            <p>9. In answer to question 9, I say: As I before said, in 1847, 1848,
                                and 1849, Rosario Strait was used as a surveyed channel, and Haro
                                Straits had not been surveyed, and was not so used by ships.</p>
                            <p>Vancouver’s charts were used for these waters in 1847, and till 1854.
                                I never knew the Spanish chart used, or any American chart used,
                                about that time. To the best of my knowledge I never heard of a
                                vessel going through Haro Straits, but only through Rosario Straits
                                in 1847, 1848, and 1849.</p>
                            <p>The map A, especially as regards Haro Straits, is a most inaccurate
                                representation of what was nautically known in 1847, 1848, and 1849;
                                Haro Straits being then unknown, and Rosario Straits generally used
                                by ships.</p>
                            <p>From 1847 till 1852 I was employed on board ships of the said
                                company, trading between Honolulu and Victoria for the Hudson’s Bay
                                Company, and Haro Straits have been from time to time navigated
                                since 1852 by me.</p>
                            <p>Tides are very irregular on the east coast of Vancouver Island. This
                                irregularity could hardly exist if Haro Strait was the channel
                                through which the main volume of water ebbed and flowed.</p>
                            <p>Off East Point and Patos Island a current with the ebb and flood tide
                                sets so strong as to render that part of Haro Straits unsafe for
                                sailingvessels.</p>
                            <p>And I, Herbert G. Lewis, above named, solemnly declare that I make
                                the above statements conscientiously, believing the same to be true,
                                and by virtue of the provisions of an act made and passed in the
                                sixth year of the reign of His Majesty King William IV, intituled
                                “An act to repeal an act of the present session of Parliament,

                                affidavits, and to make other provisions for the abolition of

                            </p>
                            <p>1. About 1845–’46, had the Hudson’s Bay Company any fort or
                                settlement on the Fraser River?</p>
                            <p>2. How did trading-vessels or other craft communicate with that fort
                                or settlement from foreign parts, and from other settlements on the
                                Columbia River or its neighborhood?</p>
                            <p>3. The date of the settlement of Fort Langley on Fraser River?</p>
                            <p>4. About the time of the negotiation of the Treaty of June, 1846,
                                what was the common opinion of Great Britain insisting on the
                                forty-ninth parallel being deflected in a southerly direction,
                                through the Straits of Fuca to the Pacific, instead of cutting
                                through Vancouver Island?</p>
                            <p>5. If to secure access to the possessions to the northward of the 49°
                                parallel, state what possession Great Britain held to the northward
                                of 49° and where?</p>
                            <p>6. If the free navigation of the straits and adjacent channel was not
                                    <pb n="115" xml:id="pg_115" facs="0141"/>guaranteed to Great
                                Britain, how could access be obtained to those possessions north of
                                49°?</p>
                            <p>7. When the Treaty was signed in June, 1846, and previous to that
                                date, which channel was known and used by vessels amongst the
                                islands forming the Archipelagos between Vancouver’s Island and the
                                continent, to get access to our dominions north of 49°?</p>
                            <p>8. Forward proofs and affidavits, legally attested, by captains of
                                vessels and others who made use of the channel then known, and their
                                reasons for making use of it.</p>
                            <p>9. Previous to the signing of the treaty in 1846, and also at that
                                time, how many channels were known to be navigable amongst the
                                islands forming the Archipelago between Vancouver Island and the
                                continent of America?</p>

                            <p>*I have been on the Northwest Pacific coast since A. D. 1840, and
                                during all that time have been in the Hudson’s Bay Company’s employ.
                                I have been a Chief Factor since 1859, and a Lloyd’s Agent since
                                1856, and from A. D. 1844 to 1847 I was the Chief Agent of the

                                interrogatory I declare, as aforesaid:</p>
                            <p>1. That about A. D. 1845 and 1846, the Hudson’s Bay Company had a
                                settlement at Langley, on the Fraser River, and the said settlement
                                existed since 1827 or 1828.</p>
                            <p>2. In answer to the second interrogatory, I declare, as aforesaid,
                                that up to A. D. 1845 and 1846, Hudson’s Bay Company’s ships, bound
                                from Honolulu, in the Sandwich Islands, from Fort Vancouver, on the
                                Columbia River, and San Francisco and Sitka, to Langley, passed
                                through Fuca’s Straits and Rosario Straits; also vessels trading
                                between Fort Nisqually and Langley used to pass through Rosario
                                Strait.</p>
                            <p>3. In answer to the third interrogatory, I declare, as aforesaid, to
                                the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, Langley, on the
                                Fraser River, was settled about the year 1827 or 1828.</p>
                            <p>4. In answer to the fourth interrogatory, I declare, as aforesaid,
                                that about the time of the negotiation of the Treaty of June, 1846,
                                the common opinion as to the object of Great Britain in insisting on
                                the forty-ninth parallel being deflected in a southerly direction,
                                and through the Straits of Fuca to the Pacific, instead of cutting
                                through Vancouver Island, was that it was to secure access to her
                                possessions to the northward of the forty-ninth parallel through the
                                Straits of Fuca.</p>
                            <p>5. In answer to the fifth interrogatory, I declare, as aforesaid,
                                that Great Britain then held British Columbia up to parallel of
                                north latitude 54° 40′, and Vancouver Island.</p>
                            <p>6. In answer to the sixth interrogatory, I declare, as aforesaid,
                                that if the free navigation of the straits and adjacent channel was
                                not guaranteed by Great Britain, access could only be secured and
                                obtained to those possessions by ships going to the westward of
                                Vancouver Island; and as regards those possessions on the coast of
                                British Columbia, between the fifty-first and forty-ninth parallel,
                                access would have to be sought through a strait which is intricate
                                and difficult of navigation by reason of the strength of the
                                tides.</p>
                            <p>7 and 8. In answer to the seventh and eighth questions, I declare, as
                                    <pb n="116" xml:id="pg_116" facs="0142"/>aforesaid, that when
                                the Treaty was signed in June, 1846, and previous to that date, the
                                channel which was known and used by vessels among the islands
                                forming the Archipelago between Vancouver Island and the continent,
                                to get access to the dominions of Great Britain north of the
                                forty-ninth parallel, was the Strait of Rosario, and that channel
                                only; and it was the only surveyed channel.</p>
                            <p>9. In answer to the ninth interrogatory, I declare, as aforesaid,
                                that previous to the signing of the Treaty in 1846, and also at that
                                time, the only channel known to be navigable among the islands
                                forming the Archipelago between Vancouver Island and the continent
                                was the Strait of Rosario.</p>
                            <p>And I further declare, as aforesaid, that in A. D. 1840, I went from
                                the Hudson’s Bay Company’s Station at Nisqually, Puget Sound, in the
                                steamer Beaver, to Sitka, through Rosario Strait and Johnson Strait;
                                and, in A. D. 1843, I returned from Sitka and other stations through
                                Johnson Strait and Rosario Strait to Vancouver Island in the
                                Beaver.</p>
                            <p>Previous to A. D. 1846, Rosario Strait was the channel for vessels
                                coming to Victoria from Eraser River and the Northwest Pacific
                                coast, or going from Victoria thereto.</p>
                            <p>And I, Roderick Finlayson, above named, solemnly declare that I make
                                the above statements conscientiously, believing the same to be true,
                                and by virtue of the provisions of an act made and passed in the
                                sixth year of the reign of His Majesty King William IV, intituled
                                “An act to repeal an act of the present session of Parliament,
                                intituled ‘An act for the more effectual abolition of oaths and
                                affirmations taken and made in various departments of the state, and
                                to substitute declarations in lieu thereof, and for the more entire
                                suppression of voluntary and extra-judicial oaths and affidavits,
                                and to make other provisions for the abolition of unnecessary
                                oaths.’”</p>

                        <p>The United States on the 12th of December last presented their Memorial,
                            on the Canal de Haro as the boundary line of the United States of
                            America, to the Imperial Arbitrator, and to the representative of Her
                            Britannic Majesty’s Government at Berlin. To the Case of the Government
                            of Her Britannic Majesty, likewise submitted at that time, they now
                            offer their reply. A formal answer to every statement in the British
                            Case to which they take exception, would require a wearisome analysis of
                            almost every one of its pages. They hold it sufficient, to point out a
                            few of the allegations which they regard as erroneous; to throw light
                            upon the argument on which the British principally rest their Case; to
                            establish the consistency of the American Government by tracing the
                            controversy through all its changes to its present form; and, lastly, to
                            apply to the interpretation of the Treaty some of the principles which
                            Her Britannic Majesty’s Government itself has invoked.</p>
                        <p rend="center">I.—THE BRITISH CASE.</p>
                        <p>The argument of Her Britannic Majesty’s Government has kept in the
                            background the clear words of the Treaty describing the boundary, and
                            has made no attempt to bring *them into harmony with the British claim.
                            On the contrary, in the statement of the question submitted for
                            arbitration, it assumes that the Treaty of 1871 sneaks “as if there were
                            more than one channel between the continent and Vancouver Island through
                            which the boundary may be run.” The United States are of the opinion
                            that the Treaty of 1846 designates the Haro Channel precisely as the
                            only channel of the boundary. The words are: “The channel that separates
                            the continent from Vancouver Island;” and there is but one such channel.
                            The so-called Straits of Rosario touch neither the continent nor
                            Vancouver Island.<seg type="margin">[4]</seg><seg type="margin">British
                                Case, p. 3.</seg></p>
                        <p>The name of the continent of South America, as used by geographers,
                            includes the group of islands south of the Straits of Magellan. The
                            continent of Asia includes Ceylon and Sumatra; the continent of Europe
                            includes Great Britain and Ireland, and the Hebrides. Asia Minor
                            includes Lesbos, and Scio, and Samos, and Rhodes, and Tenedos; and so
                            the continent of North America includes all adjacent islands, to the
                            great Pacific.</p>
                        <p>Were the question to be asked, “What channel separates the continent of
                            Europe from Candia?” the answer would not draw the line north of the
                            greater part of the Ægean Archipelago, but, like all European diplomacy,
                            would point to the channel south of Santorin. In like manner, when the
                            Treaty speaks of “that channel which separates the continent from
                            Vancouver Island,” nothing is excepted but Vancouver Island itself.</p>
                        <p>The United States assented, in 1871, to no more than that Great Britain
                            might lay her pretensions before an impartial tribunal, all the while
                            believing and avowing, that the simple statement which has just been
                            made is absolutely conclusive on the point submitted for
                            arbitration.</p>
                        <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124" facs="0150"/>
                        <p>The British Case seeks to draw an inference unfavorable to the American
                            demand from the proviso in the Treaty of 1846 which secures to either
                            party the free navigation of the whole *of Fuca’s Straits. It is quite
                            true that the right was safe, and was known to be safe “under the public
                            law;” yet it appears from documents printed at the time, that, as the
                            recent assertion by the Russian Government of a claim to the exclusive
                            navigation of a part of the Northern Pacific Ocean was recollected, it
                            was thought best to insert the superfluous clause, recognizing the
                            straits of Fuca as an arm of the sea.<seg type="margin">British Case, p.

                        <p>The British argument seems suited to mislead by its manner of using the
                            name “straits of Rosario.” The first channel from the straits of Fuca to
                            the north, that was discovered and partly examined in 1790, was the
                            Canal de Haro. The expedition under Lieutenant Eliza explored that
                            channel in June, 1791, with the greatest industry and care, and
                            discovered the broad water which is its continua tion to the north. That
                            water, lying altogether to the north of the northern termination of Haro
                            Channel, was named by the expedition, El Gran Canal de Neustra Señora
                            del Rosario la Marinera. Thus the Canal de Haro and the true Spanish
                            Channel of Rosario form at once the oldest historical continuous
                            channel, as it is the one continuous boundary-channel of the Treaty of
                                1846.<seg type="margin">British Case, pp. 10, 32.</seg><seg

                        <p>The passage which the British authorities now call the Straits of
                            Rosario, appears as early as 1791 on the map of Eliza as the Channel of
                            Fidalgo. Vancouver, coming after Eliza, transferred the name of Rosario
                            to the strait east of the island of Texada. The British Admiralty, soon
                            after receiving the surveys made under its orders in 1847 by Captain
                            Kellett, suddenly removed the name of the straits of Rosario from the
                            narrow water between the continent and the island of Texada, where it
                            had remained on British maps for fifty years, to the passage which the
                            Spaniards called the chan nel of Fidalgo. And yet the Government of Her
                            Britannic Majesty advances the assertion, that “how the name has come to
                            be” so “applied in modern days does not appear.” For this act of the
                            British Admiralty in February, 1849, there exists no historical
                            justification whatever.<seg type="margin">Map K.</seg><seg type="margin"

                        <p>The British Case exaggerates the importance of the voyage of Captain
                            Vancouver. So far were American fur-traders from following his guidance,
                            they were his forerunners and teachers. Their early voyages are among
                            the most marvelous events in the history of commerce. So soon as the
                            Independence of the United States was acknowledged by Great Britain, the
                            strict enforcement of the old, unrepealed navigation laws cut them off
                            from their former haunts of commerce, and it became a question from what
                            ports American ships could bring home coffee, and sugar, and spices, and
                            tea. All British colonies were barred against them as much as were those
                            of Spain. So American ships sailed into eastern oceans, where trade with
                            the natives was free. The great Asiatic <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125"
                                facs="0151"/>commerce poured wealth into the lap of the new
                            republic, and Americans, observing the fondness of the Chinese for furs,
                            sailed fearlessly from the Chinese seas or round Cape Horn to the
                            northwest coast of America in quest of peltry to exchange for the costly
                            fabrics and products of China. They were in the waters of northwest
                            America long before the Hudson’s Bay Company. We know, alike from
                            British and from Spanish authorities, that an American sloop, fitted out
                            at Boston in New England, and commanded by Captain Kendrick, passed
                            through the straits of Fuca just at the time when the American
                            Constitution went into operation—two years before Vancouver, and even
                            before Quimper and de Haro. Americans did not confine themselves to one
                            passage in preference to others, but entered every *channel, and inlet,
                            and harbor, where there was a chance of trafficking with a red Indian
                            for skins; and they handed down from one to another the results of their
                                discoveries.<seg type="margin">Meare’s Voyage. lvi, 235. Vancouver’s

                        <p>The instruction from the British Admiralty to Captain Vancouver was
                            prompted by an account, which they had seen, of the voyage of Kendrick,
                            and the belief, derived from that account, that the waters of the
                            Pacific might reach far into the American continent. Vancouver was
                            therefore instructed to search for channels and rivers leading into the
                            interior of the continent, the farther to the south the better, in the
                            hope that water communication might be found even with the Lake of the
                            Woods. In conformity to these instructions, founded on the voyage of
                            Americans, he entered the straits of Fuca, and keeping always as near as
                            he could to the eastern shore, he vainly searched the coast to the
                            southern limit of Puget Sound. Turning to the north, he passed through
                            the channel of Fidalgo, or the spurious Rosario, because his
                            instructions required him to keep near the shore of the continent.<seg

                        <p>The inference of Her Britannic Majesty’s Government, that the so-called
                            Rosario Strait is the channel of the Treaty because Vancouver sailed
                            through it, is a fallacy. He never committed such a mistake as to
                            represent the so-called Rosario, which he apparently did not even think
                            worthy of a name, as being comparable to the channel of Haro.</p>
                        <p>The argument of Her Britannic Majesty’s Government misstates the
                            character and exaggerates the value of the chart of Vancouver by
                            assuming that he prepared directions to mariners for navigation. But the
                            chart which is produced is only one map among many, never published
                            apart from a work, too voluminous, expensive, and rare to find a place
                            on board the small vessels of fur-traders. The line on his map is
                            nothing more nor less than the track of his own course while engaged in
                            explorations under controlling instructions, and is a track which no
                            ship has followed or is likely to follow.</p>
                        <p>*The British argument frequently refers to the soundings taken by
                            Vancouver in the Fidalgo-Rosario Channel. Only two such soundings appear
                            on his map, while there are five or six on an arm of the Canal de Haro,
                            and one on its edge, showing that its waters were found to be more than
                            two hundred feet deep. The chart of these waters for mariners, published
                            by the Spaniards in 1795, exhibits many soundings to facilitate the use
                            of the Canal de Haro. If this excellent chart contains no soundings in
                            the great center of the channel of Haro, it is for a reason to which
                            Vancouver repeatedly refers, that the usual soundinglines of those days
                            were not long enough to touch bottom in the deep waters where walls of
                            igneous rock go perpendicularly down hundreds of feet, close even to the
                            shore. “Even nearest the islands,” <pb n="126" xml:id="pg_126"
                                facs="0152"/>writes De Eliza, “we could not find bottom with a line
                            of forty fathoms.” “Proximo à las islas, no se encuentra fondo con 40
                                brazas.”<seg type="margin">[8]</seg><seg type="margin">British Case,

                        <p>The British Case assigns in like manner an undue prominence to the trade
                            in the Vancouver waters prior to the treaty of 1846. As to general
                            commerce, there was none. As to settlements, properly so called, there
                            could be none; for under the British treaty with Spain, and the treaty
                            of non-occupation between the United States and Great Britain, impliedly
                            at least, there could be no grants or holdings of territory by
                            individuals or companies of either party. The American voyages on the
                            northwest coast were entirely broken up by the maritime orders and acts
                            of England which preceded the war of 1812; and the American fur-trade
                            never recovered from the effects of that war. The trade became a
                            monopoly of the Hudson’s Bay Company, and that company boasted
                            officially that “they compelled the Americans one by one to withdraw
                            from the contest.” The United States acknowledge that the boast was
                            true. At rare intervals of years, Americans may have entered Fuca’s
                            Straits, but a careful search fails to discover proof that even one
                            single United States vessel sailed into those waters between the year
                            1810 and the * arrival of the American Exploring Expedition under Wilkes
                            in 1841. A monopoly of the trade was maintained by the Hudson’s Bay
                            Company, not against Americans only, but against all ships but their
                            own. What then becomes of the British argument, that trading-vessels of
                            other nations were in all that time not known to pass through the Canal
                            de Haro?<seg type="margin">British Case, pp. 11, 32.</seg><seg

                        <p>The Hudson’s Bay Company was once a company of commercial importance, as
                            well as of political influence, But the hunting-ground over which it
                            ranged was enormously wide, stretching from Labrador to California and
                            to the Russian settlements in northwestern America. They could spare
                            very little of their limited resources for the waters around San Juan
                            Island. Their leading settlement in the West, until 1843, was at Fort
                            Vancouver on Columbia River. Of shipping in their employ, nothing is
                            heard for many years, except of one small steamer, the Beaver, and of
                            one small schooner, the Cadboro. Wilkes in 1841 met only the Beaver.
                            These vessels were accustomed twice a year to make the trip from Fort
                            Vancouver to the various posts, to distribute supplies and to collect
                            furs. If in these trips they chose to pass through the Fidalgo-Rosario
                            channel, rather than the Canal de Haro, the British Case has omitted to
                            state the reason of the choice. In the semi-annual trip from Fort
                            Vancouver to the trading posts, the first one that was visited was
                            Nisqually, at the head of Puget Sound. A vessel sailing from that part
                            of the United States to Fraser’s River would naturally pass through the
                            Fidalgo-Rosario channel. To have taken any other would have been
                            circuitous. A geographical sketch is annexed, from which the reason will
                            appear why the vessels on these trips passed through the so-called
                            Rosario Straits; not because it was the great channel from the Straits
                            of Juan de Fuca to the north, but because it was the shortest passage
                            between Nisqually in Puget Sound and Fort Langley on Fraser’s River. The
                            return voyage, when there was no need of touching at Nisqually, was
                            sometimes made by the Channel of Haro.<seg type="margin">Appendix No.

                            exploring expedition, in 1841, the British Case shapes the narrative so
                            as to give the impression that the American expedition regarded the
                            so-called straits of Rosario as superior to the Haro, while the opposite
                            is the truth. Commodore Wilkes, who commanded the expedition, detached a
                            subordinate officer in the Vincennes to survey the channels among the
                            islands of the archipelago; he reserved for himself the more important
                            but less difficult office of surveying the channel of Haro.<seg

                        <p>On the 26th page of the British Case it is asserted that the late Mr.
                            Daniel Webster stated in the Senate of the United States that the great
                            aim of the United States in 1846 was to establish the forty-ninth
                            parallel of north latitude as the line of boundary on the western side
                            of the Rocky Mountains, “not to be departed from for any line further
                            south on the continent.”<seg type="margin">British Case, p.
                            26.</seg></p>
                        <p>The inference drawn from this is, that Mr. Webster demanded the line of
                            the parallel of 49° for “the continent” only, and was indifferent as to
                            “the islands.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. Webster was not at that time a member of the Government of the United
                            States, but the leader of the political minority in the Senate, which
                            opposed the administration of that day. The United States, therefore,
                            may, without questioning the great authority of his name, deny that he
                            is to be received as an interpreter of the views of the cabinet which
                            negotiated the treaty of 1846. It may, however, surprise the Imperial
                            Arbitrator to learn that Mr. Webster not only did not entertain the
                            opinions attributed to him, but expressed himself in a sense exactly the
                                reverse.<seg type="margin">[11]</seg></p>
                        <p>*Some members of the Senate insisted on the parallel of 54° 40′ as the
                            American boundary; Mr. Webster declared himself content with the
                            parallel of 49°. But his words were absolute. The British Case puts
                            words into his mouth which he never uttered. What Mr. Webster said was,
                            that the line of 49° was “not to be departed from for any line further
                            south.” The words “on the continent” are an interpolation made by the
                            British Case. In the same debate and on the same day Mr. Webster, to
                            guard against misrepresentation, observed with great solemnity; “The
                            Senate will do me the justice to allow, that I said as plainly as I
                            could speak, or put down words in writing, that England must not expect

                        <p>Forty years ago the mountain ranges and upland plains from which the
                            water flows to the Gulf of California, or is lost in inland seas, still
                            remained as little known as the head springs of the Congo and of the
                            Nile. Frémont had thrice penetrated those regions, once or more with
                            Preuss in his service as draughtsman. On the return of Frémont from his
                            third expedition, the Senate of the United States, although he was <pb

                            instead of leaving him to seek a publisher, on the 5th and 15th of June,
                            1848, at the instance of Mr. Benton, voted to print his geographical
                            memoir on Upper California, and the map of Oregon and *California,
                            “according to the projection to be furnished by the said J. C.
                                Frémont.”<seg type="margin">[12]</seg></p>
                        <p>In representative governments, each branch of the legislature may order
                            printed what it will; but the order gives no sanction to what is
                            printed. Last winter, for example, the German Diet printed at the public
                            cost, that the German constitution is not worth the paper it is written
                            on. Neither Frémont nor Preuss had ever been within many hundred miles
                            of the straits of Fuca, and Frémont himself says, “The part of the map
                            which exhibits Oregon is chiefly copied from the works of others.” The
                            Senate never saw the map as delivered to the lithographer. The work was
                            printed, not under the revision of officers of the Senate, but solely
                            “subject to the revision of its author.” Except for the regions which he
                            had himself explored, Frémont abandoned the drawing of the map to
                            Preuss, who followed “other authorities.” While Mr. Preuss was compiling
                            his map, Mr. Bancroft, the representative of his country in London, with
                            full authority from the President and Secretary of State of the United
                            States, delivered to the British Government in the clearest words the
                            declaration of his own Government that the boundary line passes through
                            the middle of the Haro channel. Any error of Mr. Preuss was therefore
                            perfectly harmless.<seg type="margin">Senate Miscellaneous Documents No.

                            Mr. Preuss? He was one of the many adventurers who throng to the United
                            States, a mechanic, possessing no scientific culture, and holding his
                            talent as a draughtsman at the command of any who would employ him.</p>
                        <p>The United States are unable to inform the Imperial Arbitrator what
                            authority served as a guide to Mr. Preuss when he drew the Oregon
                            boundary to suit British pretensions. Not Mr. Benton; his opinion was
                            well known. Not the Senate, which is the only permanent body under our
                            Constitution, and which, in the twenty-five years since the treaty was
                            made, has inflexibly maintained the right of the United States to the
                            *Haro boundary. Not Mr. Buchanan, the Secretary of State, whose
                            instructions on the Haro as the boundary, sanctioned by the President
                            and his cabinet, date from the year in which the treaty was made.
                            Neither could Preuss have copied the line from printed materials. No
                            such printed materials existed at that time. A wish expressed by the
                            British minister at Washington slumbered in the Department of State, and
                            was known only to the President and his cabinet.<seg type="margin"

                        <p>Mr. Preuss is no longer living to explain by whom he was misled. Mr.
                            Frémont remembers that Mr. Preuss had among his materials a copy of a
                            manuscript map of the northwest territory by the Hudson’s Bay Company,
                            received from one of its officers. Be this as it may, it is enough for
                            the United States to have shown that the map never had the sanction of
                            any branch of their Government.</p>
                        <p>Analogous mistakes have been made in Great Britain, and under weightier
                            authority. Pending the discussion between the two countries, Messrs.
                            Malby &amp; Co. of London, “manufacturers and publishers to the Society
                            for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge,” sent out a large and splendid
                            globe, on which they assigned to the United States by line and color the
                            whole northwestern territory up to the latitude of 54° 40′.</p>
                        <p>To treat mistakes like these as important is unsuited to negotiations <pb

                            United States do not complain that the map of Preuss is produced by Her
                            Majesty’s Government, for the production of it is a confession of the
                            feebleness of the British Case. They might complain that Her Britannic
                            Majesty’s Government did not state what it hoped to prove by the map.
                            They might complain that it produced the map without an acknowledgment
                            of its well-known worthlessness as an exposition of American opinion.
                            And above all they might complain of the British Government for
                            submitting the map to the Imperial Arbitrator without avowing that its
                            own archives contain a contemporaneous, explicit, and authoritative
                            *declaration from the American Government, that the straits of Haro are

                        <p rend="center">II.—REPLY TO THE ARGUMENTS OF THE BRITISH CASE.</p>
                        <p>Having thus drawn attention to the character of the paper which the
                            Government of Her Britannic Majesty has presented as its Case, its
                            allegations in support of its pretensions are next to be examined. The
                            Government of Her Britannic Majesty presents but one argument, and that
                            argument has two branches. The British Government admits, and even
                            insists, that the channel of the treaty must be a continuous channel
                            from the forty-ninth parallel to the straits of Fuca; and it argues,
                            first, that the strait which is now called Rosario, but which, at the
                            time of making the treaty of 1846, had “no distinguishing name,” must
                            have been the channel contemplated by the treaty, because the British,
                            at that time, “had no assurance” that the canal de Haro “was even
                            navigable;” “had a firm belief that it was a dangerous strait;” and,
                            secondly, that Fuca Straits extend from Cape Flattery to Whidbey Island.
                            In discussing these two points their order will be reversed.</p>
                        <p>First, then, do the straits of Fuca, as now pretended by Great Britain,
                            reach to Whidbey Island? The answer depends in part on the definition of
                            the word “strait.” Her Majesty’s Government forget that the word applies
                            only to a narrow “passage connecting one part of a sea with another.”
                            Such is a lesson taught by all geographers, whether British, or French,
                            or American, or German. As soon as the southeast cape of Vancouver
                            Island is passed, the volume of water spreads into a broad expanse,
                            filled with numerous islands, and becomes a gulf or bay, but is no
                            longer a strait.</p>
                        <p>Neither can it be pretended that any exception takes place in the
                            geographical usage of the name “straits of Fuca,” as employed in all the
                            scientific explorations and maps pre*vious to June, 1846. On the
                            contrary, the pretension is hazarded in the face of them all.<seg

                        <p>The first map of the strait is by the pilot Lopez de Haro; on that the
                            mouth of the so-called strait of Rosario is named Boca de Fidalgo, and
                            the water to the south of it bears the name of the gulf of Santa
                                Rosa.<seg type="margin">Map J</seg></p>
                        <p>The map of Eliza, in 1791, confines the name of the straits of Juan de
                            Fuca to the straits that separate Vancouver Island on the south from the
                            continent; and that officer in his report repeats the name of the gulf
                            of Santa Rosa as the name of the interior waters.<seg type="margin">Map
                                K</seg></p>
                        <p>The explorers in the Sutil and Mexicana, alike in the Spanish chart of
                            1795, and in the map annexed to the publication of their voyage in 1802,
                            call the straits “Entrada,” a Spanish word that can extend to no more
                            than an entrance.<seg type="margin">Map L</seg></p>

                        <p>Next came Vancouver, and the great authority of the British navigator
                            overthrows the British argument beyond room for cavil; for he not only,
                            like all his predecessors, confines the name of Straits of Juan de Fuca
                            to the passage between Vancouver Island on the south and the continent,
                            but, alike in his narrative and on his map, expressly distinguishes
                            those straits from “the interior sea,” which he, with great solemnity,
                            named the gulf of Georgia.<seg type="margin">Map C.</seg></p>
                        <p>The man of Duflot de Mofras, of 1844, and that of Wilkes, in 1845,
                            confine the name of the straits of Fuca strictly to the waters that
                            really form a strait between the continent and the southern line of
                            Vancouver Island.<seg type="margin">Map E.</seg><seg type="margin">Map

                        <p>The government of Her Britannic Majesty cannot produce one single map
                            older than 1846 in defense of its views.</p>
                        <p>The common use of language among the British in Vancouver still
                            corresponds with the undivided testimony of the maps. Pemberton,
                            surveyor-general of Vancouver Island, in a work published in 1860,
                            writes thus of a “stranger steaming, for the first time, eastward into
                            the straits of Juan de Fuca:” *“On his right hand is Washington
                            Territory; on his left is Vancouver Island; straight before him is the
                            gulf of Georgia.”<seg type="margin">Appendix No. 66, pp. 103,
                                104.</seg><seg type="margin">[16]</seg></p>
                        <p>The statement of Commander Mayne is, if possible, still more precise. Of
                            the Strait of Juan de Fuca, he writes in these words: “At the Race
                            Islands the strait may be said to terminate, as it there opens out into
                            a large expanse of water.” Now the Race Islands, or Race Rocks, alike on
                            the British and American maps, lie to the southwest of the channel of
                            Haro. On the point in question there could be no better authority than
                            Commander Mayne, as he is a man of science, and was employed on the
                            surveys during the period in which Captain, now Admiral, Prevost and
                            Captain Richards acted as the British Boundary Commissioners.<seg
                                type="margin">Appendix No. 66, p. 103.</seg></p>
                        <p>But to refute the British assumption, we need not go outside of the
                            British Case itself. On page 27 it claims the chart of Vancouver as the
                            chart according to which Her Majesty’s Government framed the first
                            article of the treaty, and then most correctly says: “The name of the
                            gulf of Georgia is assigned on that chart to the whole of the interior
                                sea.”<seg type="margin">British Case, p 27.</seg></p>
                        <p>Thus this branch of the argument offered by the British Government is in
                            flat contradiction to the proper use of language, to nature, to the
                            concurrent testimony of every competent witness, and is given up before
                            the end of the very paper in which it is presented.</p>
                        <p>We now come to the other branch of the British argument: that prior to
                            1846 there was no assurance that the canal de Haro was even navigable.
                            That channel is now universally acknowledged to be the best and most
                            convenient for the British. It forms the only line of communication
                            regularly used by them. The mail steamers take only that route. It is
                            the broadest, it is the deepest, it is the shortest passage; and so it
                            is the only one used by the government, the traders, the immigrants, and
                            inhabitants of British Columbia. It became the exclusive channel as soon
                            as gold-hunting *lured adventurers to that region, and the navigation of
                            those waters was no longer confined to the vessels coasting from one to
                            another of the trading-posts of the Hudson’s Bay Company. Its
                            superiority appears alike from the chart of the British Admiralty and of
                            the American Coast Survey. A map is annexed exhibiting in several
                            cross-sections the relative depths of its channel.<seg type="margin"

                        <p>In negotiating the treaty neither side had in view the tracks of the few
                            former fur-traders whose course was run; but the great channels provided
                            by nature for future commerce. American statesmen officially foretold at
                            the time to the British negotiators that, under American auspices,
                            flourishing commonwealths, such as we now see in California and Oregon,
                            would rise up on the Pacific.</p>
                        <p>The plea of Lord Aberdeen’s ignorance of the Haro waters rests not on
                            anything real and tangible which can be investigated, but on something
                            purely ideal; on an unspoken, unwritten opinion attributed to him. It
                            was not set up till after the death of Sir Robert Peel, who professed to
                            understand “the local conformation of that country,” and explained it to
                            the House of Commons; nor till after Lord Aberdeen in 1855 had finally
                            retired into private life. It is not pretended by any one that the
                            opinion was well founded; and as it is erroneous in itself, and never
                            obtained the sanction either of Sir Robert Peel or of Lord Aberdeen, it
                            must be classed among the dreams that come from the realm of shades
                            through the ivory gate.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, the attention of Lord Aberdeen, two days before he sent out the
                            treaty to Mr. Pakenham, was specially called to the islands of the Haro
                            Archipelago. On the 15th of May, 1846, he definitively assented, as Mr.
                            MacLane understood him, to the Haro channel as the boundary. On the
                            16th, Sir John Pelly, then governor of the Hudson’s Bay Com*pany, the
                            same who boasted that that company had “compelled” the Americans to
                            withdraw from the fur-trade, waited upon Lord Aberdeen with map in hand,
                            pointed out to him the group of islands, wholly on the south of the
                            parallel of 49°, and described in distinct and unequivocal language, as
                            well “as colored red,” “the water demarkation line” which would secure
                            every one of the Haro islands. Lord Aberdeen, after having his mind thus
                            closely and exactly drawn to the position of those islands, like “the
                            straightforward man” of honor the United States took him for, rejected
                            the “explicit” advice which would, indeed, have prevented the
                            consummation of the treaty; and, in his instructions and in his draught
                            of the treaty, stipulated only for the channel, “leaving the whole of
                            Vancouver’s Island in the possession of Great Britain.”<seg

                        <p>Further, this plea of ignorance in 1846 that the channel of Haro was
                            navigable, is in itself absurd. For what is a channel? canal?
                            Fahrwasser? Seegat? A channel means the depest part of a river, or bay,
                            where the main current flows. The word is never used except of water
                            that is navigable. Geographies are full of the names of channels, and
                            the maps of Europe and Asia are studded with them; and who ever before
                            thought of denying any one of them to be navigable? The present British
                            suggestion is without precedent. To say that the canal de Haro was not
                            known to be navigable is to say that the canal de Haro was not known to
                            be the “canal de Haro.”</p>
                        <p>It is very unlucky for the Government of Her Britannic Majesty that its
                            plea of ignorance relates to the waters inside of Fuca straits. The
                            emoluments of the fur-trade; the Spanish jealousy of Russian
                            encroachments down the Pacific coast; the lingering hope of discovering
                            a northwest passage; the British desire of finding water communication
                            from the Pacific to the great lakes; the French passion for knowledge;
                            the policy of Americans to investigate their outlying possessions; all
                            conspired to cause more frequent and more thorough examina*tions <pb
                                n="132" xml:id="pg_132" facs="0162"/>of these waters, even before
                            1846, than of any similarly situated waters in any part of the
                                globe.<seg type="margin">[19]</seg></p>
                        <p>Before that epoch, the waters east and south of Vancouver Island had been
                            visited by at least six scientific expeditions, from four several
                            nations: three from Spain, one from Great Britain, one from France, and
                            one from the United States; and the discoveries of all the four nations
                            had been laid before the world.</p>
                        <p>De Haro, of the Spanish exploring party of 1789, discovered, and partly
                            sounded and surveyed, the one broad and inviting channel which then
                            seemed, not merely the best, but the only avenue by water to the north;
                            and he left upon it his name.</p>
                        <p>The official reports of the expedition of Lieutenant de Eliza in 1791,
                            and the large and excellent map which accompanied his narrative, prove
                            that on the 31st day of May, 1791, an armed boat was ordered to enter
                            and survey the canal of Lopez de Haro; but the survey was interrupted by
                            the hostile appearance of six Indian canoes, filled by more than a
                            hundred warriors. On the 14th day of June, the exploration of the canal
                            de Haro was resumed, and was continued till the whole line of the canal
                            de Haro was traced from Fuca’s straits to its continuation in the great
                            upper channel.<seg type="margin">Appendix No. 62.</seg></p>
                        <p>But the Imperial Arbitrator may ask if these discoveries were published
                            to the world; and the United States answer that they were published
                            before the end of the century, both in Spain and in England. In 1792 the
                            Spanish vessels Sutil and Mexicana, commanded by Captains Galiano and
                            Valdes, taking with them the map of Lieutenant de Eliza, verified and
                            completed the exploration of the interior waters, The results of the
                            three Spanish expeditions were published officially by Spain in 1795, in
                            an elaborately prepared chart for manners, of which a lithographed copy
                            accompanies this reply.<seg type="margin">Map l.</seg></p>
                        <p>The map of Eliza was also communicated to Vancouver in 1792, at the time
                            when he met Galiano and Valdes, in the *waters east of Vancouver Island.
                            Thus Captain Vancouver became equally well aware of the superiority of
                            the channel of Haro. That he put trust in the communications made to him
                            by the Spaniards, is proved beyond a doubt, for he incorporated them
                            into his map. The discoveries of the Spaniards, enriched by additional
                            surveys of Vancouver himself, were published in Great Britain in 1798,
                            in connection with his voyage. Before the end of the eighteenth century,
                            therefore, the relative importance of the channels in the waters east of
                            Vancouver Island was known to every one who cared to inquire about it,
                            and who could gain access either to the chart published in Cadiz, or to
                            the account of Vancouver’s voyage which was issued in London. Her
                            Majesty’s Government seems certainly to have been in possession of the
                            surveys of Captains D. Galiano and C. Valdes, for in the first chart
                            drawn by the British Admiralty of Vancouver Island and the Gulf of
                            Georgia, and published in February, 1849, they are cited as equal in
                            authority to the chart of Vancouver, and as equally well known.<seg

                            les abris sûrs qu’elles offrent aux navires, présentent à la navigation
                            de grandes difficultés. Le passage le plus facile est par le canal de
                            Haro, entre l’île de Quadra et Vancouver et celle de San Juan.</p>
                        <p>In the space between the continent and the eastern part of the large
                            island of Quadra, there is a multitude of small islands, which, in spite
                            of the safe shelters that they <pb n="133" xml:id="pg_133" facs="0163"
                            />offer to ships, present great; difficulties to navigation. The most
                            easy passage is through the canal de Haro, between the island of Quadra
                            and Vancouver and that of San Juan.</p>
                        <p>The testimony of Duflot de Mofras is clear and unequivocal. It is
                            impartial, and it is authoritative, as it occurs in a formal report to
                            his sovereign.</p>
                        <p>* Commodore Wilkes himself, in 1841, made all the surveys and soundings
                            that were necessary for the safe navigation of the Haro channel, and, in
                            1845, published officially, both in London and America, that he had done
                                so.<seg type="margin">[21]</seg></p>
                        <p>The American adventurers who collected furs in those waters for the trade
                            with China knew the relative value of the two channels. At Boston, in
                            1845, Mr. Sturgis, the great representative of that class, describes the
                            Haro channel correctly as the northernmost navigable channel, and draws
                            the boundary line through the center of its waters. And his pamphlet and
                            his map were known and approved by Lord Aberdeen before the treaty was
                            framed.</p>
                        <p>Thus in Cadiz, in Paris, in Philadelphia, in Boston, and in London, the
                            character of the Haro channel had been publicly made known before the
                            end of 1845.</p>
                        <p>The British claim that the Hudson’s Bay Company navigated those waters
                            from 1827 or 1828 to 1846. Is it credible that for nineteen years they
                            should have sailed a distance of six German miles, and, at the end of
                            that time, be able to affirm that they were ignorant of the most
                            obvious, broadest, shortest, nearest, and best channel to Fraser’s
                            River? Unless they took the channel of Haro, they must have passed it
                            twice on every voyage, and a sailor, from the mast-head of a vessel, or
                            even from the deck, could have seen it in all or nearly all its
                            extent.</p>
                        <p>Governor Douglas, one of the most enterprising and inquisitive of men,
                            famous for his “intimate acquaintance with every crevice on the coast,”
                            came in 1842, with the knowledge and approval of Lord Aberdeen, to
                            select the station for the Hudson’s Bay Company near the southeast of
                            Vancouver. From the hill that bears his name, his eye could have
                            commanded the whole of the canal de Haro, and his experience of the sea
                            would have revealed to him at a glance the great depth of its waters.
                            Moreover, in a good boat, with a favoring wind and tide, he could have
                            passed through the whole channel *in less than three hours. To say that
                            he was not thoroughly well aware of its merits is, to those who know the
                            character of the man, beyond the bounds of credibility.<seg

                        <p>The British Government has not produced one particle of evidence of an

                            all possibility of doubt, that before the treaty of 1846 the superiority

                            more groundless the more it is examined. It would be difficult to state
                            too strongly the objections which any British court of law would make to
                            it. The declarations are taken by the one party without notice to the

                            Governor Douglas, are passed by; for they could not be expected to
                            stultify themselves by pleading ignorance of the merits of <pb n="134"

                            testimony to that about which they knew nothing. A set of written
                            questions is presented to them, and in different places, and on
                            different days, they answer in large part in the same words, implying
                            that answers, as well as questions, were prepared beforehand. The
                            testimony thus picked up is of the less value, as the witnesses were not
                            cross-examined; and yet, without being confronted or cross-examined,
                            they involve themselves in contradictions if not in falsehoods.</p>
                        <p>The questions are framed so as to seem to be to the point, and yet most
                            of them are of no significance.</p>
                        <p>William H. McNeill pretends to have used Vancouver’s charts, not knowing
                            that Vancouver made no charts except as an illustration of his own
                            voyage. Then he affirms that * in coming south from Fraser’s River he
                            went through Rosario straits; while the Rosario straits on Vancouver’s
                            map lie far to the north of Fraser’s River. Again, he says that the
                            navigation of Haro straits is much impeded by numerous small islands and
                            rocks; whereas it may be seen by the charts of the British Admiralty, as
                            well as those of the United States Coast Survey, that the channel is
                            broad and singularly deep, and where the bottom is marked rocky, the
                            soundings show a depth of three hundred, six hundred, and even a
                            thousand feet. The same man puts his name to the statement that what he
                            calls the strait of Rosario was the only surveyed channel; whereas the
                            canal de Haro had been surveyed both by Spanish and American
                                expeditions.<seg type="margin">British Case, pp. 48, 49.</seg><seg

                        <p>William Mitchell testifies twice over that the so-called Rosario strait
                            was the only known channel; while the channel of Haro appears on the
                            Spanish chart, on the French, on the American, and is given by Vancouver
                            himself. The same William Mitchell testifies, like McNeill, and equally
                            falsely, that in June, 1846, the straits of Rosario, so called, were the
                            only surveyed channel.<seg type="margin">British Case, p. 51.</seg></p>
                        <p>But Alexander C. Anderson exceeds others in alacrity. He testifies that
                            as late as 1851 the passage through the Haro strait was incompletely
                            known. Now the large charts prepared by Wilkes and his officers had been
                            for several years exposed for sale to anybody that chose to buy them,
                            and it is absolutely certain that they were presented by the American
                            minister at London to Lord Palmerston, British Secretary of State for
                            Foreign Affairs, and by him thankfully acknowledged, in the year 1848;
                            so that the Government of Her Britannic Majesty happily possesses the
                            means of correcting the rash declarations of the last-named witness.<seg

                        <p>The American Government cannot offer the rebutting testimony of American
                            mariners, for their fur-trade on the northwest coast had been broken up
                            by the British before 1810, and when at a later day they attempted to
                            renew it, they *had been forcibly compelled by the officers and servants
                            of the Hudson’s Bay Company to give up the field. The American sailors,
                            therefore, who were familiar with those regions have long since gone to
                            slumber with their fathers.<seg type="margin">[24]</seg></p>
                        <p>But the British Case enables the American Government to cite the
                            log-books of the Hudson’s Bay Company. It nowhere ventures to say that
                            the log-books of the vessels of the Hudson’s Bay Company prove that they
                            never went through the Haro channel, but only that they used the
                            so-called Rosario straits as the “leading channel.” This is a confession
                            that the log-books of those vessels show that sometimes one channel was
                            used by them, sometimes the other. It is admitted by the British Case
                            that in 1843 the Cadboro sailed through Haro straits, and that once, at
                            least, the <pb n="135" xml:id="pg_135" facs="0165"/>Hudson’s Bay
                            Company’s steamer Beaver chose the same route. Commander Mayne admits
                            that when the Hudson’s Bay Company established their headquarters at
                            Victoria, the canal de Haro became used. In corroboration of this use of
                            the channel of Haro, especially from the year 1842 to 1846, some
                            affidavits and statements are offered, correcting the testimony
                            contained in the British Case, and confirming facts which the British
                            Case itself admits. From the want of time, no notice could be given to
                            the other party; but among the witnesses will be found some of the
                            highest officers in the Army and Navy of the United State, as well as
                            men known by their works to the scientific world.<seg type="margin"

                        <p>It is a remarkable characteristic of the British Case, that while it
                            seems to make assertions in language of the most energetic affirmation,
                            it qualifies them so as to make them really insignificant. It might
                            almost be said that the British Case gives up its own theory of the
                            ignorance of Lord Aberdeen as to the character of the Haro channel; for
                            it affirms, not that he was ignorant about its navigability, but that he
                            “had no assurance that it was even navigable in its upper waters.”</p>
                        <p>“No assurance” is a very vague expression; so is *the phrase “upper
                            waters;” and with them both nothing is asserted, while the form of the
                            statement is an ample confession that Lord Aberdeen was at least
                            perfectly well acquainted with the existence of the strait. When, using
                            the same words with which they introduced their total misapprehension of
                            Mr. Webster’s opinion, they write of the Haro channel, “It is not too
                            much to say that Her Majesty’s Government had a firm belief that it was
                            a dangerous strait,” it is enough to reply that not one word has been
                            presented to show that Lord Aberdeen believed it a dangerous strait; and
                            without his positive testimony, which has not been produced, this is an
                            idle and groundless assertion.<seg type="margin">British Case, p.

                        <p>Strange as it is for a great nation to come before a tribunal like that
                            of the German Emperor, and complain that the treaty which they
                            themselves draughted contains an ambiguity due, not to bad faith, but to
                            ignorance, the United States have avowed themselves ready to abrogate
                            that part of the treaty on the ground alleged by the British Government,
                            that it might have been made under a mutual misunderstanding; and to
                            re-arrange the boundary which was in dispute before the treaty was
                            concluded. When put to the test, the British are compelled practically
                            to acknowledge the candor and forbearance of the Americans in the
                            formation of the treaty, and that, if the work were to be done over
                            again, they have no hope of a settlement so much to their advantage. The
                            treaty, as it is understood by the United States, made very large
                            concessions to Great Britain; and the British Government insists upon
                            preserving it.<seg type="margin">Proctocols 36 and 37 of Conference

                        <p>Then, since Her Majesty’s Government will not consent to cancel the
                            treaty, it must be accepted according to its plain meaning; and if its
                            meaning is not plain, the party which draughted it must suffer the
                            consequences of the ambiguity.</p>

                        <p>The United States have always held the treaty to be free from ambiguity,

                            none, the British Government intended to take the channel without a
                            name, it should have described it with distinctness and care; instead of

                        <p>In January, 1848, the British minister at Washington, treating the
                            “islets” of the San Juan archipelago as of “little or no value”
                            expressed a “wish” to the United States that the passage used by
                            Vancouver in passing from Admiralty Inlet to the north, might be
                            mutually considered as the channel of the treaty. No claim whatever was
                            preferred, and the wish was excused, “because otherwise much time might
                            be wasted in surveying the various intricate channels formed by the
                            numerous islets which lie between Vancouver’s Island and, the main-land,
                            and some difficulty might arise in deciding which of those channels
                            ought to be adopted for the dividing boundary.” The letter of Lord
                            Palmerston, under which the British minister at Washington expressed
                            this wish of Her Majesty’s Government, has never been communicated to

                            presented any counter claim; and the American minister was persuaded
                            that danger to the immediate peaceful execution of the treaty arose, not
                            from within the ministry, but from the parlia*mentary influence of the
                            Hudson’s Bay Company, whose desires the ministry seemed reluctant to

                        <p>Mr. Bancroft did not suffer the authoritative interpretation of the
                            treaty on the part of his Government to rest on the uncertainty of

                        <p>On the last day of July, 1848, Lord Palmerston observed that he had no
                            good chart of the Oregon waters; and having asked to see a traced copy
                            of Wilkes’ chart, Mr. Bancroft immediately sent it to him with this
                            remark:</p>
                        <p>* * Unluckily this copy does not extend quite so far north as the
                            parallel of 49°, though it contains the wide entrance into the straits
                            of Haro, the channel through the middle of which the boundary is to be
                            continued. The upper part of the straits of Haro is laid down, though
                            not on a large scale, in Wilkes’ map of the Oregon Territory.</p>
                        <p>Obtaining from Washington an early copy of Wilkes’ surveys, Mr. Bancroft
                            delivered it to Lord Palmerston with the following official note: <quote

                        <p>Here is no pretense of an ignorance of the channel of Haro as affecting
                            the interpretation of the treaty—that theory was not started until after
                            the death of Sir Robert Peel—but a calm, wise, assent to the use of the
                            large charts of Wilkes in running the boundary. And this assent was
                            virtually a concession that the American interpretation was just and
                            true. Lord Palmerston declined all controversy about the channel. He
                            received a formal, authoritative statement of the line as understood by
                            the United States, and in his *reply made no complaint and proposed no
                            other interpretation. This note is the first and the last and the only
                            word that the United States possess from Lord Palmerston under his own
                            hand on the subject of the boundary. The correspondence relating to it
                            is inserted in full in the Appendix. The American minister of that day
                            had very good opportunity to know what was going forward, and every
                            motive to give the most correct information to his Government.<seg

                        <p>In December, 1852, Lord Aberdeen came to the head of affairs. The last
                            official word of the Americans to Great Britain on the boundary had been
                            that it passes through the center of the channel of Haro. At the
                            beginning of his ministry, in the winter of 1852–’53, the territorial
                            legislature of Oregon included the whole of the archipelago of Haro in
                            one of its counties. Had Lord Aberdeen been dissatisfied with the state
                            of the question, he, who made the treaty and now had returned to power,
                            was bound to have taken this subject earnestly in hand; but he remained
                            silent, made no excuses that he had draughted the treaty in ignorance,
                            and entered no counter pretension to the American view.</p>
                        <p>The administration which, in February, 1855, succeeded that of Lord
                            Aberdeen, was one over which the Hudson’s Bay Company exercised great
                            influence. The progress of colonization demanded a settlement of the
                            question of jurisdiction—the more so, as the British Government had made
                            a grant of the island of Vancouver to that company. Accordingly, in 1856
                            the two Governments agreed to send out commissioners to mark the line of
                            boundary.</p>
                        <p>The United States, in perfect good faith, gave their commissioner full
                            powers, and communicated his instructions unreservedly to the British
                            Government. The British Government gave its commissioner ostensible
                            instructions, which were readily communicated to the United States, but
                            fettered him by additional ones, which were kept secret, and of which
                            the United States repeatedly but vainly solicited a copy, *until, some
                            years later, Lord Malmesbury, in the ministry of Lord Derby, became once
                            more Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.<seg type="margin"

                        <p>Could the Hudson’s Bay Company obtain possession of the island of San
                            Juan, they would have exclusive possession of the best channel, and of
                            the only safe one in time of war. No British authority in Great Britain
                            or in Vancouver expressed any desire for the so-called Rosario channel,
                            on which the British Case now affects to lay so much stress. The members
                            of Her Britannic Majesty’s Government did not pretend among themselves
                            to a right to it “as the channel indicated by the words of the treaty,”
                            but, yielding to the importunity of the influential government of
                            Vancouver, they were willing to hazard an experimental attempt <pb
                                n="138" xml:id="pg_138" facs="0168"/>to gain the island of San Juan.
                            To accomplish this end, the British commissioner received the following
                            secret instruction:</p>
                        <p>If the commissioner of the United States will not adopt the line along
                            Rosario Strait, and if, on a detailed and accurate survey, and on
                            weighing the evidence on both sides of the question, you should be of
                            opinion that the claims of Her Majesty’s Government to consider Rosario
                            Strait as the channel indicated by the words of the treaty cannot be
                            substantiated, you would be at liberty to adopt any othor intermediate
                            channel which you may discover, on which the United States commissioner
                            and yourself may agree as substantially in accordance with the
                            description of the treaty.<seg type="margin">Appendix No. 69, P.

                        <p>According to his commission, and according to his ostensible
                            instructions, Captain Prevost was a commissioner, and no more than a
                            commissioner, to mark the boundary line according to the treaty of 1846;
                            but by his secret instructions, which he resolutely refused to
                            communicate, he was in fact a plenipotentiary appointed to negotiate for
                            a channel which should take the island of San Juan from the United
                            States. examination and the weighing of evidence on both sides of the
                            question, he “should be of opinion that the claims of Her Majesty’s
                            Government to consider Rosario Strait as the channel indicated by the
                            words of the treaty cannot be substantiated.” After having been five
                            months within the straits of Fuea, and after having verified and
                            approved the accuracy of the United States Coast Survey chart of the
                            channels and islands between Vancouver Island and the continent, and
                            after consenting to It must be borne in mind that Captain Prevost had
                            authority to offer a compromise only on the condition that, after
                            personal adopt it for the purpose of determining the boundary line, he
                            proposed such a compromise as would have left to the United States the
                            so-called Rosario Straits and every island in the archipelago except San
                                Juan.<seg type="margin">[31]</seg><seg type="margin">Appendix No.

                        <p>The commissioner of the United States, Mr. Archibald Campbell, divined
                            the character of the secret instructions under which Captain Prevost was
                            acting, adhered with intelligence and uprightness to his duty as
                            commissioner, and “declined to accede to any compromise.”<seg
                                type="margin">Appendix No. 72, p. 110, 1, 5,6.</seg></p>
                        <p>Captain Prevost, the British commissioner, who, by his offer of
                            compromise, had conceded that the British claim to the so-called Rosario
                            straits “cannot be substantiated,” struggled hard to recover the
                            position of a zealous champion of the right of Great Britain to that
                            channel. But for this he had drifted too far, and he was too honest to
                            succeed. As an interpreter of the treaty Captain Prevost writes very
                            correctly: “The channel mentioned should possess three characteristics:
                            1. It should separate the continent from Vancouver’s Island; 2. It
                            should admit of the boundary line being carried through the middle of,
                            it in a southerly direction; 3. It should be a navigable channel.” He
                            adds: “It is readily admitted that the Canal de Arro is a navigable
                            channel, and therefore answers to one characteristic of the channel of
                            the treaty.”<seg type="margin">Appendix No. 70.</seg></p>
                        <p>*This admission, written from on board a ship anchored within sight of
                            the Haro channel, is conclusive as to the first point. As to his second
                            characteristic, a glance at the map will show the Imperial Arbitrator
                            that the line which is drawn due south from the middle of the channel on
                            the parallel of 49°, strikes the channel of Haro, and leaves the
                            so-called Rosario far to the east.<seg type="margin">[32]</seg><seg

                        <p>As to Captain Prevost’s remaining characteristic, the United States again
                            cite his testimony, for he writes: “The canal de Haro is the channel
                            separating Vancouver’s Island from the continent.” <pb n="139"
                                xml:id="pg_139" facs="0169"/>To be sure be adds, it “cannot be the
                            channel which separates the continent from Vancouver Island.” But in
                            that ground no anchor can hold. It is as if one were to own, that in
                            latitude 53° 10′, St. George’s channel separates Ireland from England,
                            and yet insist that England is separated from Ireland by the strait of

                            now Earl Russell, was the chief, the British minister at Washington,
                            timidly and by way of experiment, expressed a wish that the channel
                            through which Vancouver sailed might be agreed upon by the two
                            Governments as the boundary.<seg type="margin">Appendix No.

                            the disruption of the United States, were already spreading their
                            baleful influences, Lord John Russell, then British Secretary of State
                            for Foreign Affairs, first ventured upon a distinct avowal of the
                            purpose of Her Britannic Majesty’s Government to obtain the island of
                            San Juan. In pursuing this object, he sought, in an interview with the
                            Earl of Aberdeen, to obtain the support of that minister.<seg

                        <p>The chief interest in this narrative, as far as persons are concerned,
                            centers in Lord Aberdeen. So far as the United States know, he never
                            consented to set his hand to any paper which they would have a right to
                            regard as disingenuous. The United States have shown in their memo*rial
                            that Mr. MacLane, after an interview with Lord Aberdeen on the 15th of
                            May, 1846, reported to his Government that the treaty line would pass
                            through the canal de Haro.<seg type="margin">[33]</seg><seg

                        <p>The present agent of the United States in this arbitration resided as
                            minister in England during the three years following the treaty, became
                            well acquainted with Lord Aberdeen, conversed with him on its
                            interpretation, and never heard from him one word that conflicted with
                            the report of Mr. MacLane. Nor did he ever hear a different
                            interpretation of the treaty from Sir Robert Peel. Nor during his whole
                            residence in England did he ever hear such difference of interpretation
                            attributed by any one to either of the two.</p>
                        <p>And, in 1859, Lord Aberdeen is appealed to by Lord John Russell for the
                            aid of his testimony. Unhappily there exists no written answer of his
                            own to the questions put to him; but only a very short report of the
                            interview by Lord John Russell. According to that report, Lord Aberdeen
                            did not deny that he used the name of the canal de Haro with Mr.
                            MacLane, though he had no recollection of having done so. Now, nothing
                            is more likely than that the words uttered in conversation thirteen
                            years before, might have dropped from his memory; and against this
                            failure of memory is to be weighed the dispatch of Mr. MacLane, written
                            at the moment of the conversation. But, as to the channel which Lord
                            Aberdeen had in view, he is represented as declaring that he knew none
                            other than that “described in the treaty itself.” Now, the channel
                            described in the treaty, and in Lord Aberdeen’s instructions to Mr.

                        <p>Left without support by Lord Aberdeen, the British Foreign Office brought
                            forward, as its witness, Sir Richard Pakenham, who, with Mr. Buchanan,
                            signed the boundary treaty of June, 1846.<seg type="margin"

                        <p>In that same year, while everything was still fresh in *memory, Mr.
                            Buchanan had recorded his interpretation of the treaty in an instruction
                            to Mr. Bancroft, the American minister at London, who, as his colleague
                            in Washington, had taken part in its negotiation, and <pb n="140"
                                xml:id="pg_140" facs="0170"/>knew every step of its progress. An
                            instruction written under such circumstances is the portraiture of the
                            inmost mind of its author. “It is not probable,” wrote Mr. Buchanan.
                            “that any claim will be seriously preferred on the part of Her Britannic
                            Majesty’s Government to any island lying to the eastward of the Canal of
                            Arro, as marked in Captain Wilkes’s ‘map of the Oregon Territory.”’<seg

                        <p>Of the testimony, given more than twelve years later by Sir Richard
                            Pakenham, every word, as far as communicated to the United States, is
                            presented in the Appendix. It has no date, but was communicated to the
                            United States in the year 1859. Captain Prevost, in his final letter to
                            Mr. Campbell, the American commissioner, of November 24, 1857, had
                            written: “I will at once frankly state how far I am willing to concede,
                            but beyond what I now offer I can no further go. * * * I am willing to
                            regard the space above described [that is, the space between the
                            continent and Vancouver Island, south of 49°] as one channel, having so
                            many different passages through it, and I will agree to a boundary line
                            being run through the ‘middle’ of it, in so far as islands will permit.”
                            This is the lead which Sir Richard Pakenham followed. He who signed the
                            treaty on the British side declared positively, as his interpretation of
                            it, that the so-called straits of Rosario are not the channel intended
                            by the treaty; and we must hold the British Government to this
                            confession, as it received its official approbation.<seg type="margin"
                                >Appendix No. 73, pp. 112–114.</seg><seg type="margin">Appendix No.

                        <p>It is true he also denied the straits of Haro to be the channel of the
                            treaty, using these words:</p>
                        <p>The Earl of Aberdeen, in his final instructions, dated 18th May, 1846,
                            says nothing whatever about the Canal de Haro, but, on the contrary,
                            desires that the line might be drawn “in a southerly *direction through
                            the center of King George’s Sound and the Straits of Fuca to the Pacific
                                Ocean.”<seg type="margin">[35]</seg></p>
                        <p>Now why was Sir Richard Pakenham introduced to give testimony as to the
                            instruction which he received from Lord Aberdeen? The instruction itself
                            was in the Foreign Office, and was the best authority on the subject,
                            and would have given the whole truth. Sir Richard Pakenham in his
                            testimony leaves out the most important words of his final instructions.
                            Lord Aberdeen, it is true, did not name in them the channel of Haro by
                            name, but so far from writing anything to “the contrary,” he defined it
                            exactly, when, in those same “final instructions,” he describes the
                            channel of the treaty as the channel “leaving the whole of Vancouver
                            Island, with its ports and harbors, in the possession of Great
                                Britain.”<seg type="margin">Appendix to Memorial No. 43, p. 50, 1.
                                5, 7.</seg></p>
                        <p>The final interpretation of the treaty by Sir Richard Pakenham runs as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>The conditions of the treaty, according to their liberal tenor, would
                            require the line to be traced along the middle of the channel, meaning,
                            I presume, the whole intervening space which separates the continent
                            from Vancouver Island.</p>
                        <p>Thus Mr. Pakenham, the British signer of the treaty, adopting the theory
                            first communicated to the United States by Captain Prevost eleven years
                            after the treaty was ratified, rejects entirely the channel of the
                            so-called Rosario as the channel of the treaty. The question now is not
                            between the so-called Rosario and some channel intermediate between it
                            and that of Haro. It is whether the claims of the United States to the
                            Haro, or those of Great Britain to the so-called Rosario, are more in
                            accordance with the true interpretation of the treaty. The instructions
                            to Captain Prevost show that the British Government had no confidence in
                            the so-called Rosario as being the treaty channel; the <pb n="141"
                                xml:id="pg_141" facs="0171"/>testimony of Sir Richard Pakenham is
                            that the British government at the time of negotiating the treaty did
                            not intend the so-called Rosario *as the channel, while the words which
                            he suppressed from Lord Aberdeen’s final instructions prove the channel
                            of the treaty to be the canal de Haro. Adopting the theory of Captain
                            Prevost and Sir Richard Pakenham, Lord John Russell somewhat
                            peremptorily demanded of the United States the acceptance of that
                            theory, and in an instruction which the British minister at Washington
                            was directed to communicate to the United States, he wrote:<seg
                                type="margin">[36]</seg></p>
                        <p>The adoption of the central channel would give to Great Britain the
                            island of San Juan, which is believed to be of little or no value to the
                            United States, while much importance is attached by British colonial
                            authorities, and by Her Majesty’s government, to its retention as a
                            dependency of the colony of Vancouver’s Island.<seg type="margin"
                                >Appendix No. 73, p. 112.</seg></p>
                        <p>Her Majesty’s Government must, therefore, under any circumstances,
                            maintain the right of the British Crown to the island of San Juan. The
                            interests at stake in connection with the retention of that island are
                            too important to admit of compromise, and your lordship will
                            consequently bear in mind that whatever arrangement as to the boundary
                            line is finally arrived at, no settlement of the question will be
                            accepted by Her Majesty’s government which does not provide for the
                            island of San Juan being reserved for the British Crown.</p>
                        <p>To this naked and even menacing demand the American Government made the
                            only fitting reply; and certainly the Imperial Arbitrator will not give
                            an award to Great Britain, because the Vancouver colonial authorities
                            and Her Majesty’s Government covet the possession of San Juan.</p>
                        <p>When the attention of the British Secretary of State was called to the
                            absoluteness and to the motives of this communication, he answered:<seg
                                type="margin">Appendix No. 75 p. 117, 1. 17–22.</seg></p>
                        <p>Her Majesty’s Government were by implication abandoning a large part of
                            the territory they had claimed, and were merely insisting on the
                            retention of an island which, from the peculiarity of *its situation, it
                            was impossible for Her Majesty’s Government to cede, without
                            compromising interests of the gravest importance.<seg type="margin"
                                >[37]</seg></p>
                        <p>Lord John Russell acknowledged the necessity of supporting his pre
                            tensions by bringing them into agreement with the words 0f the treaty;
                            and therefore, giving up the channel of the so-called Rosario, he
                            entered into an argument in favor of the channel called on the United
                            States Coast Survey “the San Juan Channel,” on the British Admiralty
                            chart “Douglas Channel,” as the channel of the treaty.<seg type="margin"
                                >Appendix No 75,. p. 118, 1. 4–22.</seg></p>
                        <p>In other words, he interpreted the treaty simply as giving the island of
                            San Juan to the British, by which they would gain the exclusive
                            possession of the Haro channel.</p>
                        <p>A conclusion is thus made very easy. Captain Prevost, Sir Richard
                            Pakenham, and Lord John Russell unite in renouncing any treaty right to
                            the so-called Rosario channel, and unite in the opinion that the Douglas
                            Channel has a belter right to be regarded as the channel of the treaty
                            than the so-called Rosario. There is no escape from this cumulated
                            evidence thus furnished by the British Government: first, in the
                            instructions of Lord Aberdeen to Mr. Pakenham; second, in Mr. Pakenham’s
                            declaration of the meaning of the British Government at the time the
                            treaty was negotiated; third, in the instructions to Captain Prevost;
                            and fourth, in the statements of Lord John Russell, that the so-called
                            Rosario strait was not the channel through which, in the interpretation
                            of the British Government, the boundary line was to be run. It further
                            shows that up to the date of the instructions to Captain <pb n="142"
                                xml:id="pg_142" facs="0172"/>Prevost in 1856, the British Government
                            had never suggested any other than the Haro and the so-called Rosario
                            channel. Their own evidence, excluding the Rosario straits from their
                            contemplation at the date of the treaty, leaves the Haro as the only
                            possible channel within the contemplation of either party, and the only
                            one in accordance with the true interpretation of the treaty.</p>
                        <p>* One more effort was made for the settlement of the question by the two
                            Governments. On the 15th day of March, 1871, the commissioners on the
                            part of the United States and the commissioners on the part of Great
                            Britain, in a conference at Washington took up the northwestern boundary
                            question, and when no agreement could be arrived at respecting the
                            proper interpretation of the treaty of June, 1846, the American
                            commissioners expressed their readiness to abrogate the whole of that
                            part of the treaty of 1846, and re-arrange the boundary line which was
                            in dispute before that treaty was concluded. At the conference on the
                            20th of March, 1871, the British commissioners declined the
                                proposal.<seg type="margin">[38]</seg><seg type="margin">XXXVI.

                        <p>On the 19th of April the British commissioners, willing to renounce all
                            claim to the so-called Rosario, renewed the offer of the line which had
                            before been pressed by Captain Prevost, and maintained as the line of
                            the treaty by Sir Richard Pakenham and by Lord John Russell. The
                            American commissioners on the instant declined to entertain the
                            proposal, and the British commissioners could not consent to regard the
                            channel of Haro as the boundary, “except after a fair decision by an
                            impartial arbitrator.”</p>

                        <p>The United States have already asked Your Majesty’s attention to rules of
                            international law applicable to the interpretation of the treaty

                        <p>They agree with the British Government, that “the words of a treaty are
                            to be taken to be used in the sense in which they were commonly used at
                            the time when the treaty was entered into,” and ask Your Majesty to
                            interpret the words “Fuca’s straits” according to the usage established
                            by all the maps and reports prior to 1846.<seg type="margin">British

                            rather than an odious sense;” but they did not in their Memorial invoke
                            this rule, though it so decisively confirms their rights, because they
                            had no fear that the German Emperor could give to the convention an
                            odious interpretation. Since, however, this rule of interpretation has
                            been brought forward by the government of Her Britannic Majesty, the
                            United States must explain the immeasurably odious nature of the
                            interpretation which the British government desires Your Majesty to
                                adopt.<seg type="margin">[39]</seg><seg type="margin">British Case,

                        <p>The United States, in signing the treaty of 1846, had in view permanent
                            relations of amity with Great Britain, and therefore dealt with it
                            generously in the treaty, that there might remain to that power no
                            motive for discontent or cupidity. When they consented that Great
                            Britain should hold the southern cape of Vancouver Island, they knew
                            that the harbor of that cape was the very best on the Pacific, from San
                            Francisco to the far north. The United States took also into
                            consideration that Great Britain needed to share, and had a right to
                            expect to share in the best line of communication with its possessions
                            to the north.</p>
                        <p>A ship using the so-called Rosario strait may be exposed to cannon-shot,
                                <pb n="143" xml:id="pg_143" facs="0173"/>not only as it enters that
                            strait, but nearly all the way as it sails through it. One British
                            Ministry after another has shown that it set no value upon it whatever,
                            and has represented that it was not contemplated by treaty as a
                            boundary, and has used the claim to it only as a means of driving the
                            United States into a surrender of the island of San Juan.</p>
                        <p>A ship, as both parties agree, can enter the channel of Haro and not be
                            under any necessity of passing within territorial waters on either side
                            of the central line.</p>
                        <p>This passage by the Haro channel to the British possessions north of 49°,
                            is the shortest, the most convenient, *the best, and the only perfectly
                            safe one, alike in peace and in war. Of this channel, the United States
                            by the treaty of 1846 concede the joint possession to the British, but
                            they concede it with circumstances of peculiar generosity, or rather
                            magnanimity. In passing from the lower part of the Haro channel to the
                            upper interior waters, they allow to Great Britain equal rights with
                            themselves to pass through the Haro channel to the true Rosario of the
                            Spaniards, the British gulf of Georgia. Thus far the United States
                            reserve to themselves no advantage over the English. They go farther.
                            There are two other channels connecting the straits of Haro with the
                            upper waters; one of them a little above 49°, at the Portier pass; the
                            other below 49°, through Swanson channel and Active pass. As to both of
                            these, the United States leave to the British the exclusive possession
                            of the islands on each side. This is a great concession, far outweighing
                            in value any advantage the Americans may gain in the so-called Rosario
                            straits. The regular track of the British steamers between south
                            Vancouver and Fraser’s river is through the channel of Swanson and
                            Active pass, a wide, sheltered channel, to them the shortest and most
                            convenient, never freezing in winter, with water nowhere less than
                            ninety feet deep, as easy of navigation as any part of the broadest and
                            most magnificent river in Europe.<seg type="margin">[40]</seg><seg
                                type="margin">Map O.</seg></p>
                        <p>To keep all these advantages and to acquire exclusive possession of the
                            channel of Haro became the uncontrollable desire, first of the Hudson’s
                            Bay Company, then of the politicians of Vancouver Island. The conduct of
                            the United States merited a better requital.</p>
                        <p>The demand of the government of Her Britannic Majesty is as contrary to
                            every principle of convenience, equity, and comity, as it is to the
                            intention and the language of the treaty of 1846. To ask the United
                            States to give up their equal right in the canal de Haro is to ask them
                            to shut themselves out of their own house. They own the continent *east
                            of these waters to the lake of the Woods, a distance of 28° of
                            longitude. Is it within the bounds of belief that they should have given
                            up to Great Britain the exclusive possession of the best channel, and
                            the only safe channel, by which they could approach their own vast
                            dominions on the north? Grant the English demand, draw the line of
                            boundary through the so-called Rosario channel, and the Americans would
                            have access to their own immense territory from the Pacific, only by the
                            good will of the English. Such an interpretation of the treaty is so
                            unequal, so partial to Great Britain, so opposite to the natural rights
                            of the United States, so inconsistent with the words of the treaty, that
                            the American Government holds itself deeply aggrieved by the British
                            persistence in demanding an interpretation in so “odious a sense.”<seg
                                type="margin">[41]</seg></p>
                        <p>The United States, it may once more be said, had not the intention to
                            present the subject in this light to the Imperial Arbitrator, for they
                                <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144" facs="0174"/>confide entirely in his
                            justice. But since Her Majesty’s government apparently assumes that an
                            award in favor of the American Government would be “odious,” the United
                            States must not neglect to invite attention to the true aspect of the
                            case.</p>
                        <p>The American Government is the more surprised at this manner of
                            presenting the subject by the government of Her Britannic Majesty,
                            inasmuch as Captain Prevost, after months employed in exploring the
                            waters, conceded that the British claim to the so-called Rosario Strait
                            “could not be substantiated,” and this opinion was formally adopted by
                            Sir Richard Pakenham and by Lord John Russell; the latter of whom
                            himself declares that he abandoned by implication all but the island of
                            San Juan.</p>
                        <p>Another reason why an award in favor of the so-called Rosario as the
                            channel would be odious, is, that it would transfer to the foreign
                            allegiance of Great Britain, islands east of San Juan which have long
                            been and are now in the undisputed posses*sion of the United States. The
                            United States have likewise been virtually in possession of the island
                            of San Juan; though each party maintains in it a small garrison. The
                            civil population on that island is thoroughly American. Out of
                            ninety-six resident males of twenty-one years of age and upward, the
                            number of American citizens is fifty-six; the number of those born in
                            Great Britain and Ireland is but twenty-six. Of both sexes and all ages,
                            there are one hundred and seventy-nine Americans and but fifty-two of
                            British nationality on the island of San Juan. In the whole archipelago,
                            the American population numbers three hundred and fourteen, the British
                            but ninety. How unsuitable it would be, then, to assign to Great Britain
                            islands which have never been out of the possession of the United
                            States, and which are occupied almost exclusively by their citizens!<seg

                        <p>The United States do not understand how a controversy could have arisen
                            on the meaning of the boundary treaty of June 15, 1846. It will be
                            remembered that it was they who, in the administration of Sir Robert
                            Peel, recalled the intimation of Mr. Huskisson in 1826, and suggested
                            that the disputed boundary might be arranged by just so much deflection
                            from the forty-ninth parallel, as would leave the whole of Vancouver
                            island to Great Britain. For more than two years, through two successive
                            envoys, they continued to propose this settlement. At length Lord
                            Aberdeen consented to it. The language of the treaty for carrying out
                            the arrangement came from him. The United States accepted it in the
                            sense in which they had suggested it; and by all rules for the equitable
                            construction of contracts, Great Britain ought not now o attach to it a
                            sense different from that in which Lord Aberdeen must have known that
                            the United States accepted it. Moreover, before the treaty of June,
                            1846, was signed, Lord Aberdeen, well knowing by the experience of more
                            than two years that the United States had proposed as their
                            ultimatissimum, not to divide Vancouver island, instructed the British
                            minister at Washington, that what England *was to obtain was the channel
                            “leaving the whole of Vancouver’s island in the possession of Great
                            Britain.” Thus both parties had the same object in view; both parties
                            intended the same thing and expressed in writing their intentions before
                            the treaty was signed. The Government of the United States of that day
                            assented to the treaty of 1846, with the understanding, communicated in
                            advance to the British Government, that the boundary line was to deflect
                            from the forty-ninth parallel for the sole purpose of giving the south
                            of Vancouver Island to Great Britain, so that it was necessarily to <pb
                                n="145" xml:id="pg_145" facs="0175"/>pass through the canal de Haro.
                            The American Senate accepted it in that sense, and only in that sense.
                            After it had been accepted, and before the ratifications were exchanged,
                            Sir Robert Peel in the House of Commons announced in memorable words,
                            that Her Majesty’s government had made the contract in the same sense.
                            Not long afterwards the present agent of the United States in this
                            arbitration, then the plenipotentiary of the United States near the
                            Court of St. James, officially called the official attention of Lord
                            Palmerston to this construction; and from Lord Palmerston, then the
                            British Secretary of Foreign Affairs, who, on the 29th of June, 1846,
                            had, as a member of the House of Commons, listened to Sir Robert Peel’s
                            interpretation of the treaty, and, with the knowledge of this
                            interpretation, had on the same evening welcomed it as honorable to both
                            countries, the note of the American plenipotentiary received the
                            acquiescence of silence.<seg type="margin">Appendix to Memorial No. 10

                        <p>The broad and deep channel of Haro, in its ceaseless ebb and flow, is the
                            ever faithful and unimpeachable interpreter of the treaty. Time out of
                            mind, it formed the pathway for the canoe fleets of the Red Men. It is
                            the first channel discovered by Anglo-Americans or Europeans within the
                            strait of Fuca; it is the first that was explored and surveyed from side
                            to side; it is the first through which Europeans sailed from the Fuca
                            Strait to the waters above the parallel *of 49. And now, in the increase
                            of emigration and trade, it approves itself as “the channel” of commerce
                            by the unanimous choice of the ships of all nations.<seg type="margin"
                                >[44]</seg></p>
                        <p>Everything favors a peaceful adjudication. The influential and active
                            Hudson’s Bay Company has ceased to exist. The United States have paid
                            them, and all other British companies or citizens, for their possessory
                            rights large indemnities, which they themselves and the British
                            government acknowledge to be most ample. The generation of Britons who
                            reluctantly assumed the unwelcome task of keeping the fruitful region of
                            Northwest America in a wilderness condition, has passed away. Under the
                            genial influence of the United States, cities rise on the stations of
                            fur-traders, and agriculture supersedes hunting and trapping. This
                            condition of the country facilitates the final recognition of the rights
                            of the United States, and encourages the belief that an award favorable
                            to them will be accepted without an emotion of surprise or
                            discontent.</p>

                        <p>While in the Navy Department I caused a traced copy of Wilkes’s chart of
                            the Straits of Haro to be made. If not needed in the Navy Department I
                            request that the President will direct it to be sent to this Legation.
                            It is intimated to me that questions may arise with regard to the
                            islands east of that strait. I ask your authority to meet any such claim

                            your dispatch No. 1, [November 3,] the traced copy of Wilkes’s chart of
                            the Straits of Haro. This will enable you to act understandingly *upon
                            any question which may hereafter arise between the two governments in
                            respect to the sovereignty of the islands situate between the continent
                            and Vancouver’s Island. It is not probable, however, that any claim of
                            this character will be seriously preferred on the part of Her Britannic
                            Majesty’s government to any island lying to the eastward of the Canal of
                            Arro, as marked in Captain Wilkes’s “Map of the Oregon Territory.” This,
                            I have no doubt, is the channel which Lord Aberdeen had in view, when,
                            in a conversation with Mr. MacLane, about the middle of May last, on the

                            of the Oregon question, his lordship explained the character of the
                            proposition he intended to submit through Mr. Pakenham. As understood by
                            Mr. MacLane, and by him communicated to this department in <pb n="148"

                                called to the probable wishes of the Hudson’s Bay Company to get
                                some of the islands on our side of the line in the Straits of Fuca.
                                I speak only from my own judgment and inductions from what I observe
                                and hear; but it would not surprise me if a formal proposition
                                should soon be made on the part of the British Government to run the
                                line between the two countries at the west from the point where it
                                first meets the water through the straits to the Pacific Ocean.<seg

                                properly ours. The ministry, I believe, has no such design. Some of
                                its members would be the first to frown on it. But I am not so well
                                assured that the Hudson’s Bay Company is equally reasonable, or that
                                on the British side a boundary commissioner might not be appointed
                                favoring the encroaching propensities of that company. * *<seg

                        <p>The Hudson’s Bay Company have been trying to get a grant of Vancouver’s
                            Island. I inquired, from mere curiosity, about it. Lord Palmerston
                            replied that it was an affair that belonged exclusively to the Colonial
                            Office, and he did not know the intentions of Lord Grey. He then told
                            me, what I had not known before, that he had made a proposition at
                            Washington for marking the boundaries in the northwest by setting up a
                            landmark on the point of land where the forty-ninth parallel touches the
                            sea, and for ascertaining the division line in the channel by noting the
                            bearings of certain objects. I observed that on the main-land a few
                            simple astronomical <pb n="149" xml:id="pg_149" facs="0179"
                            />observations were all that were requisite; that the water in the
                            channel of Haro did not require to be divided, since the navigation was
                            free to both parties; though, of course, the islands east of the center
                            of the channel of Haro were ours. He had no good chart of the Oregon
                            waters, and asked me to let him see the traced copy of Wilkes’s chart.
                            He spoke of the propriety of settling definitively the ownership of the
                            several islands, in order that settlements might not be begun by one
                            party on what properly belongs to the other. On returning home I sent
                            him my traced copy of Wilkes’s chart, with a note, of which I inclose a

                            recently published by James Wyld, geographer to the Queen. It purports
                            to mark, by a dotted line, the boundary between the United States and
                            Great Britain. You will see that this map suggests an encroachment on
                            our rights by adopting a line far to the east of the Straits of Haro.
                            You may remember that Mr. Boyd, more than two years ago, suggested to
                            you that a design of preferring some such claims existed. I inferred,
                            from what I could learn at that time, that this design grew up with the
                            Hudson’s Bay Company, and I had no reason to suppose it favored by the
                            Colonial Secretary. * * *<seg type="margin">Mr. Bancroft continues the

                        <p>I was in the administration of Mr. Polk at the time when Mr. Buchanan
                            perfected the treaty for settling the boundary of Oregon. The basis of
                            the settlement was the parallel of 49°, with the concession to Britain
                            of that part of Vancouver’s Island which lies south of 49°. The United
                            States held that both parties had a right to the free navigation of the
                            waters round Vancouver’s Island, and therefore consented that the
                            British boundary should extend to the center of the Channel of Haro.
                            Such was the understanding of everybody at the time of consummating the
                            treaty in England and at Washington. The Hudson’s Bay Company may
                            naturally enough covet the group of <pb n="151" xml:id="pg_151"
                                facs="0181"/>islands east of that channel, but the desire, which
                            never can amount to a claim, should not be listened to for a moment.</p>
                        <p>While I was in England no minister was preposterous enough to lend the
                            authority of the British government to the cupidity of the Hudson’s Bay
                            Company in this particular. I think you must find in the Department of
                            State a copy of a very short letter of mine to Lord Palmerston,
                            inclosing him a chart of those waters as drawn by our own Coast Survey.
                            I think in that letter I mentioned the center of the Straits of Haro as
                            the boundary. That chart would show by the depths of the soundings that
                            the Straits of Haro are the channel intended in the treaty, even if
                            there had not been a distinct understanding on the part of the British
                            government as well as the American at the time of the signing of the
                            treaty. Lord Palmerston, in his reply acknowledging the receipt of the
                            chart, made no pretense of adopting the wishes of the Hudson’s Bay
                            Company, and he never did so, even in conversation. I never had occasion
                            in England to make any peremptory statement on the subject, because
                            nothing was ever said or hinted there which required it; but whenever
                            conversation turned upon the subject, whether with Lord Palmerston or
                            with the Under Secretary of the Colonial Office, *I always spoke of the
                            Strait of Haro as undeniably the channel of the the treaty, and no
                            member of the British government ever took issue with me. In running the
                            line through the center of the Straits of Haro there may be one or two
                            small islands about which a question might be raised, but as to the
                            important group that the Hudson’s Bay Company covet, the demand, if
                            made, should be met at the outset as one too preposterous to be
                            entertained as a question.<seg type="margin">[65]</seg></p>

                        <p>In answer to the memorandum on the Haro question, I have to state that I
                            have a full knowledge of the Islands and waters lying between the
                            Straits of Fuca and the Gulf of Georgia, having surveyed the whole
                            whilst I was in command of the United States exploring expedition, and I
                            state of my own knowledge that the Canal de Haro is the best and
                            shortest route bet ween the same. The depth of water is very great and
                            all obstructions to the navigation of the Canal de Haro are visible.
                            Indeed it may be said to be an arm of the sea passing from the Straits
                            of Fuca to the Gulf of Georgia and separating the Island of Vancouver
                            from the main or continent of America, comprising now the Territory of
                            Washington, and it is the natural communication between the Gulf of
                            Georgia and Fuca Straits, leading or trending north and south, and has
                            now become the great highway of commerce, between Victoria, on the
                            Island of Vancouver, and the Fraser’s river, a few miles north of the

                            Northwest British America. The strait of Haro may be navigated at all
                            times, day or night, with perfect <pb n="152" xml:id="pg_152"
                                facs="0182"/>safety, and nature has conferred upon it all that could
                            be desired to be a well-defined national highway, between the island of
                            Vancouver and the smaller and intricate passages through the small
                            archipelago lying on its eastern side, which all are more or less
                            intricate, narrow in places to a few hundred yards, and with very rapid
                            tides. One of these passages *lying on the east of this small
                            archipelago was named by me as Ringgold Channel, but at times called the
                            Rosario Strait; its width does not entitle it to the name of a strait,
                            and with its many and dangerous islets, rocks, and shoals, it is a very
                            unsafe and difficult channel to navigate even in the day time, and
                            impossible with any assurance of safety in the night time. It cannot be
                            compared with the Strait of Haro in any point of view, and can only be
                            used by small vessels seeking anchorage in the event of disaster, and
                            bad or boisterous weather. While the Strait of Haro affords like
                            facilities for anchorage under the islands on the east side, it may be
                            safely navigated, and affords ample protection in its sea-room for the
                            largest class of vessels.<seg type="margin">Rear-Admiral Wilkes on the

                        <p>The Strait of Haro, though known at the time of my survey in 1841, it was
                            not visited, as there were no vessels engaged in those waters, except
                            the small and very inefficient steamer called, the Beaver, commanded by
                            Captain McNeil, who spoke of it to me as the best passage, although he
                            was obliged to pass through the Rosario passage on account of the
                            necessity of seeking the small coves at night in passing along the east
                            shore towards Fraser’s river to supply the Post of the Hudson’s Bay
                            Company, and this was only achieved twice a year.</p>
                        <p>All the vessels now engaged in the trade from Victoria to Fraser’s river
                            and the Gulf of Georgia, invariably pass through the Haro Straits, which
                            verifies my opinion when I first surveyed it that it would become the
                            great and only highway between the Straits of Fuca and the Gulf of
                            Georgia, and such it has now become. I consider that in the treaty
                            between the British government and the United States there is no other
                            passage that could be considered as adapted to the terms of the treaty,
                            and both parties to that instrument must have been of like views in
                            relation to it. All the charts used as information show the same broad
                            channel and superiority of the Gulf of Haro over any other line to the
                            sea, and there can scarcely be a doubt that it was so understood by the
                            Commissioners of both sides.</p>

                            the United States expedition commanded by Lieutenant Charles Wilkes, and
                            one of the surveying party in July, 1841, which surveyed the canal de
                            Haro, the main ship-channel for vessels bound from the sea northward
                            inside of Vancouver’s Island, for the Strait of Georgia, Fraser’s River,

                        <p>The canal is deep, clear, and navigable for vessels of all sizes or

                        <p>While we were engaged in the survey of the Straits of Juan de Fuca and
                            its adjacent waters, the only vessel then navigating them was the Hudson
                            Bay Company’s steamer Beaver, which was employed by it supplying stores
                            to, and collecting peltry from, its trading-ports on the coast, and
                            which, I am of the opinion, used either the canal de Haro, or Straits of
                            Rosario channels according as to where she was coming from and bound

                        <p>When coming from the sea and bound north for the straits of Georgia,

                            Island, the main ship-channel is the Canal de Haro, it being the nearest
                            and most direct. But when coasting along the main-land and bound north,
                            from any of the ports in Puget’s sound, Hood’s canal, &amp;c., for the
                            strait of Georgia, Fraser’s River, &amp;c., the straits of Rosario would
                            be the nearest and most direct. * * * * * * *</p>

                        <p>The superior depth and width of the Canal de Haro are fully exhibited not
                            only on Wilkes’s Charts, but on those of our own Coast Survey, and I
                            presume on those of the British Commission *on the boundary. It would be
                            therefore useless to add any merely verbal statement as to that fact.
                            The reason for Vancouver’s not surveying it was, that his object being
                            to find a passage to the eastward, he hugged the main shore on returning
                            from the examination of Admiralty Inlet and Puget’s Sound, and thus went
                            northward through what is now called Rosario Strait; but that it was
                            known to him from the charts of Quadra is evident from his having laid
                            it down on his chart by the name of the canal de “Arro,” and his
                            delineation of the whole group of the disputed islands. The reason that
                            Governor Simpson, in his voyage from Nisqually to Sitka, (Overland
                            Journey Round the World, during the years 1841 and 1842, by Sir George
                            Simpson,) took the same passage, was doubtless because, however
                            roundabout from the Strait of Fuca, it is the most direct from Admiralty
                            Inlet. The pretense that the Hudson Bay Company was unaware of the
                            existence of the Canal de Haro is as absurd as it would be, were the
                            inhabitants of Brooklyn to ignore the passage between Long and Staten
                            Islands, and claim the Kill von Kull as the outlet of the Sound and
                            Hudson River to the sea. * * *<seg type="margin">Statement of Mr. George

                        <p>It appears from Mr. R. M. Martin’s work on “The Hudson’s Bay Territories
                            and Vancouver Island, London, 1849,” page 35, that “the Chief Factor”
                            [since Governor Sir James Douglas] “surveyed the south coast of
                            Vancouver’s Island in 1842, and, after a careful survey, fixed on the
                            port of Camosack” [now Victoria] “as the most eligible site for the
                            Hudson’s Bay Company’s factory within the Straits of de “Fuca;” and
                            further, Mr. Douglas, after investigating the south coast of the Island,
                            says, “Camosack is a pleasant and convenient site for the establishment,
                                <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154" facs="0184"/>within fifty yards of the
                            anchorage, on the border of a large tract of clear land, which extends
                            eastward to Point Gonzalez at the southeast end of the island,” &amp;c.
                            Ho man who knows Governor Douglas will charge him with stupidity,
                            negligence, or want of knowledge of his own interests, and it is drawing
                            too much on human credulity to suppose that his examinations did not
                            lead to a knowledge of the strait, if he was not aware of it before. At
                            any rate the Indians who frequented the new trading-post, coming not
                            only from the Gulf of Georgia, Johnston’s Straits, and the northern end
                            of Vancouver Island, but from Queen Charlotte’s Islands and the whole
                            northwest coast as far as the Russian possessions, knew and pursued the
                            passage of the Canal de Haro and that only, and do so still.</p>
                        <p>*With regard to the channel actually in use at present, I can positively
                            state that the Rosario Strait is not followed at present at all, by
                            vessels of the Hudson’s Bay Company; nor is the Strait of Haro in its
                            entire length. Vessels bound northward from Victoria follow the latter
                            as far as Stuart Island, and thence take the channel between Salt Spring
                            Island on the east and the Saturna group on the west, going out into the
                            Gulf of Georgia by Active Passage, between that group and Galiano
                            Island, thus cutting off the detour round Java Head, and taking an
                            almost straight line from the southern entrance of the Canal de Haro to
                            the middle of the Gulf of Georgia on the forty-ninth parallel, and to
                            the mouth of Fraser river. This interior passage is perfectly navigable
                            for large vessels, as in fact it is beyond the forty-ninth parallel,
                            Captain Prevost himself having gone through Virago passage in Her
                            Britannic Majesty’s ship of that name long before the Boundary
                            Commission was organized.<seg type="margin">[69]</seg></p>
                        <p>There seems to exist a general misapprehension of the amount of trade
                            carried on by the Hudson’s Bay Company’s or other British vessels on
                            these waters. Prior to the treaty of 1846, Fort Vancouver, on the
                            Columbia river, was the great depot for the receipt and distribution of
                            goods for the northwest coast, as well as the interior, and the annual
                            ship from London delivered its cargo there. All furs were likewise
                            received and packed there for transportation. Fort Langley, on Fraser
                            River, was the nearest post of any magnitude. Fort Nisqually, on Puget’s
                            Sound, belonged to the Puget’s Sound Agricultural Company, and according
                            to the testimony in the case of the Hudson’s Bay and Puget’s Sound
                            Agricultural Companies’ Claims, the goods received there were purchased
                            of and accounted for to the Hudson’s Bay Company. It never was a
                            distributing post of the latter. * * * * *</p>

                        <p>A map should be examined showing the relative position of the Hudson Bay
                            Company’s establishment at Victoria on Van*couver’s Island, Nisqually on
                            Puget Sound, and Fort Langley on Fraser River, and <pb n="155"

                            Rosario Straits as avenues of communication between the three points. It
                            would be well also to consider the relative importance of these three
                            establishments in those waters.<seg type="margin">Why the vessels of the

                        <p>It is not at all probable that any vessel from foreign parts or from the
                            Columbia River ever did communicate directly with Fort Langley (on
                            Fraser River) without touching at the other posts on the lower waters,
                            Victoria and Nisqually. It is well known, on the contrary, that these
                            trips of the Hudson’s Bay Company’s vessels were made periodically for
                            the purpose of distributing the regular supplies of food and merchandise
                            for trading purposes, and receiving in return the furs collected at the
                            several posts. Now, by referring to the map, it will be seen that a
                            vessel leaving the Columbia River for the foregoing purpose would first
                            touch at Victoria, then at Nisqually, and then at Fort Langley on Fraser
                            River. In making this trip no navigator would dream of taking the Canal
                            de Haro in sailing from Nisqually to Fort Langley, when the more direct
                            and much shorter route lay through Rosario Straits. * * Although Rosario
                            Strait was generally used, (and good reasons have been given herein for
                            this general use,) the Canal de Haro was not only known by these very
                            Hudson Bay Company’s employés to be navigable, but by their own
                            affidavits it is shown that two of their own vessels made successful
                            passages through this channel prior to the date of the treaty. * * * * *

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In compliance with your request that I
                            would furnish you with any information which I may possess with regard
                            to the navigation of Rosario Straits by British and other vessels
                            previous to 1846, and whether this or the canal de Haro was the channel
                            most frequently used up to that period and since, these being the
                            channels now in dispute as to which is the true boundary line on the
                            northwest coast between the United States and Great Britain, I have the
                            honor to make the following statement, prefacing it with a brief account
                            of my opportunities for acquiring this information, and the sources from
                            which it was derived.</p>
                        <p>I was a resident of Washington Territory from 1853 to 1860. I was for
                            several terms a member of the territorial legislature and *in the
                            discharge of my official duties had occasion to thoroughly investigate
                            the subject of the claims of the Hudson Bay Company, and its branch
                            organization, the Puget Sound Agricultural Company, which foreign
                            corporations at that time, and for several years afterward, retained
                            their trading-posts and establishments in different portions of the
                            territory. This was a source of much complaint, as they claimed large
                            tracts of unoccupied land, and thus materially interfered with the
                            settlement of the country.<seg type="margin">[72]</seg></p>
                        <p>The searching for the foundation of these extensive claims necessarily
                            involved the history of all the region west of the Rocky Mountains and
                            north of the Columbia River to the forty-ninth parallel.</p>
                        <p>My information, other than the facts of which I was personally cognizant
                            during my seven years’ residence, was derived from statements made me by
                            persons who had been in the country many years. Among these were the
                            earlier missionaries, both Protestant and Catholic, the first settlers,
                            old trappers, and, in many instances, the chief factors and traders of
                            the Hudson Bay Company. One of the topics of frequent conversation was
                            the early navigation of Puget Sound and the adjacent waters. I gleaned
                            from corroborating evidence the following facts. At the time of the
                            treaty of 1846, the vessels employed between Victoria, the trading-post
                            at Nisqually, near the head of the Sound, Fort Langley on Fraser River,
                            and the other posts on the northern coast, were the Hudson Bay Company
                            steamer Beaver and the schooner Cadboro. The company owned two or three
                            small brigs, which were principally used in the trade with California
                            and the Sandwich Islands. Each year two ships were dispatched from
                            England, bringing out trading goods and other supplies and returning
                            with the furs collected at the depots of Victoria and Fort Vancouver, on
                            the Columbia River, from the various trading-posts on the coast and in
                            the interior, west of the Rocky Mountains. On the arrival of these ships
                            all of the posts, both of the interior and the coast, were fitted out
                            with what was estimated as a supply sufficient to answer for trading
                            purposes and the support of the employés for a year ahead.</p>
                        <p>The usual course for the two vessels especially assigned to this duty on
                            the sound and northern coast was in the spring of each year—which was
                            the time of the arrival and distribution—to take supplies up to
                            Nisqually for that post and the station at Cowlitz Plains, some fifty
                            miles south. The extensive farm at this *latter place was started for
                            the purpose of raising grain, potatoes, and other vegetables, for the
                            supply both of the northern posts and the Russian possessions at Sitka
                            and the Aleutian Islands. For their bread stuffs the Russian-Americans
                            were entirely dependent upon this farm, and the <pb n="157"
                                xml:id="pg_157" facs="0187"/>Puget Sound Agricultural Company had
                            therefore with them a large and lucrative trade. At Nisqually were large
                            herds of cattle, which were slaughtered as required and salted down.
                            These provisions were taken on board the Beaver and Cadboro, and, with
                            the other supplies, delivered at the posts on Fraser River and up the
                                coast.<seg type="margin">[73]</seg></p>
                        <p>Coming down from Nisqually, the masters of the vessels naturally, in
                            their trips to Fraser River, turned into Rosario Straits. From up the
                            sound it was the first channel which led off to the north.</p>
                        <p>I have mentioned this customary manner of delivering the annual supplies,
                            because it is the principal reason why the Rosario Straits at that time
                            was generally used by the fur company’s vessels. Another cause may be
                            found in the fact that the canal de Haro is a broad, deep arm of the
                            sea, being, in fact, but a continuation of the straits of Fuca, sweeping
                            in with a rushing tide, and meeting the waters of the Gulf of Georgia at
                            its northern end. Its extreme depth made it difficult to find good
                                anchorage.<seg type="margin">Why the so-called Rosario Strait was
                                used.</seg></p>
                        <p>Rosario Straits is a very much narrower channel. It is not comparatively
                            deep, is well sheltered, and affords everywhere secure anchorage. Of
                            late years it has been found to be dangerous for large ships on account
                            of sunken rocks, but the vessels then navigating it were small, and
                            therefore of light draught, and ran little or no risk on that
                            account.</p>
                        <p>The statement that the canal de Haro is a channel but recently known is
                            absurd. The steamer Beaver went through it years before the treaty, and
                            that the schooner Cadboro did so is established by the fact that one of
                            the passages leading into the canal de Haro is known by the name of the
                            Cadboro Pass. All the northern Indians who came to Victoria to trade
                            passed through the canal de Haro, as did also the Indians from Fraser

                            In 1853 Admiral (then Lieutenant) Alden passed through the canal de Haro
                            in the United States Coast-Survey steamer Active. Governor Douglas, of
                            Vancouver’s Island, gave him much valuable information concerning it,
                            and evinced a thorough and complete* knowledge of its tides and depth of
                            water. Douglas was the governor by virtue of being the senior chief
                            factor of the Hudson Bay Company. He had selected the site and
                            established the post at Victoria in 1842. A man of great energy, he made
                            himself acquainted with everything relating to the interests of the
                            company he represented, and this involved not only a knowledge of the
                            fur-trade and the character of the Indians, but also that of the
                            surrounding country and its adjacent waters.<seg type="margin">The canal

                        <p>In the spring of 1854, on a visit to Victoria, I was a witness to the
                            fact that Canal de Haro was the channel used by the English vessels. At
                            that time quite a considerable trade had sprung up with Nanaimo, in
                            consequence of the working of the extensive coal-mines at that place,
                            which is on the eastern side of Vancouver’s Island, near the fiftieth
                            parallel. I was standing, with several other persons, watching a large
                            bark, which had just left the harbor, and under full sail was heading up
                            the passage, when one of the party, an old Hudson Bay Company ship
                            master, remarked, “If the breeze holds she will go through Haro straits
                            flying; but if it fails, she will drift a long way before finding
                            anchorage. The channel is so broad and the straits so deep that it is
                            like being out at sea.”<seg type="margin">Canal de Haro the passage to
                                the north.</seg></p>
                        <p>From 1854 to 1860, I was frequently at Vancouver’s Island, and know
                            personally that Canal de Haro was the usual route to Fraser river, the
                            Nanaimo coal-mines, and the saw-mills at Burrard’s Inlet.</p>
                        <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158" facs="0188"/>
                        <p>In 1857, the British steam corvette “Satellite” and the surveying steamer
                            Plumper arrived at Vancouver’s Island. Captains Prevost and Richards,
                            commanding these vessels, were the British commissioners to settle the
                            boundary line. When they went to Nanaimo for coal, they passed through
                            Canal de Haro.</p>
                        <p>In 1858 occurred what is known as the Fraser river excitement, consequent
                            upon the discovery of gold in that river and its tributaries. During
                            that year I made frequent visits to Victoria, and was also up Fraser
                            river. Victoria was the disembarking point for the ocean steamers from
                            San Francisco. Steamers to be used between Victoria and Fraser river
                            were brought up from California; others were hastily built on the sound
                            for that purpose; some of these smaller steamers also plied between the
                            American towns and the river. In the great rush of gold miners, the
                            steamers, though crowded to their utmost capacity, could not convey all
                            seeking *passage. Every other means therefore of water conveyance was in
                            addition brought into service—schooners, sloops, boats, and canoes. The
                            route at first adopted was entirely through the canal de Haro, but the
                            steamers eventually went by a still nearer passage. After going part of
                            the way up the canal de Haro, they turned into the channel on the
                            western side of Saturna island, passing into the Gulf of Georgia by what
                            is known as the “Active pass.”<seg type="margin">[75]</seg></p>
                        <p>In 1859, I was for several months on San Juan island, and frequently saw
                            the steamers and other vessels passing between Victoria and Fraser
                            river. The canal de Haro and the nearer route inside of Saturna island
                            were the only routes used; nor did I ever see or hear of any steamer or
                            sailing-vessel during the gold excitement going from Victoria to Fraser
                            river by the way of Rosario straits. In the hurry of those stirring
                            times, the master of any vessel who took such a roundabout route to
                            reach his destination would have been not only severely ridiculed, but
                            in all probability would have lost his carrying trade, both of
                            passengers and of goods.</p>
                        <p>The “middle channel” which was proposed by Captain Prevost as a
                            compromise, at its entrance, between the islands of San Juan and Lopez,
                            is so narrow that it cannot be seen until you are quite near. A vessel
                            approaching it has to run in by the landmarks. It is but a few hundred
                            yards across, and is only used by vessels going into San Juan harbor,
                            which is on the inner side of the island, a short distance from the
                            entrance. The avowed object of this proposal was, to obtain San Juan
                            Island, the most valuable of the islands in the Archipelago. The channel
                            designated passes into the canal de Haro, near its northern end, and
                            would present the anomaly of the canal de Haro being adopted as the
                            boundary for a portion of its course in its direct passage to the ocean,
                            and then diverged from, thus conflicting with the clause in the Treaty
                            which expressly stipulates the course of the water-line shall be through
                            a continuous channel.<seg type="margin">Worthlessness of the middle
                                channel.</seg></p>
                        <p>The assertion that San Juan is essential for the protection of
                            Vancouver’s Island is as absurd as the pretended ignorance of the
                            navigability of the canal de Haro. The nearest portion of San Juan is
                            eighteen miles from the entrance to Victoria harbor, and owing to the
                            immense width of the channel, there is no point at which fortifications
                            could be established which could interfere with the passage of vessels
                            to the settlements of British Columbia.</p>
                        <p>*The canal de Haro is the only one of the channels which is over a
                            cannon-shot across. The difference in width and depth of water between
                            it and Rosario Straits is so great that it appears like contrasting an
                            inland sea with a river.<seg type="margin">[76]</seg><seg type="margin"

                            fallen into disuse, and the canal de Haro is now, and has been for many
                            years, the route exclusively used between Victoria and British
                            Columbia.</p>

                            first duly sworn, states as follows:<seg type="margin">Affidavits on the
                                canal de Haro.</seg></p>
                        <p>My age is thirty-seven years. My occupation that of merchant and shipping
                            agent. My place of residence is Victoria, Vancouver Island, and have
                            resided here most of the time since eighteen hundred and fifty-nine.</p>
                        <p>For the last ten years I have been agent for a line of sail-vessels
                            running between San Francisco and ports in British Columbia.</p>
                        <p>During all the time since eighteen hundred and fifty-nine, vessels, both
                            sail and steam, in making trips from Victoria to the Gulf of Georgia and
                            Fraser River, have invariably used the canal de Haro as a passage.</p>
                        <p>I have also heard masters of steamers and sail-vessels invariably speak
                            of the canal de Haro as the channel used by them, and of its
                            superiority, for purposes of navigation, over any other channel between
                            the continent and Vancouver Island.</p>
                        <p>All English steamers have used the canal de Haro as a passage in making
                            trips from Victoria to Fraser River, since my residence at this place,
                            and continue to do so at this time. American steamers have done the same
                            and do now. In fact the canal de Haro is the only channel used by steam
                            and sail vessels, at the present time, and has been the only one used
                            for years.</p>

                            My age is forty-nine years; and I have resided at Victoria, Vancouver
                            Island, since eighteen hundred and fifty-eight. My occupation is that of
                            merchant. I have been acquainted with the routes of travel by water
                            between Victoria and points on the Gulf of Georgia <pb n="161"
                                xml:id="pg_161" facs="0191"/>and Fraser River, since the year
                            eighteen hundred and fifty-eight. The canal de Haro has been the channel
                            used by steamers and sail-vessels, British and others, since eighteen
                            hundred and fifty-eight, and is the one now generally, if not
                            exclusively, used in making trips to and from the above-named points,
                            both night and day. It is in fact the main channel, and the only one
                            regarded as really safe by masters of steamers and sail-vessels, who are
                            acquainted with the waters between the continent and Vancouver
                            Island.</p>

                            Fraser river. No navigator would ever think of using any other channel,

                        <p>I, William J. Waitt, of the City of Olympia, County of Thurston, and
                            Territory aforesaid, do solemnly declare upon oath that I am *a master
                            mariner, of the age of thirty-two years; that I came to Victoria,
                            Vancouver’s Island, in the spring of 1868, and for the next four years
                            was engaged in steamboating between said City of Victoria and Fraser’s
                            River, in British Columbia; fifteen months of that period I was master,
                            the remainder pilot and mate. In 1862 I commenced running between
                            Victoria and Olympia, with occasional trips from Victoria to New
                            Westminster. During all this time the canal de Haro has been the only
                            channel used in going from Victoria or the Straits of Fuca, northward
                            into the Gulf of Georgia and places on the Northern Coast. I know both
                            Haro Canal and Rosario Straits. The first is the only one ever used in
                            the large trade between Puget Sound and the British Columbia Mines;
                            between Victoria and the said mines; between San Francisco and the main
                            land of British Columbia. It is the only one by which the heavy coal
                            trade of Nanaimo Mines is carried on. It is straighter, shorter, deeper,
                            fewer rocks, less currents, and is much the safest route, particularly
                            going through at night or in a fog.<seg type="margin">[81]</seg><seg

                        <p>I am intimately acquainted with Capts. McNeil, Swanson, Ella, and Lewis.
                            I knew Capt. Morrat in his life-time. They are old Captains who were in
                            the service of the Hudson’s Bay Company as early as 1840. I have talked
                            with each and all of them on these matters, as it was my business to
                            learn. * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>All their statements to me justify my declaration upon oath, that <pb
                                n="163" xml:id="pg_163" facs="0193"/>since Fort Victoria was
                            established on Vancouver Island, this channel was exclusively used in
                            all trips of their steamers, between said Fort Victoria and their
                            trading-posts North on the Gulf of Georgia, and on the upper Fraser’s
                            River. No other channel but this was talked about by either of them.
                            None other had ever been used in their regular trade, since Fort
                            Victoria was established, which I believe on information was in 1842.
                            Capt. McNeil told me he had been through here in his own vessel, which
                            he brought from Boston, before he was bought out by the Hudson’s Bay
                            Company, and employed in the Company’s service. He also spoke of going
                            through in the steamer Beaver, of which he was Master, when Captain
                            Wilkes was here. * * * * * *<seg type="margin">Haro channel used

                        <p>The Northern Indians always came and went by the same channel in their
                            trips to Victoria, and over to Washington Territory, since I have been
                            here; and from information, and knowledge of Indian customs, I state the
                            opinion they always did use such Canal de Haro in their trips to and
                            from Victoria and their Northern *residences. They always used the same
                            channel when coming to the American side of the straits of Fuca, and the
                            settlements on Puget sound.<seg type="margin">[82]</seg><seg

                        <p>I, Francis Tarbell, of the City of Olympia, County of Thurston, and
                            Territory aforesaid, do solemnly declare upon oath, that I am a
                            native-born Citizen of the United States, aged forty-one years. I went
                            to Victoria, Vancouver’s Island, on the 14th July, 1858, and continued
                            to reside there, doing business as a wholesale merchant, up to 1866. In
                            1862 I became a Director in the Victoria and British Columbia Steamboat
                            Company, and from my connection with said Company, and my business, I
                            became thoroughly acquainted with the Vessels, Steamboats, Route,
                            &amp;c., used by the Steam and other vessels, to and from said City of
                            Victoria. From that knowledge I declare positively and without reserve,
                            that the Canal de Haro was the only channel used by Vessels going to the
                            Gulf of Georgia from Victoria, or from sea-voyages via Straits of Juan
                            de Fuca. In the last fourteen years I have probably been five hundred
                            times to New Westminster at the mouth of Fraser’s <pb n="164"
                                xml:id="pg_164" facs="0194"/>River, in British Columbia. In these
                            trips or voyages, no other channel but the Haro Canal was ever used. * *
                            * * *I am well and intimately acquainted with Capt. McNeil, Capt.
                            Swanston, Capt. Lewis, and Capt. Ella. I was well acquainted with Capt.
                            Wm. A. Morrat in his life-time. These were all old Captains formerly in
                            the employ of the Hudson’s Bay Company. From their statements to me, and
                            from other sources, several of them were here, if not all, before 1840.
                            In my eight years’ residence in Victoria, I was in company with these
                            men a great deal, conversing very freely on the subject of Steamboats,
                            Routes up the Coast, Trade of the Coast, &amp;c. It was in the direct
                            line of my business to learn these mat ters. I freely inquired as to
                            their knowledge, and they freely communicated with me. I have been told
                            frequently by all those gentlemen that the channel now used to reach the
                            Gulf of Georgia in going from Victoria to Nanaimo, Fraser’s River, or to
                            the Northern Coast, or in returning from the same to Victoria, has been
                            invariably used by the Vessels of the Hudson’s Bay Company since Fort
                            Victoria was established. * * *<seg type="margin">[83]</seg><seg

                        <p>I am also positive that Captain McNeil has told me on several occa sions
                            that he used the same channel when sailing a Vessel for the Hudson Bay
                            Company long prior to 1846; and I have heard him make the same statement
                            in regard to the vessel he brought out from Boston before he went into
                            the Company’s service. I am also positive that he has told me that after
                            going into the Company’s employ, long anterior to 1846, he passed
                            through this channel in the steamer Beaver, of which he was Captain,
                            about the time Capt. Wilkes made his survey of these waters. * * * *<seg

                                xml:id="pg_165" facs="0195"/>name I have forgotten. We were again
                            piloted, as before, through Haro Canal. In the latter voyage we
                            encountered a gale from S. E., veering to south, which struck the ship
                            at 6 A. M., and lasted eight hours; ship under close-reef main
                            top-sails, and blowing very heavy all the time. The position of the ship
                            at the time we took the gale was off Chatham Island, with ebb tide. The
                            pilot, as well as myself, entertained no fears for the safety of the
                            ship, as the shores were bold, the water deep, currents so regular, and
                            plenty of sea-room; and we had no fears of the result. I would not like
                            to be caught in Rosario Straits in the same manner. When the gale broke,
                            we were up by Sidney Island—nearly up to the Active Pass. From my
                            experience then and knowledge now, I pronounce the Haro Channel the best
                            Channel or passage between any of the Islands, or between the Main-land
                            and Islands North of the Straits of Fuca. * * * * * * *</p>

                        <p>I, James S. Lawson, Assistant United States Coast Survey, and at present
                            a resident of Olympia, County of Thurston, and Territory of Washington,
                            do solemnly declare upon oath, that I am a native-born citizen of the
                            United States, aged forty-four years; that I came to the Western coast
                            of the United States in June, 1850, in the coast survey, and have been
                            engaged in the same from that time to the present, in all capacities
                            from aid to assistant in charge of a party. From 1852 to 1859, both
                            inclusive, I spent each working season in the surveys of straits of Juan
                            de Fuca, Canal de Haro, Rosario Straits, Gulf of Georgia to forty-ninth
                            parallel of North latitude, and Admiralty Inlet, and since 1866 I have
                            been permanently located in this section, with a residence at
                                Olympia.<seg type="margin">Affidavits on the canal de

                        <p>From several years of such experience and service, I assert the great
                            superiority of the Canal de Haro over the Rosario Strait as a
                            Ship-Channel or Channel of any character, depth of water, width,
                            directness, and freedom from obstructions, rocks, &amp;c. The currents
                            are strong in both, but as a ship-channel the Haro Canal is decidedly
                            superior.</p>
                        <p>While working in the Gulf of Georgia in 1858 and 1859, vessels bound from
                            Victoria to Fraser’s River, Nanaimo, or farther north, invariably <pb
                                n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0196"/> made use of Canal de Haro; in
                            fact I have never heard of a single instance of a vessel sailing from
                            Victoria since 1852, when I came to this section, and bound for any of
                            the above-mentioned places, making use of Rosario Strait. My experience
                            has shown that the Indians of the Northwest Coast always made use of the
                            Canal de Haro, oh their visits to Victoria and returning.</p>

                        <p>On the 2d day of May, 1841, I was serving as an ordinary seaman, on board
                            the United States ship Vincennes, in the United States exploring
                            expedition, Charles Wilkes, United States Navy, Commanding Expedition,
                            and we entered these waters about the above date. I was in the Boat
                            Expedition, surveying both Canal de Haro and Rosario Straits. I served
                            during the whole cruise of the expedition.<seg type="margin">Wilkes
                                surveys canal de Haro in 1841.</seg></p>
                        <p>In 1858 I returned to Washington Territory, and since that time I have
                            been constantly sailing in these waters. I know both channels well, and
                            have been frequently in them, but never in Rosario Straits in a Ship.
                            From my knowledge of said Rosario Straits, I do not think it a safe
                            passage for sailing-vessels. From uncertainty of winds during summer
                            months, and adversity of currents, the passage is unsafe without the use
                            of towing; and in my knowledge it is not, nor has it ever been used by
                            vessels going to or coining from the Gulf of Georgia. The Canal de Haro
                            is the natural route for vessels from Victoria to the Gulf of Georgia
                            and the Northern Coast. It is a safe and good shipchannel, broad, deep,
                            and plenty of sea-room, and less danger from hidden rocks than in
                            Rosario Straits. For heavy-draught Vessels it is the only Channel which
                            can be used.</p>
                        <p>Since I have been here (1858) the Canal de Haro is the Channel invariably
                            used by vessels, American and English, Steam and other vessels going
                            into the Gulf of Georgia from Victoria or the Straits of Fuca.</p>

                        <p>I, Adam Benson, of Pierce County, Washington Territory, do solemnly
                            declare upon oath that I am a citizen of the United States, of the age
                            of fifty-six years, and a native of the North of Scotland. I came to
                            this Territory, then Oregon, in the service of the Hudson Bay Company in
                            1836, and stopped at Fort Nisqually, in what is now Pierce County. I was
                            a shepherd and herder of the Company’s sheep, after Fort Victoria was
                            established in 1842. I made a trip in charge of the company’s sheep from
                            Fort Nisqually to Fort Victoria, in the spring of 1845, just before
                            potato planting. From thence the Steamer Beaver towed the ship Columbia
                            to the mouth of Fraser’s River. We went through the Channel between
                            Vancouver’s Island and San Juan Island. Captain Dodd was the master of
                            the Steamer Beaver. I fix the year 1845, because it was the year that
                            Colonel Simmons came and settled at New Market. I remember that Fort
                            Victoria had only been established two or three years, and all the
                            buildings were not up when I was there.<seg type="margin">The steamer

                        <p>I, William N. Horton, now of the City of Olympia, County of Thurston, and
                            Territory aforesaid, do solemnly declare upon oath, that I am <pb
                                n="168" xml:id="pg_168" facs="0198"/>a native-born citizen of the
                            United States, of the age of forty-two years, and am a Steamboat
                            Engineer by profession. I came to Portland, Oregon, in June, 1850. I
                            came to Puget Sound in May or June, 1854, since which time Olympia has
                            been my residence when upon shore. Early after coming to the Sound, I
                            made a trip in the Sloop Sarah Stone, Captain Thomas Slaten, to all of
                            the Sound Ports, extending our voyage to Fort Victoria, and Nanaimo,
                            upon Vancouver’s Island. We went and returned through the Canal de Haro;
                            at that time it was the only channel used by all Coal Vessels going to
                            and from Nanaimo, by the Hudson’s Bay Company’s Steamers Beaver and
                            Otter in their trips North from Fort Victoria to the trading-posts on
                            the Northern Coast. Indeed it is the only channel which can be
                            profitably or safely used in going from the Straits of Fuca into the
                            Gulf of Georgia, and the inland waters to the North. It was then used by
                            those Steamers, for on that trip, or shortly after, I have seen both of
                            those Steamers, either going from or returning to the then Fort
                            Victoria, now the City of Victoria, on Vancouver’s Island.</p>
                        <p>From the spring of 1855 up to 1858, I was running a Steamer on the Sound,
                            and made numerous trips to Victoria, and saw Steam and other vessels in
                            the Canal de Haro. I never saw or heard of any vessel ever using the
                            Rosario Straits to get into the Gulf of Georgia, in 1858 I was employed
                            on various Steamers running to Fraser’s River, and continued in that
                            business until 1861. The whole trade between Victoria and Fraser’s
                            River, *in all classes of vessels, was entirely and exclusively done in
                            the Canal de Haro.<seg type="margin">[89]</seg></p>
                        <p>I know both channels, having run in both as pilot and Engineer. Haro
                            Channel for all vessels is infinitely superior to Rosario Straits. It is
                            broader, deeper, more direct, less sunken rocks, and the Canal de Haro
                            is perfectly safe at night or in a fog, which I cannot say of Rosario
                            Straits. The currents are strong in both, but in the Canal de Haro much
                            the more regular.<seg type="margin">Affidavits on the canal de
                                Haro.</seg></p>
                        <p>I have very frequently seen the Northern Indians coming and going through
                            Haro Channel, and from my information I believe that such Channel has
                            always been used by them in their trading trips from the North to Fort
                            Victoria. Indians follow customs tenaciously, and do not change their
                            routes; and as this was their custom in 1854, I am positive it was
                            previous thereto.</p>

                        <p>I, John McLeod, of Pierce County, Washington Territory, do solemnly
                            declare upon oath that I am a naturalized citizen of the United States,
                            of the age of fifty-six years, and was born in Lewes Island, North of
                            Scotland. I arrived in this Territory, then Oregon, in the service of
                            the Hudson’s Bay Company, in the Fall *of 1838, at Fort Nisqually on
                            Puget Sound, and immediately was put on board of the Company’s Steamer
                            Beaver; Captain McNeil was then master. While I was on board, she was
                            also commanded by Captain Brotchie and Captain Duncan. My duty was that
                            of Stoker. Up to 1842, when Fort Victoria was established on Vancouver’s
                            Island, she made two trips up North from Fort Nisqually annually, in
                            collecting furs. I continued on board until the spring of 1844, (April,
                            I think,) since which time I have lived in Pierce County, near Fort
                            Nisqually. I know San Juan Island, and the channel between it and
                            Vancouver’s Island. I made in the Steamer Beaver, after 1842, and till I
                            was discharged, at least two trips to the North each year, that is to
                            say in 1842 and 1843. While building the Fort at Victoria till the
                            buildings were well up, we staid in the harbor as a Guard against the
                            Indians, and while thus delayed the Beaver towed the Schooner Cadboro,
                            two or three times to the mouth of Fraser’s River. In all her trips
                            North from Fort Victoria to Fort Simpson, and back, and in towing the
                            Cadboro to Fraser’s River, we always went through the channel between
                            Vancouver’s Island and San Juan Island. After 1842 the Steamer Beaver
                            only came to Fort Nisqually on particular business. Her regular trips
                            twice a year were made between Fort Victoria, on the Island of
                            Vancouver, and the trading-posts north of the Gulf of Georgia. I can
                            remember at least eight or nine trips through the channel between
                            Vancouver’s Island and San Juan Island, while I was engaged as Stoker on
                            the Steamer Beaver.<seg type="margin">[90]</seg><seg type="margin">Canal

                        <p>The undersigned was in Fort Vancouver, on the Columbia River, Oregon, in
                            the month of January, 1837. During my stay at that port of the Hudson’s
                            Bay Company, news came that <pb n="170" xml:id="pg_170" facs="0200"/>one
                            of the Company’s vessels, I think it was the Steamer Beaver, had passed
                            Haro Straits, and found it a shorter, deeper, and better channel from
                            the Gulf of Georgia to Victoria than that nearer the main land.<seg
                                type="margin">Affidavits on the canal de Haro.</seg></p>
                        <p>I was informed, by the Masters of the Hudson’s Bay Company’s vessels,
                            several of whom I have been well acquainted with since the winter of
                            1837, that the Haro Channel was the safest and the one they preferred to
                            any other.</p>
                        <p>From 1858, and onward, I have frequently and invariably passed through
                            the Haro Channel in American and the Company’s steamers, and been
                            assured by all the masters that it was preferable to any other.</p>
                        <p>As to the question of the Company or British ignorance of the Haro
                            Channel, I verily believe it wholly fictitious, and that it was well
                            known to them as early as 1837, and that the Steamer Beaver had passed
                            and repassed it from Victoria, on Vancouver’s Island, to Fort Langley,
                            on Fraser’s River.</p>
                        <p>I, W. H. Gray, do solemnly swear that the foregoing statements are true
                            to the best of my knowledge and belief. So help me God.</p>

                            seventy-two, personally appeared before me, David Eckstein, Consul of
                            the United States of America for the Province of British Columbia,
                            Dominion of Canada, residing at the port of Victoria, <pb n="171"
                                xml:id="pg_171" facs="0201"/>Vancouver Island, William H. Oliver,
                            who, being first duly sworn, states as follows:</p>
                        <p>My age is forty-eight years; my residence is Victoria, Vancouver Island.
                            I have resided here most of the time since eighteen hundred and
                            fifty-eight. I am a retired merchant. I am acquainted with the route of
                            travel by water, by steamers and sail-vessels, British and American, in
                            making trips from Victoria to the Gulf of Georgia and Fraser River,
                            since the year eighteen hundred and fifty-eight. So far as my knowledge
                            extends, the Canal de Haro has been and now is universally used by all
                            classes of vessels.</p>
                        <p>In eighteen hundred and fifty-eight, in December, or in January, eighteen
                            hundred and fifty-nine, I went, as a passenger, on the *Hudson Bay
                            Company’s steamer Beaver, from Victoria to “Derby” or “Old Langley,” as
                            it was called, on Fraser River, and passed through the Canal de Haro, in
                            going and returning. At that time and since, the Canal de Haro is the
                            channel generally, and I think exclusively used by British Steamers and
                            others in going to and returning from Fraser River and Gulf of Georgia
                            to Victoria. Masters of vessels, and navigators generally, have
                            expressed the opinion to me repeatedly, that the Canal de Haro was not
                            only a superior channel to any other between the Continent and Vancouver
                            Island, but was the only one used by mariners in passing from Victoria
                            to the Gulf of Georgia and the Fraser River.<seg type="margin"

                            Haro.</seg></p>
                        <p>I have been acquainted with William H. McNeil, formerly Chief Factor in
                            the Hudson Bay Company, personally since 1864, and by reputation since
                            1858. Since the sixth of the present month I have had a conversation
                            with William H. McNeil, in which I asked him to state at what time the
                            Hudson Bay Company commenced using the Canal de Haro, by steamers and
                            other vessels employed in carrying their fur trade, and the reasons why
                            they had not used it at an earlier day. He stated to me that the Hudson
                            Bay Company commenced using the Canal de Haro, for the above purpose,
                            soon after they established their Trading-post on Vancouver Island,
                            which was, as he said, in eighteen hundred forty-two, or eighteen
                            hundred and forty-three; and that the Company continued to use it, more
                            or less, from that time on.</p>
                        <p>And, further, that the Hudson Bay Company ascertained the value of the
                            Canal de Haro for purposes of navigation, at the time of their
                            commencing to use it as above stated. He further stated that the reason
                            why the Hudson Bay Company had not used the Canal de Haro previous to
                            establishing their Trading-post on Vancouver Island, was their want of
                            knowledge of its real value for purposes of navigation.</p>
                        <p>On pressing my inquiries further upon the subject, the said William H.
                            McNeil stated to me distinctly and positively that the Hudson Bay
                            Company navigated the Canal de Haro with their Steamers as early as one
                            thousand eight hundred and forty-two and continued to navigate the said
                            Canal de Haro thereafter exclusively, in carrying on their trade between
                            Victoria and points on the Gulf of Georgia and Fraser River. William H.
                            McNeil has been in the Hudson Bay Company service since 1837.<seg

                        <p>I, Charles M. Bradshaw, of the City of Port Townsend, County of
                            Jefferson, in said Territory, do solemnly declare upon oath that I am a
                            native-born citizen of the United States, aged forty years; that I came
                            to Washington Territory, then included in the Territory of Oregon, in
                            November, 1852. In March, 1853, I went to Dungeness, on the South side
                            of the Straits of Fuca, in Clallam County, Washington Territory—and took
                            up a Donation Claim—fronting upon the Harbor which is but an indentation
                            in said Straits of Juan de Fuca, where I continued to reside until some
                            time in 1867.</p>
                        <p>From my house, without the weather was very hazy or foggy, I had an
                            unobstructed view to the entrance of Victoria Harbor, the shore of
                            Vancouver Island, the entrance to Canal de Haro, the shore of San Juan
                            Island, and the entrance of Rosario Straits. Between 1853 and 1855 there
                            were no steamers in those localities, except those belonging to the
                            Hudson Bay Company, at Victoria, Vancouver Island, or British vessels of
                            war, and the sight of a vessel propelled by steam was a novelty, and
                            always attracted my attention. It was not an unfrequent occurrence to
                            see a steamer leaving Victoria Harbor, passing around Trial Island, and
                            disappear up de Haro *Straits, on its way to the Gulf of Georgia, and
                            the trading-posts to the North. The Steamers referred to by me were
                            without any doubt the Hudson’s Bay Company’s Steamers Beaver and Otter,
                            and I have no hes itancy in declaring at this time to have been one or
                            the other or both of those vessels. I have yet to see the first Steamer
                            or Sailing vessel come out of Victoria Harbor and go into Rosario
                            Straits. After 1855, at times there were American Steamers making trips
                            between Olympia, Washington Territory, and Victoria.<seg type="margin"

                            Haro.</seg></p>
                        <p>In the spring and summer of 1858 I made a number of trips to Fraser’s
                            River from Victoria, and returned from there to Victoria, each time
                            going through Haro Channel and returning the same way. On two of those
                            trips to Fraser’s River, I was accompanied by from forty to fifty small
                            boats and canoes, many of which boats piloted by Indians, and old Hudson
                            Bay Company bargemen, and discharged servants. In every one of those
                            trips no other route was proposed than through Haro Straits. At that
                            time, and ever since, the Haro Channel was the recognized route of
                            travel from Victoria to the Gulf of Georgia, and to the main-land of
                            British Columbia at and above the mouth of the Fraser’s River. All the
                            Steamers to and from Victoria used that Channel, and none other was
                            spoken of or used either for sailing Vessels or Steamers.</p>

                        <p>Since 1858, I speak from positive knowledge, the Canal de Haro has been
                            exclusively used in the navigation and commerce between Victoria on
                            Vancouver’s Island, and British Columbia, and the Northern Coast.</p>

                        <p>On this 18th day of March, A. D. 1872, personally appeared before me,
                            David Eckstein, Consul of the United States of America for the Province
                            of British Columbia, Dominion of Canada, residing at the Port of
                            Victoria, Vancouver Island, Uriah Nelson, who, being first duly sworn,
                            states as follows:</p>
                        <p>My age is forty-five years, my residence Victoria, Vancouver Island.
                            Since 1859 I have resided here part of the time, and the rest of the
                            time at Yale and Clinton, on the main-land of British Columbia. My
                            occupation is that of Merchant and Forwarding Agent. I am acquainted,
                            since the year 1859, with the course pursued by all classes of vessels,
                            British and American, plying between Victoria and ports or places on the
                            Gulf of Georgia and Fraser River. The Canal de Haro has been since 1859,
                            and is now, universally used as the Channel by all Steamers and
                            Sail-Vessels, British and others, in making trips between the
                            above-named points.</p>
                        <p>Since the year 1859 I have made about one hundred trips between Victoria
                            and New Westminster on the Fraser River, as passenger, in Hudson Bay
                            Company Steamers and others, and every time passed through the Canal de
                            Haro, in going and returning.</p>
                        <p>The Canal de Haro is in fact the main Channel, and the only one regarded
                            as safe by Masters of Steamers and Sail-Vessels, who are acquainted with
                            the waters between the Continent and Vancouver Island.</p>

                            interior de la tierra dos brazos de mar de media legua de ancho que se
                            internan mucho, demorando el uno en el 1er cuadrante y el otro en el 4°
                            los cuales no pudo explorar mas que tres leguas por haberselo impedido
                            los fuertes temporales con copiosa lluvia que tuvo por espacio de doce
                            dias, y que hallándoce sin víveres se vió precisado à dejar la commision
                            sin concluir y durante el dicho tiempo lo insultaron los Indios por tres
                            ocasiones à quienes rechazó con la artilleria, tirando varios canoñazos
                            al viento para separarlos de la Goleta, lo que en breve conseguia pues

                            navegamos la vuelta del 1er cuadrante haciendo los rumbos convenientes
                            para entrar por el canal de Lopez de Aro, lo que conseguimos á las 10½

                            hallándonos á las 11 rebasados enteramente, seguimos en vuelta del
                            cuarto cuadrante por ser la direccion que lleva este canal, por el cual
                            navegamos con viento fresco del tercer cuadrante hasta las 12¼ que
                            refrescó algo mas, por cuya razon no me era posible seguir à la vela por
                            lo mucho que me sotaventeaba de la Goleta (que se habia mandado tender
                            la base) y por lo mismo los aferré, y echando abajo los palos seguí al

                            estar la mar picada. La Goleta, notándome que nada podia grangear se
                            puso à la Capa, y habiendo à la 1½ llegado à su bordo, *mandé arbolar
                            los palos, y largando las velas seguí por la popa de remolque de cuya
                            conformidad seguimos hasta las 8 de la tarde que viendo se estaba
                            poniendo el sol y no temamos ya mas que ventolinas y que por este motivo
                            no podiamos llegar à un fronton de tierra que habiamos demarcado en

                            remo en la demanda, y habiendo reconocido eran dos bocas que sus

                        <p>Nota—que el haber determinado el Comandante saliese con la lancha en
                            conserva con la Goleta ha sido con el fin de que tomasemos con las dos
                            embarcaciones las dos costas de este canal, por habor concebido todos
                            seria mucho mas angosto que el Estrecho, y siendolo pudieramos con mas
                            prontitud concluir su reconocimiento, y por este concepto me dió cuatro
                            dias de término, pero ha sucedido todo muy al contrario, pues nos
                            hallamos en un imponderable archipiélago de islas, con rocas y bocanas,
                            por cuya razon hemos determinado no sepeararnos, tanto por que no serian
                            capaces de encontranos en muchos dias, cuanto por que la lancha no es
                            appropósito para semejante comision en brazos tan anchos por ser muy
                            pequeña y no tener buque para acomodar los necesarios correspondientes
                            al efecto, y asi hemos dispuesto siga la lancha por la popa de la Goleta
                            al remolque y que se ayude con sus velas cuando haya viento y cuando
                            este se calme pase à proa de la Goleta à darle remolque, y erto despesto
                            me pasé à la Goleta a ayudar à mis compañeros, à hacer las muchas
                            marcaciones, enfilaciones y rectificaciones que hay que hacer, y en la
                            tarde hemos dejado por la parte del O te varias bocanas y brazos
                            formados al parecer de muchas islas que sus direcciones prometen alguna

                            útil seguir este porsu esten*sion, lo hemos acordado asi para que luego

                            hemos reconocido varios promontorios de tierra, segun sus estremos
                            demuestran ser grandes islas. A las 6 nos vimos precisados à dar fondo
                            por haber refrescado el terral del E te y lo ejecutamos en 11 brazos de
                            agua fondo canajo, proximo à una punta que parecia tener una pequeña
                            entrada, y habiendome largado con la lancha, reconoci un buen puerto
                            aunque pequeño pues lo mas largo de él tiene una y media millas, y lo
                            mas ancho una, pero resguardada de todo viento y su fondo es de 13 hasta
                            2 brazos arena fina y se halla situado en lo mas sur de la isla de
                            Sayas, y le puse puerto de San Antonio. A las 9½ calmó el terral, y
                            habiendo llegado à la Goleta como à las diez de la mañana, nos levamos y
                            seguimos con los remos de ella y el remolque de la lancha la vuelta del

                            profunda ensenada, dimos fondo en ella en 18 brazos de agua cascagillo,
                            y luego sali con la lancha á reconocerla, la cual tiene de largo de No.

                            y habiendo à las 3 de la tarde concluido el mismo examen que en tan

                            primer cuadrante, lo que conseguimos à las siete y luego que la
                            rebasamos vimos por el cuarto cuadrante un muy grande y dilatado canal,
                            pues segun lo claro del horizonte se alcanzaba á ver mucha distancia, y
                            en el medio de él se distinguia como à perder de vista un pequeño cerro,

                            company; which point it would, in that case, be material to ascertain;
                            and you are, therefore, to endeavor to ascertain accordingly, with as
                            much precision as the circumstances existing at the time may allow; but
                            the discovery of any similar communication more to the southward (should
                            any such exist) would be much more advantageous for the purposes of
                            commerce, and should, therefore, be preferably attended to, and you are,
                            therefore, to give it a preferable attention accordingly.</p>

                        <p>The Government of the United States has never offered any line south of
                            forty-nine, (with the navigation of the Columbia,) and it never will. It
                            behooves all concerned to regard this as a settled point. As to the
                            navigation of the Columbia, permanently or for a *term of years, that is
                            all matter for just, reasonable, and friendly negotiation. But the
                            forty-ninth parallel must be regarded as the general line of boundary,
                            and not to be departed from for any line further south. As to all
                            straits, and sounds, and islands in the neighboring sea, all these are
                            fair subjects for treaty stipulation. If the general basis be agreed to,
                            all the rest, it may be presumed, may be accomplished by the exercise of
                            a spirit of fairness and amity. * * What I meant, and what I said, was,
                            that if 49° should be agreed on as a general basis, I was satisfied to
                            negotiate about all the rest. But the gentleman from Ohio and the Senate
                            will do me the justice to allow that I said, as plainly as I could speak
                            or put down words in writing, that England must not expect anything
                            south of 49°. I said so in so many words.<seg type="margin"

                            the scene which presents itself to a stranger is exceedingly novel and
                            interesting. On his right hand is Washington *Territory, with its snowy
                            mountain range stretching parallel to his course for sixty miles,
                            flanked with Mount Ranier and culminating in the center with Mount
                            Olympus. Of these mountains the base is in some places at the coast, in
                            others many miles from it. This range is occasionally intersected with
                            deep and gloomy valleys, of which the Valley of Angels is the gloomiest
                            and most remarkable; and every succession <pb n="179" xml:id="pg_179"
                                facs="0209"/>of cloud and sunshine changes the panorama. On his left
                            is Vancouver Island, in contrast looking low, although even there as
                            late as June some specks of snow may be detected on distant mountain
                            tops. Straight before him is the Gulf of Georgia, studded with
                            innumerable islands.—(P. 8.)<seg type="margin">[104]</seg><seg

                        <p>Victoria was selected by Governor Douglas, whose intimate acquaintance
                            with every crevice in the coast ought to carry considerable weight, as
                            “the site” in 1842, when he expressed his confidence “that there was no
                            sea port north of the Columbia, where so many advantages could be
                            combined;” an opinion which was confirmed by Sir George Simpson in his
                            dispatch of June 21, 1844, in which he states, “The situation of
                            Victoria is peculiarly eligible, the country and climate remarkably
                            fine, and the harbor excellent.” And again: “June, 1846.—Fort Victoria
                            promises to become a very important place.”—(P. 50.)</p>

                            of exclusive trade to the Hudson’s Bay Company, the trade of that coast
                            was engrossed by the subjects of the United States of America and
                            Russia, the only establishment occupied by British traders being
                            “Astoria,” afterward named “Fort George,” at the mouth of the Columbia
                            River, while no attempt was made, through the means of shipping, to
                            obtain any part of the trade of the coast; and so unprofitable was it in
                            the years 1818, 1819, 1820, 1821, and 1822, and so difficult of
                            management, that several of the leading and most intelligent persons *in
                            the country strongly recommended that the Company should abandon it
                            altogether. The Company, however, felt that the honor of the concern
                            would, in a certain degree, be compromised were they to adopt that
                            recommendation; holding as they did under Government the License in
                            question, and with a degree of energy and enterprise which I feel
                            assured your Lordships will admit reflects much credit on themselves and
                            on their officers and servants in the country, they directed their
                            efforts so vigorously to that branch of the business, that they
                            compelled the American adventurers, one by one, to withdraw from the
                                contest.<seg type="margin">The Hudson’s Bay Company expel Americans

                            confident it was before the news of the treaty of 1846 reached us,) Dr.
                            McLaughlin said to me in relation to Captain N. Wyeth, who <pb n="180"
                                xml:id="pg_180" facs="0210"/>left this country in 1836, “That if he
                            (Captain Wyeth) had not accepted his proposition for the purchase of his
                            goods and Forts, the Company would have insisted on other means to get
                            rid of his (Captain Wyeth’s) competition in the fur trade.” I have
                            always understood this intimation to mean that the Company would insist
                            upon letting loose their Indian or Aboriginal allies upon Captain Wyeth
                            or any other American furtrader that might presume to compete with them
                            in the fur trade, the same as I am fully satisfied they did in the case
                            of a Mr. G. Smith, the partner of Sublit &amp; Jackson, in 1828. The

                            that, in the multiplicity of business which comes before your lordship,
                            some parts may have been overlooked, or that I may not have been
                            sufficiently explicit, I have thought it advisable to trouble you with a
                            few lines.<seg type="margin">The Hudson’s Bay Company suggest to Lord
                                Aberdeen to draw the boundary line through the channel used by
                                Vancouver.</seg></p>
                        <p>In the first place, I assume that the forty-ninth degree of latitude,
                            from its present terminus, will be continued across the continent to the
                            waters known as the Gulf of Georgia, and be the line of demarkation of
                            the continent between Great Britain and the United States.</p>
                        <p>The next question on which the government of the two countries will have
                            to decide will be as to the islands abutting on and in the Gulf of
                            Georgia, viz, one, Vancouver Island, intersected by the parallel of 49°,
                            and others which are wholly on the south of that parallel. With respect
                            to the former, I think upon the principle of mutual convenience, (and
                            which I think should form the foundation of the treaty,) Great Britain
                            is entitled to the harbor on its southeast end, being the <hi

                            up to the United States; that with respect to the other islands, the
                            water demarkation line should be from the center of the water in the
                            Gulf of Georgia in the forty-ninth degree along the line colored red, as
                            navigable in the chart made by Vancouver, till it reaches a line drawn
                            through the center of the Straits of Juan de Fuca.</p>

                        <p>But in regard to this portion of the boundary line a preliminary question
                            arises, which turns upon the interpretation of the treaty, rather than
                            upon the result of local observation and survey.<seg type="margin">The
                                British government wishes the American to agree on the channel used
                                by Vancouver as the boundary.</seg></p>
                        <p>The convention of the 15th June, 1846, declares that the line shall be
                            drawn through the middle of the “channel” which separates the continent
                            from Vancouver’s Island. And upon this it may be asked what the word
                            “channel” was intended to mean.</p>
                        <p>Generally speaking, the word “channel,” when employed in treaties, means
                            a deep and navigable channel. In the present case it is believed that
                            only one channel—that, namely, which was laid down by Vancouver in his
                            chart—has in this part of the gulf been hitherto surveyed and used; and
                            it seems natural to suppose that the negotiators of the Oregon
                            convention, in employing the word “channel,” had that particular channel
                            in view.</p>
                        <p>If this construction be mutually adopted, no preliminary difficulty will
                            exist, and the commissioners will only have to ascertain the course of
                            the line along the middle of that channel, and along the middle of the
                            Straits of Fuca down to the sea.</p>
                        <p>It is, indeed, on all accounts, to be wished that this arrangement should
                            be agreed upon by the two governments, because otherwise much time might
                            be wasted in surveying the various intricate channels formed by the
                            numerous islets which lie between Vancouver’s Island and the main-land,
                            and some difficulty might arise in deciding which of those channels
                            ought to be adopted for the dividing boundary.</p>
                        <p>The main channel marked in Vancouver’s chart is, indeed, somewhat nearer
                            to the continent than to Vancouver’s Island, and its adoption would
                            leave on the British side of the line rather more of those small islets
                            with which that part of the gulf is studded, than would remain on the
                            American side. But these islets are of little or no value.</p>

                        <p>4. By a careful consideration of the wording of the treaty, it would seem
                            distinctly to provide that the channel mentioned should possess three
                            characteristics: 1st. It should separate the <hi rend="italic"
                                >continent</hi> from Vancouver’s Island. 2d. It should admit of the
                            boundary line being carried through the middle of it in a southerly
                            direction. 3d. It should be a navigable channel. To these three peculiar
                            conditions the channel known as the Rosario Strait most entirely
                                answers.<seg type="margin">Admiral Prevost on the channel of the

                        <p>5. It is readily admitted that the Canal de Arro is also a navigable
                            channel, and therefore answers to one characteristic of the channel of
                            the treaty.</p>

                        <p>As the radical principle of the boundary is the forty-ninth degree of
                            latitude, and the only reason for departing from it was to give the

                        <p>Captain Prevost finally proposed such a compromise as would throw within

                            consequently “the channel” intended by the treaty, and being supported
                            in this opinion by indisputable contemporaneous evidence of the highest

                            <p>Practically it can make no difference whether the main channel be
                                adopted as “<hi rend="italic">the</hi> channel” intended by the
                                treaty upon the “generally admitted principle” recognized by Mr.
                                Crampton, and assented to by Her Majesty’s government in 1848, or
                                whether the Canal de Haro be adopted on the proof of contemporaneous
                                evidence that it was proposed by the British government, and in good
                                faith accepted by the United States as the boundary channel. In
                                either case the Canal de Haro would be the boundary channel. In
                                advocating it with Captain Prevost, I did not confine myself singly
                                to either of these sufficient grounds, but maintained both, with
                                others equally forcible and tenable.</p>
                            <p>Under the mere letter of the treaty, without any knowledge of, or
                                reference to, the motives which induced the adoption of the water
                                boundary, “the channel which separates the continent from
                                Vancouver’s Island” may fairly be construed as follows:</p>
                            <p>1. As “<hi rend="italic">the</hi> channel,” that is, the <hi
                                    rend="italic">main channel</hi>, if there be more than one. And
                                this is the view taken by nautical men generally, including officers
                                of our navy whom I have consulted in reference to the language of
                                the treaty.</p>
                            <p>2. The channel nearest to <hi rend="italic">Vancouver’s</hi> Island,
                                without regard to its size, so that it is navigable; the proviso to
                                the first article requiring that the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >navigation</hi> of said channel shall be free and open to both
                                parties. If it had been intended to mean any other channel than that
                                nearest Vancouver’s Island, that island need not to have been
                                mentioned at all, or, if referred to, “the channel which separates
                                the continent from the archipelago east of Vancouver’s Island,” or
                                “the channel nearest the continent,” would have been the proper
                                description of the channel now claimed by the British commissioner
                                under “the peculiarly precise and clear” language of the treaty.</p>
                            <p>3. Upon the international ground that islands are natural append ages
                                to the continent, and that, unless otherwise agreed, <hi
                                    rend="italic">all</hi> *the islands between the continent and
                                Vancouver’s Island east of the nearest navigable channel to
                                Vancouver’s Island pertain to the continent.<seg type="margin"
                                    >[111]</seg></p>
                            <p>The Canal de Haro would be the channel under either of the above
                                legitimate readings of the treaty.</p>
                            <p>But leaving the mere letter of the treaty, and referring to the
                                history of the negotiation to ascertain the cause which prevented
                                the United States and the British government from agreeing upon the
                                prolongation <pb n="184" xml:id="pg_184" facs="0214"/>of the
                                forty-ninth parallel to the ocean, it will be found that the
                                southern end of Vancouver’s Island was alone the stumbling-block.
                                The British government refused to concede it to the United States,
                                four-fifths of the island being north of the forty-ninth parallel;
                                and the southern end, with its harbors, being the most valuable
                                portion. The United States, considering the disadvantages of a
                                divided jurisdiction of the island, and the probabilities of
                                difficulties arising therefrom, reluctantly yielded it. This was the
                                sole object in deviating from the forty-ninth parallel, and reduces
                                the water boundary to a very simple question. It was a second
                                compromise line. Divested of all quibbles, the meaning of the treaty
                                is that the forty-ninth parallel shall be the dividing line between
                                the territories of the United States and the British possessions
                                until it reaches “the middle” of the nearest natural boundary to <hi
                                    rend="italic">Vancouver’s</hi> Island; and thence the line shall
                                be run to the ocean by the nearest natural boundary, in such a
                                direction as will give the whole of Vancouver’s Island to that power
                                upon whose side the greatest portion would fall by the prolongation
                                of the parallel to the ocean.</p>

                            distinctly remembers the general tenor of his conversation with Mr.
                            MacLane on the subject of the Oregon boundary, and it *is certain that
                            it was the intention of the treaty to adopt the <hi rend="italic"
                                >mid-channel of the straits</hi> as the line of demarkation, without
                            any reference to islands, the position, and, indeed, the very existence,
                            of which had hardly, at that time, been accurately ascertained; and he
                            has no recollection of any mention having been made during the
                            discussion of the Canal de Haro, or, indeed, any other channel than
                            those described in the treaty itself.<seg type="margin">[112]</seg><seg

                            United States, while much importance is attached by British colonial
                            authorities, and by Her Majesty’s government, to its retention as a
                            dependency of the colony of Vancouver’s Island.</p>
                        <p>Her Majesty’s government must, therefore, under any circumstances,
                            maintain the right of the British Crown to the island of San Juan. The
                            interests at stake in connection with the retention of that island are
                            too important to admit of compromise, and your lordship will
                            consequently bear in mind that whatever arrangement as to the boundary
                            line is finally arrived at, no settlement of the question will be
                            accepted by Her Majesty’s government which does not provide for the
                            island of San Juan being reserved to the British Crown.</p>

                            <p>I have examined the papers put into my hands, by Mr. Hammond,
                                relating to the line of boundary to be established between the
                                British and the United States possessions on the northwest coast of
                                America, and I have endeavored to call to mind any circumstance
                                which might have occurred at the time when the Oregon treaty was
                                concluded (15th June, 1846) of a nature either to strengthen or
                                invalidate the pretension now put forward by the United States
                                Commissioner, to the effect that the boundary contemplated by the
                                treaty would be a line passing down the middle of the channel called
                                Canal de Haro, and not, as suggested on the part *of Great Britain,
                                along the middle of the channel called Vancouver’s or Rosario
                                Strait, neither of which two lines could, as I conceive, exactly
                                fulfill the conditions of the treaty, which, according to their
                                literal tenor, would require the line to be traced along the middle
                                of the channel (meaning, I presume, the whole intervening space)
                                which separates the continent from Vancouver’s Island. And I think I
                                can safely assert that the treaty of 15th June, 1846, was signed and
                                ratified without any intimation to us whatever, on the part of the
                                United States Government, as to the particular direction to be given
                                to the line of boundary contemplated by article I of that
                                    treaty.<seg type="margin">Sir R. Pakenham in 1859 denies the

                            <p>All that we knew about it was that it was to run “through the middle
                                of the channel which separates the continent from Vancouver’s
                                Island, and thence southerly through the middle of the said channel
                                and of Fuca’s Straits to the Pacific Ocean.”</p>
                            <p>It is true that in a dispatch from Mr. MacLane, then United States
                                minister in London, to the Secretary of State, Mr. Buchanan, dated
                                18th May, 1846, which dispatch, however, was not made public until
                                after the ratification of the treaty by the Senate, Mr. MacLane
                                informs his government that the line of boundary about to be
                                proposed by Her Majesty’s government would “probably be
                                substantially to divide the territory by the extension of the line
                                in the parallel of 49° to the sea, that is to say, to the arm of the
                                sea called Birch’s Bay, thence by the Canal de Haro and straits of
                                Fuca to the ocean.”</p>
                            <p>It is also true that Mr. Senator Benton, one of the ablest and most
                                zealous advocates for the ratification of the treaty, (relying, no
                                doubt, on the statement furnished by Mr. MacLane,) did, in his
                                speech on the subject, describe the intended line of boundary to be
                                one passing along the middle of the Haro channel.</p>
                            <p>But, on the other hand, the Earl of Aberdeen, in his final
                                instructions, dated 18th May, 1846, says nothing whatever about the
                                Canal de Haro, but, on the contrary, desires that the line might be
                                drawn “in a southerly direction through the center of King George’s
                                Sound and the Straits of Fuca to the Pacific Ocean.”<seg
                                    type="margin">Sir R. Pakenham misstates Lord Aberdeen’s

                            <p>It is my belief that neither Lord Aberdeen, nor Mr. MacLane, nor Mr.
                                Buchanan possessed at that time a sufficiently accurate knowledge of
                                the geography or hydrography of the region in question to enable
                                them to define more accurately what was the intended line of
                                boundary than is expressed in the words of the *treaty, and it is
                                certain that Mr. Buchanan signed the treaty with Mr. MacLane’s
                                dispatch before him, and yet that he made no mention whatever of the
                                “Canal de Haro” as that “through which the line of boundary would
                                run, as understood by the United States government.”<seg

                        <p>The words of the treaty are “through the middle of said channel and of
                            Fuca’s Straits to the Pacific Ocean.” Ordinarily, and in the absence of
                            any other controlling circumstances, the way which would be selected
                            from one given point to another would be the shortest and the best way.
                            In the present ease this is the Canal de Haro, which is, undoubtedly,
                            the broadest, the deepest, and the shortest route by which the Straits
                            of Fuca can be reached from the point of deflection. This pre-eminence
                            was given to it by De Mofras as long ago as 1841, and it has been fully
                            confirmed by subsequent surveys. The Canal de Haro may, therefore, be
                            fairly regarded, from its own intrinsic merits merely, as the main
                            channel down the middle of which the treaty boundary is to pass to the
                            Straits of Fuca.<seg type="margin">Mr Casa on the channel of the
                                treaty.</seg></p>
                        <p>It is the only channel, moreover, which is consistent with the purpose of
                            those who negotiated the treaty, for it is the only channel which
                            separates Vancouver’s Island from the continent without leaving
                            something more to Great Britain south of the forty-ninth parallel than
                            the southern cape of that island. The Rosario Channel, claimed by
                            Captain Prevost, would surrender to Great Britain not only Vancouver’s
                            Island, but the whole archipelago between that island and itself; while
                            the middle channel, which is *proposed as a compromise by Lord John
                            Russell, would, in like manner, concede the important island of San
                                Juan.<seg type="margin">[115]</seg></p>
                        <p>These considerations seem to be almost conclusive in favor of the Haro
                            Channel. But they are abundantly confirmed by evidence contemporaneous
                            with the negotiation of the treaty. The description given by Mr.
                            MacLane, immediately after he had an interview on the subject with Lord
                            Aberdeen, of what the British proposal would be, has already been
                            mentioned, and carries the line in so many words down the Canal de Haro.
                            Equally clear is the statement of Senator Benton as to what the
                            proposition was. Colonel Benton was one of the most earnest members of
                            the Senate in his support of the treaty; and he was better acquainted,
                            perhaps, than any other member with the geography of the region in
                            dispute. His construction, therefore, of the treaty, at the very time it
                            was before the Senate for ratification, is entitled to no inconsiderable
                            weight. On that occasion he said: “The first article is in the very
                            words which I myself would have used, * * * and that article constitutes
                            the treaty. With me it is the treaty. * * * The great question was that
                            of boundary. * * * * When the line reaches the channel which separates
                            Vancouver’s Island from the continent * * * it proceeds to the middle of
                            the channel, and thence turning south through the channel de Haro
                            (wrongly written <pb n="187" xml:id="pg_187" facs="0217"/><hi
                                rend="italic">Arro</hi> in the maps) to the Straits of Fuca.” Mr.
                            Buchanan, who signed the treaty, was equally explicit in his
                            understanding of this part of it.</p>
                        <p>On the 28th December, 1846, Mr. Bancroft having written to him on the
                            subject from London, he inclosed to him a traced copy of Wilkes’s Chart
                            of the Straits of Arro, and added in his letter: “It is not probable,
                            however, that any claim of this character will be seriously preferred by
                            Her Britannic Majesty’s government to any island lying to the eastward
                            of the Canal de Arro, as marked in Captain Wilkes’s map of the Oregon
                            Territory.” Mr. Bancroft, who was a member of President Polk’s Cabinet
                            when the treaty was concluded, wrote repeatedly to Lord Palmerston after
                            receiving this chart, and uniformly described the Straits of Arro “as
                            the channel through the middle of which the boundary is to be
                            continued.” * * * The Canal de Haro, then, as being the best channel
                            leading from the point of deflection to the Straits of Fuca; as
                            answering completely the purpose for which the deflection was made; as
                            being the only channel between the island and the main-land *which does
                            answer this purpose, and as being supported, also, by a large amount of
                            personal testimony contemporaneous with the treaty, must fairly be
                            regarded, in my judgment, as the treaty channel.<seg type="margin"

                        <p>Nor are there any important difficulties which seem to me to be
                            necessarily in conflict with this conclusion. Lord John Russell, indeed,
                            says that it is beyond dispute that the intentions of the British
                            government were that the line of boundary should be drawn through
                            Vancouver’s Channel. But this assumption is wholly inconsistent, not
                            only with the treaty itself, but with the statements both of the Earl of
                            Aberdeen and of Sir Richard Pakenham. Lord Aberdeen declares that it was
                            the intention of the treaty to adopt the <hi rend="italic">mid-channel
                                of the straits</hi> at the time of demarkation, without reference to
                            islands, the position of which, and indeed the very existence of which,
                            had hardly at that time been accurately ascertained; “and he has no
                            recollection of any mention having been made during the discussion of
                            any other channel than those described in the treaty itself.” Sir
                            Richard Pakenham is still more explicit. “Neither the Canal de Haro nor
                            the channel of Vancouver,” he says, “could, as I conceive, exactly
                            fulfill the conditions of the treaty which, according to their literal
                            tenor, would require the line to be traced along the middle of the
                            channel, meaning, I presume, the whole intervening space which separates
                            the continent from Vancouver’s Island.” He adds further, that he has no
                            recollection whatever that any other channel was designated in the
                            discussions than that described in the language of the treaty. Surely
                            there is nothing in this testimony which supports the statement of Lord
                            John Russell that the channel of Vancouver was the channel intended by
                            the treaty; but on the contrary another and entirely different channel
                            is suggested as that which the convention requires. After these
                            statements of Lord Aberdeen and Sir Richard Pakenham, the Rosario
                            Channel can no longer, it seems to me, be placed in competition with the
                            Canal de Haro. Whether the latter is the true channel or not, in the
                            opinion of the British negotiation, it is quite certain, by the
                            concurrent testimony of both the American and British negotiators, that
                            the former channel is not. In respect, moreover, to the Canal de Haro,
                            the other considerations to which I have referred appear to me to quite
                            outweigh the mere want of recollection of Lord Aberdeen and Sir Richard
                            Pakenham, or their general impression at this time as to what is
                            required by the literal language of the treaty.</p>
                        <p>*There is one allusion in Sir Richard Pakenham’s memorandum to which I
                            think it right to call your special attention. It is the <pb n="188"
                                xml:id="pg_188" facs="0218"/>reference which he makes to his final
                            instructions from Lord Aberdeen, dated May 18, 1846, and describing the
                            boundary line which he was authorized to propose to Mr. Buchanan. These
                            instructions were shown by Lord Napier to Mr. Campbell, and according to
                            his clear recollection, the description quoted by Sir Richard Pakenham
                            was followed in dispatch by these words: “Thus giving to Great Britain
                            the whole of Vancouver’s Island and its harbors.” This places beyond
                            controversy the object which was intended by deflecting the treaty
                            boundary south of the parallel of 49°, and ought to have great weight,
                            undoubtedly, in determining the true channel from the point of
                            deflection to the Straits of Fuca. * * *<seg type="margin"

                            Lordship that in what-ever manner the question was ultimately settled,
                            Her Majesty’s government could not yield the island of San Juan, Her
                            Majesty’s government were, by implication, abandoning a large part of
                            the territory they had claimed, and were merely insisting on the
                            retention of an island, which, from the peculiarity of its situation, it
                            was impossible for Her Majesty’s government to cede without compromising
                            interests of the gravest importance.<seg type="margin">The British
                                government in 1859 does not claim the so-called Rosario as the

                        <p>* * * The fact is, that, by the instructions with which Captain Prevost
                            was furnished, he was authorized, in case he should be of opinion that
                            the claims of Her Majesty’s government, to consider the Rosario Strait
                            as the channel of the treaty, could not be sustained, to adopt any other
                            intermediate channel on which he and the United States commissioner
                            might agree.</p>
                        <p>* * * * Sir R. Pakenham seems to think that the conditions of the treaty
                            would obtain their most exact fulfillment if the line were carried
                            through the Douglas Channel.<seg type="margin">[118]</seg></p>
                        <p>* * * Or, again, if it would be inconvenient to both nations to have five
                            or six islands partially divided between them, would it not be fair and
                            expedient to look for a channel which shall be the nearest approximation
                            to that line, midway between the continent and the island of Vancouver,
                            which is designated by the treaty? And if Douglas’s Channel fulfills
                            this condition, is it not the line most in accordance with the treaty,
                            as well as with general policy and convenience?</p>
                        <p>* * * If I notice General Cass’s allusion to the letters which he says
                            Mr. Bancroft repeatedly wrote to Lord Palmerston in 1848, it is only for
                            the purpose of placing on record what, no doubt, Mr. Bancroft duly
                            reported to his government at the time, viz, that Lord Palmerston gave
                            Mr. Bancroft distinctly to understand that the British government did
                            not acquiesce in the pretensions of the United States that the boundary
                            line should be run down the Haro Channel. * * *<seg type="margin">Lord

                                silence.</seg></p>

                        <p>1. The Government of Her Britannic Majesty, in pursuance of Article XXXVI
                            of the Treaty of Washington of 1871, have drawn up and now lay before
                            His Majesty the Emperor of Germany, as Arbitrator, this their second and
                            definitive Statement, in reply to the Memorial or Case presented in the
                            name of the United States Government by Mr. Bancroft.</p>
                        <p>2. The matter of Mr. Bancroft’s Memorial (as far as it is of an
                            argumentative character) may, for the purposes of the examination to
                            which Her Majesty’s Government propose here to subject it, be ranged in
                            the following divisions:</p>
                        <p>I. Mr. Bancroft assumes that at the date of the Treaty of 1846 the United
                            States had a clear tide to the whole Oregon district, up to the
                            forty-ninth parallel of latitude at least; represents the arrangement
                            embodied in the Treaty as a pure concession on the part of the United
                            States; and contends that the concession should consequently be confined
                            within the narrowest limits.</p>
                        <p>II. He maintains that the object of the arrangement embodied in the
                            Treaty was to secure to Her Majesty the whole of Vancouver’s Island, and
                            no more.</p>
                        <p>III. He adduces what he considers evidence to show that the construction
                            now contended for by the United States was the admitted construction at
                            the time of the making of the Treaty.</p>
                        <p>IV. He represents the Treaty as specially the work of Her Majesty’s
                            Government, and seems to suggest that they are consequently precluded
                            from maintaining any construction of the Treaty not admitted by the
                            other side.</p>
                        <p>V. He maintains that the language of the Treaty admits no interpretation
                            but the American, and that it points to the Canal de Haro, and to that
                            channel alone.</p>
                        <p>*3. An examination of the arguments on these points, to be intelligible,
                            must be accompanied by an historical explanation of the circumstances
                            attendant on the Treaty. For that purpose many documents must be set out
                            at length. It is, therefore, more convenient to present the explanation
                            in the form of a separate paper. It is accordingly subjoined to this
                            Statement as an Historical Note; and Her Majesty’s Government beg that
                            the Note, with the other papers appended to this Statement, may be taken
                            as part thereof.<seg type="margin">[2]</seg></p>
                        <p>4. The Note shows the relative positions of the principal actors in the
                            matter of the Treaty; in London, the Earl of Aberdeen, Her Majesty’s
                            Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and Mr. MacLane, the
                            United States Minister Plenipotentiary; at Washington, Mr. Pakenham, Her
                            Majesty’s Minister Plenipotentiary, and Mr. Buchanan, the <pb n="196"

                                there are appended to the Historical Note, (1) a Chronological List,
                                showing the names and dates of appointment of the various Principal
                                Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs in Great Britain and
                                British Ministers at Washington, and of the various Presidents and
                                Secretaries of State of the United States and United States
                                Ministers at London, from 1818 to 1872; and (2) a Memorandum
                                relative to the origin and privileges of the Hudson’s Bay Company, a
                                corporation frequently named in this discussion.</note> It is
                            designed to bring out the facts which will be seen in the course of this
                            Statement to be of cardinal importance, namely, that the Treaty was
                            formally negotiated at Washington between Mr. Pakenham and Mr. Buchanan;
                            that it was on two distinct occasions discussed and approved by the
                            Senate of the United States, in their capacity, under the Constitution,
                            of a co-ordinate branch of the treaty-making power; that the project or
                            draught of the Treaty was prepared in London by Lord Aberdeen, and sent
                            to Mr. Pakenham, as embodying the proposal which Mr. Pakenham was
                            instructed to make to the Government of the United States; that this
                            project was, as regards the words now in discussion, identical with the
                            Treaty as signed and ratified; and that, although Mr. MacLane was not
                            formally empowered to conduct negotiations in the matter on behalf of
                            his Government, yet Lord Aberdeen discussed with him the nature of the
                            proposal which Her Majesty’s Government contemplated making to the
                            United States, and even showed him the project of the Treaty before it
                            was sent to Mr. Pakenham.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi>
                            <note n="2" xml:id="d122fn2"> Historical Note, p. xx.</note></p>
                        <p rend="center">I.</p>
                        <p>5. Mr. Bancroft’s assumption that the United States were clearly entitled
                            to the whole Oregon district up to the forty-ninth parallel is not
                            warranted by the facts of the case. Territorial rights in the whole
                            district were claimed by both parties with equal persistency, and their
                            respective contentions were supported by arguments drawn from like
                            sources, such as the history of discovery and the terms of international
                            engagements. In the official documents on both sides the alternative of
                            war was shadowed forth. In the end there was a compromise; each party
                            yielded a portion of what it had contended in argument was its
                            right.</p>
                        <p>6. When, on one occasion in the course of this long controversy between
                            the two Governments, Mr. Cass, the United States Secretary of State, had
                            put forward an assumption like this of Mr. Bancroft, Lord John Russell,
                            then Her Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,
                                said:<hi rend="superscript">3</hi>
                            <note n="3" xml:id="d122fn3"> Lord John Russell to Lord Lyons, December
                                16, 1859; read, and copy given, to United States Secretary of
                                State.</note></p>
                        <p>Undoubtedly, the title by which Great Britain now holds British Columbia
                            and Vancouver’s Island is the same as that by which the United States
                            possess the Oregon State and Washington *Territory, namely, the Treaty
                            of 1846; but when General Cass asserts, that previously to that Treaty
                            the title of the United States to the whole of the territory between the
                            parallels 42° and 54° 40′ had been clear and unquestionable, Her
                            Majesty’s Government can only reply that, in their opinion, it was the
                            title of Great Britain to that territory which was clear and
                                indisputable.<seg type="margin">[3]</seg></p>
                        <p>It is plain that when this was written, Her Majesty’s Government had not
                            adopted the notion that in 1846 the concession had been all on the side
                            of the United States; nor, have they ever changed their position.</p>
                        <pb n="197" xml:id="pg_197" facs="0227"/>
                        <p>7. Mr. Bancroft further assumes that the United States had, before the
                            Treaty, the forty-ninth parallel as an admitted boundary line on the
                            Continent. Such an admission had never been made by Her Majesty’s
                            Government. That boundary would not (it is plain) have been conceded on
                            the Continent without a concurrent arrangement satisfactory to Her
                            Majesty’s Government respecting Vancouver’s Island and the navigation of
                            the adjacent waters.</p>
                        <p>8. The passage in Mr. Bancroft’s Memorial in which his assumptions under
                            this head are most strongly put is the following, (page 30:)</p>
                        <p>Again, “where a right admits of different degrees, it is only the
                            smallest degree which may he taken for granted.” (Ist ein Recht
                            verschiedener Abstufungen fähig, so darf zunächst nur die geringste
                            Stufe als zugestanden angenommen werden.”) This rule of Heffter fits the
                            present case so aptly, that it seems made for it. There being degrees in
                            the departure from the parallel of 49°, it must he taken that only the
                            smallest degree was conceded.</p>
                        <p>The rule cited from Dr. Heffter’s work does not touch the present case.
                            This is not the case of a party making a concession in derogation of a
                            clear and admitted right. It is the case of one concession set off
                            against another; of a give-and-take arrangement.<hi rend="superscript"
                                >1</hi>
                            <note n="4" xml:id="d122fn4"> Historical Note, p. viii.</note></p>
                        <p>9. The preamble of the Treaty is express on this point. The two Powers
                            (it says:)</p>
                        <p>Deeming it desirable for the future welfare of both countries that the
                            state of doubt and uncertainty which has hitherto prevailed respecting
                            the sovereignty and government of the territory on the Northwest coast
                            of America, lying westward of the Rocky or Stony Mountains, should be
                            finally terminated by an amicable compromise of the rights mutually
                            asserted by the two parties over the said territory, have respectively
                            named Plenipotentiaries to treat and agree concerning the terms of such
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p rend="center">II.</p>
                        <p>10. Closely connected in character with the arguments of Mr. Bancroft
                            under the first head, and equally inconclusive, as Her Majesty’s
                            Government submit, are his arguments under the second.</p>
                        <p>11. Mr. Bancroft alleges in effect that the intention of the Contracting
                            Parties was only to avoid cutting off the end of Vancouver’s Island, and
                            he infers that the line is to be strictly so drawn as to effect this
                            object, and no more. Her Majesty’s Government dispute both the
                            allegation and the inference.</p>
                        <p>12. There is no evidence that the prevention of the severance of
                            Vancouver’s Island was the sole object of the arrangement. There is
                            nothing to support the allegation, *either in the preamble of the
                            Treaty, or in the Article describing the boundary; nor can it be
                            sustained on the ground of anything contained in any of the
                            contemporaneous documents exchanged between the Contracting Parties. It
                            is true that the severance of Vancouver’s Island by a boundary line
                            drawn continuously on the forty-ninth parallel was the salient objection
                            raised on the part of Her Majesty’s Government to the United States
                            proposal for continuing the boundary on that parallel from the Rocky
                            Mountains to the Pacific. That proposal disregarded the physical
                            conditions of the tract through which the line would run. It is true
                            also that a deflection of the line so as not to sever Vancouver’s Island
                            was made in effect a condition <hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi> on
                            the part of Her Majesty. It may even be admitted that the prevention of
                            this severance was the motive for Article I of the Treaty. The nature of
                            the motive is not necessarily a measure of the scope of the
                                stipulation.<seg type="margin">[4]</seg></p>
                        <p>13. It is plain on the face of the Article that the Contracting Parties
                                <pb n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0228"/>had further and other aims.
                            If the sole object of the stipulation had been to keep Vancouver’s
                            Island one, a very simple provision would have sufficed. It would have
                            been enough to say the whole of Vancouver’s Island shall belong to Her
                            Britannic Majesty. The Article in effect says this, but it says more in
                            two respects. First, it in effect vests in Her Majesty, as against the
                            United States, the whole territorial sovereignty and property over and
                            in all land and sea adjacent to the island on its eastern and southern
                            sides, lying within the mid-channel line, (wherever drawn,) although
                            lying beyond the ordinary territorial three-mile limit. Secondly, it
                            secures to Her Majesty’s subjects freedom of navigation throughout the
                            whole extent of the boundary-channel and of the Straits of Fuca. These
                            two provisions in combination effect what was plainly one of Lord
                            Aberdeen’s main objects in the arrangement, namely, the preservation to
                            Her Majesty’s subjects of unquestionable and abundant facilities of
                            access to the British coasts and harbors north of the 49th parallel. Had
                            the boundary line been continued on the 49th parallel to the ocean, the
                            navigation of the Gulf of Georgia from the southward would have been
                            sealed to British subjects.</p>
                        <p>14. The Article speaks for itself. The preservation of the unity of
                            Vancouver’s Island was of the essence of the arrangement, but there were
                            collateral arrangements. The difference now referred to arbitration
                            presupposes the existence of such arrangements; the controversy is as to
                            their extent.</p>
                        <p>15. Lord Aberdeen’s instructions to Mr. Pakenham cannot be read so as to
                            cut down the effect of the Treaty. They must be interpreted so as to
                            correspond in scope with the project of the Treaty prepared and sent
                            contemporaneously by Lord Aberdeen. The words quoted by Mr. Bancroft
                            (page 19) from Lord Aberdeen’s instructions are:</p>
                        <p>Leaving the <hi rend="italic">whole of Vancouver’s Island</hi>, <hi
                                rend="italic">with its ports and harbors</hi>, <hi rend="italic">in
                                the possession of Great Britain.</hi><hi rend="superscript">1</hi>
                            <note n="5" xml:id="d122fn5"> In this passage the words in italics are,
                                in Mr. Bancroft’s Memorial, printed with widened spaces between the
                                letters, the mode of printing used in German to show emphasis,
                                corresponding to the use of italics in the printing of English. The
                                like observation applies to other passages cited in this Statement
                                from Mr. Bancroft’s Memorial.</note></p>
                        <p>The form of expression requires little explanation. Lord Aberdeen
                            naturally dwelt on the most prominent part of the arrangement which Mr.
                            Pakenham was to propose, namely, the securing the possession to this
                            country of the whole of Vancouver’s Island. He referred only to the
                            broad geographical features, the mention of which was supposed to be
                            sufficient for the matter under discussion. There is nothing in his
                            words to exclude any additional advantage which the terms of the project
                            of the Treaty would give to this country, and more (it is plain) the
                            project did give.</p>
                        <p>*16. Mr. Bancroft further cites (page 20) a passage from a report of a
                            speech of Sir Robert Peel in the House of Commons:<seg type="margin"
                                >[5]</seg></p>
                        <p>Those who remember the local conformation of that country will understand
                            that that which we proposed is the continuation of the forty-ninth
                            parallel of latitude till it strikes the Straits of Fuca; that that
                            parallel should not be continued as a boundary across Vancouver’s
                            Island, thus depriving us of a part of Vancouver’s Island, but that the
                            middle of the channel shall be the future boundary, thus <hi
                                rend="italic">leaving us in possession of the whole of Vancouver’s
                                Island</hi>, with equal right to the navigation of the Straits.</p>
                        <p>It can scarcely be seriously contended that, because Sir Robert Peel,
                            describing in a popular way the effect of the Treaty, spoke of it as
                            leaving us in possession of the whole of Vancouver’s Island, this <pb
                                n="199" xml:id="pg_199" facs="0229"/>amounts to a declaration by him
                            that the effect of the Treaty is to exclude us from any possession other
                            than Vancouver’s Island, although lying within the future boundary,
                            which he in the same breath specifies accurately as the middle of the
                            channel.</p>
                        <p>17. In connection with the reference to Sir Robert Peel’s speech, Mr.
                            Bancroft (page 20) says:</p>
                        <p>Sir Robert Peel quoted from a dispatch which proved that he was aware of
                            the three days’ debate in the American Senate on the Treaty before its
                            approval.</p>
                        <p>Here, as in some other parts of Mr. Bancroft’s Memorial, it is difficult
                            to discover the object of statements made by him, but not put into an
                            argumentative form. The object of this statement would seem, from the
                            context, to be to suggest that Sir Robert Peel was at this time
                            cognizant of the particulars of a speech of Mr. Benton, a Senator of the
                            United States, made in the Senate (referred to just before by Mr.
                            Bancroft and to be particularly considered hereafter in this Statement.)
                            If this is the suggestion meant, there are three answers to it:</p>
                        <p>(i.) The deliberation of the Senate, reported in Mr. Pakenham’s dispatch,
                            read in part by Sir Robert Peel, was not the debate in which Mr.
                            Benton’s speech was made. The dispatch relates to the deliberation
                            consequent on the preliminary Message of the President, asking the
                            advice of the Senate, not to the debate on the ratification. It was the
                            latter debate in the course of which Mr. Benton’s speech was made.</p>
                        <p>(ii.) Even if Mr. Benton’s speech had been spoken before Mr. Pakenham’s
                            dispatch, and the fact had been mentioned therein, there would still be
                            no force in Mr. Bancroft’s suggestion, inasmuch as the debates in the
                            Senate were secret, and the injunction of secrecy was not removed until
                            after the date of the exchange of ratifications in London.<hi

                                newspaper published at Baltimore.)</note></p>
                        <p>(iii.) The dispatch of Mr. Pakenham (of which the part relating to this
                            matter is printed by Mr. Bancroft in the extract from Sir Robert Peel’s
                            speech in Appendix No. 46 to the Memorial) gives no information as to
                            the name of any speaker, or the particulars of any speech, in the
                            Senate. It simply says:<hi rend="superscript">2</hi>
                            <note n="7" xml:id="d122fn7"> Historical note, p. xix.</note></p>
                        <p>After a few hours’ deliberation on each of the three days, Wednesday,
                            Thursday, and Friday, the Senate, by a majority of 38 votes to 12,
                            adopted yesterday evening a resolution advising the President to accept
                            the terms proposed by Her Majesty’s Government.</p>
                        <p>*It is clear, therefore, that Sir Robert Peel had not at the time of
                            speaking (if he ever had) any knowledge of what was said by Mr. Benton
                            in the Senate. If this is not the point of Mr. Bancroft’s reference to
                            the debate in the Senate, Her Majesty’s Government do not know why the
                            reference is made.<seg type="margin">[6]</seg></p>

                        <p>18. The third division of Mr. Bancroft’s arguments comprises his
                            endeavors to shew that there is evidence, contemporaneous with the
                            making of the Treaty, in support of the contention of the United States.

                        <pb n="200" xml:id="pg_200" facs="0230"/>
                        <p>With this knowledge of Mr. MacLane’s character, and of the confidence
                            reposed in him by Lord Aberdeen, I request the Imperial Arbitrator to
                            take in hand the map of the Oregon Territory by Wilkes, which had been
                            published in England as well as in America in 1845, and which was the
                            latest, most authentic, and best map of the territory, as well as the
                            only one recognized by the American Senate, and, with this map in hand,
                            to read the following extract from Mr. MacLane’s official report of the
                            interview, made on the 18th of May, 1846:</p>
                        <p>“I have now to state that instructions will be transmitted to Mr.
                            Pakenham by the steamer of to-morrow to submit a new and further
                            proposition on the part of this Government, for a partition of the
                            territory in dispute.</p>
                        <p>“The proposition, most probably, will offer substantially:</p>
                        <p>“First, to divide the territory by the extension of the line on the
                            parallel of forty-nine to the sea, that is to say, to the arm of the sea
                            called Birch’s Bay, thence <hi rend="italic">by the Canal de Arro and
                                Straits of Fuca to the ocean.”</hi> * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>Here follow other clauses, conceding to the Hudson’s Bay Company a
                            temporary use of the Oregon River for navigation, with other advantages,
                            and protection to British subjects who would suddenly come under the
                            jurisdiction of the United States. To these clauses the phrase “most
                            probably” applies, for they were not precisely ascertained; but not to
                            the boundary: on that point the further statement of Mr. MacLane in the
                            same dispatch leaves no room for a doubt. His words are: “During the
                            preceding Administration of our Government, the extension of the line on
                            the forty-ninth parallel to the Straits of Fuca, <hi rend="italic">as
                                now proposed by Lord Aberdeen</hi>, <hi rend="italic">was actually
                                suggested by my immediate predecessor</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Mr.
                                Everett</hi>) as one he thought his Government might accept.”</p>
                        <p>Now what the proposal of Mr. Everett had been we know from the citations
                            which I have made from his dispatches; and I have actually referred to
                            the fact that he had drawn the line of demarkation on the map, and
                            specially directed the attention of Lord Aberdeen to it.</p>
                        <p>19. In this passage Mr. Bancroft puts forward prominently Mr. MacLane’s
                            letter, but he nowhere deduces distinctly the inference he wishes the
                            Arbitrator to draw from it. In whatever light, however, the letter is
                            regarded, it will appear that, when all the circumstances are candidly
                            considered, the letter furnishes no ground for any inference favorable
                            to the United States in the present discussion.</p>
                        <p>(i.) Mr. MacLane does not profess in his letter to report the words of
                            the contemplated Treaty. He had seen the words, and knew that the Canal
                            de Haro was not specified. He must then (it would seem) have considered
                            the words he saw as amounting substantially (according to his own
                            expression) to the proposal of a line by the Canal de Haro. He applied
                            (whether accurately or not is not the question) his geographical
                            information to the words shown to him, and inferred in his own mind that
                            a line such as he saw described would run through the Canal de Haro.
                            Under this impression he wrote to his Government. If this is the true
                            explanation of the facts, (and no other explanation is apparent,) his
                            statement is of no weight on the question, what is the channel of the
                            Treaty. That question, which is the question now under arbitration,
                            remains unaffected by his letter.</p>
                        <p>* (ii.) One circumstance in Mr. MacLane’s letter tends to support this
                            explanation, that is, his mention of Birch Bay, (incorrectly called by
                            him Birch’s Bay,) which he treats as being on the forty-ninth parallel.
                            This geographical error (which is peculiar in this controversy to Mr.
                            MacLane) has been accounted for thus by Mr. Archibald Campbell:<hi

                        <p>Mr. MacLane, in tracing on the map the forty-ninth parallel “to the sea,
                            that is to say, <hi rend="italic">the arm of the sea</hi> called Birch’s
                            Bay,” evidently supposed that the space between <pb n="201"
                                xml:id="pg_201" facs="0231"/>the Continent and Vancouver’s Island at
                            the forty-ninth parallel was designated as Birch Bay. And from the
                            conspicuous position given to the name of Birch Bay on Wilkes’s map, and
                            even on Vancouver’s chart, such an error might very naturally occur. In
                            reality, however, Birch Bay is only the small indentation on the
                            main-land at the extreme right of the name, and is a few miles south of
                            the forty-ninth parallel. The name of the <hi rend="italic">Gulf of
                                Georgia</hi> is intended by Wilkes to extend from the parallel of
                            50° as far south as the northern extremity of the Canal de Haro,
                            including the space supposed by Mr. MacLane to be Birch Bay.</p>
                        <p>This explanation is simple and reasonable, and it strongly confirms the
                            suggestion of Her Majesty’s Government that Mr. MacLane was merely
                            interpreting, according to his own lights, the words of the project
                            which Lord Aberdeen had shown him, and was not reporting to his
                            Government Lord Aberdeen’s interpretation, or an agreed interpretation.
                            There is no suggestion, and no ground for a suggestion, that Lord
                            Aberdeen ever spoke of Birch Bay. If, then, it is probable that Mr.
                            MacLane did not derive from Lord Aberdeen his mention of Birch Bay, in
                            just the same degree is it probable that he did not derive from Lord
                            Aberdeen his mention of the Canal de Haro.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>
                            <note n="9" xml:id="d122fn9"> There is nothing in the explanation here
                                given of Mr. MacLane’s words inconsistent with the character of him
                                drawn by Mr. Bancroft, (page 18:) “Mr. MacLane was a calm and
                                experienced statesman, trained in business, exact in his use of
                                words, careful especially in reporting what was said by
                                others.”</note></p>
                        <p>(iii.) The use by Mr. MacLane of Wilkes’s map (which is thus made almost
                            certain) goes far to account for his mention of the Canal de Haro, (or
                            Arro, as it is written on Wilkes’s map, and by Mr. MacLane,) for that
                            passage is so conspicuously marked on Wilkes’s map as to seem to be the
                            only direct channel between the Continent and Vancouver’s Island leading
                            into the Straits of Fuca. But, however it is to be accounted for, there
                            is no ground whatever for the suggestion that Mr. MacLane’s mention of
                            the Canal de Haro was authorized by anything said to him by Lord
                            Aberdeen.</p>
                        <p>(iv.) In 1859 Lord Aberdeen, on being referred to by Lord John Russell,
                            then Her Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,
                            informed Lord John Russell that he (Lord Aberdeen) distinctly remembered
                            the general tenor of his conversations with Mr. MacLane on the subject
                            of the Oregon boundary, and he had no recollection of any mention having
                            been made during the discussion of the Canal de Haro, or, indeed, any
                            other channel than those described in the Treaty itself.<hi

                        <p>(v.) Mr. MacLane was not negotiating with Lord Aberdeen. His connection
                            with the question was (as he himself says) “in a great degree
                                informal.”<hi rend="superscript">3</hi>

                                with reference to the time just before the Treatv: “Meantime the
                                negotiation on the Oregon question had been transferred to the new
                                British Minister at Washington.” And again, (page 16:) “Lord
                                Aberdeen confessed that it now fell to him to propose a peaceful
                                solution of the long controversy.”</note> *Lord Aberdeen was at
                            liberty to inform Mr. MacLane of his views and intentions; he was at
                            liberty to refrain from doing so. Anything that passed between Lord
                            Aberdeen and Mr. MacLane was not negotiation in a proper sense, and no
                            binding compact can be extracted from it, taken alone.<seg type="margin"

                        <p>(vi.) Mr. MacLane perfectly understood this position. Lord Aberdeen’s
                            project of Treaty was so far from being the result of a bargain made
                            between him and Mr. MacLane, that Mr. MacLane in reporting it to his <pb
                                n="202" xml:id="pg_202" facs="0232"/>Government disapproved of it,
                            and (it would appear) tried to induce his Government to reject it.<hi

                        <p>It is scarcely necessary for me to state that the proposition as now
                            submitted has not received my countenance. Although it has been no easy
                            task, under all the circumstances, to lead to a re-opening of the
                            negotiations by any proposition from this Government, and to induce it
                            to adopt the parallel of 49 as tire basis of a boundary, nevertheless I
                            hoped it would have been in my power to give the present proposition a
                            less objectionable shape, and I most deeply lament my inability to
                            accomplish it. I have, therefore, felt it my duty to discourage any
                            expectation that it would be accepted by the President; or, if submitted
                            to that body, approved by the Senate.</p>
                        <p>(vii.) If Mr. MacLane had been in a position to enter into a contract
                            with Lord Aberdeen it is plain he never would have used the
                            qualification “most probably.” Mr. Bancroft, seeing the force of this
                            consideration, endeavors to get over the difficulty by alleging that the
                            phrase “most probably” applies, not to the boundary, but to the other
                            parts of Lord Aberdeen’s proposal; for, he says, those other parts “were
                            not precisely ascertained.” Mr. MacLane’s letter (as far as it relates
                            to the Oregon question) is printed in the Historical Note, and is open
                            to the judgment of the Arbitrator. It appears to Her Majesty’s
                            Government to afford no ground to justify this limited application of
                            the phrase “most probably.” This phrase is in immediate connection,
                            grammatically, and in the arrangement of the matter, with the passage
                            relating to the boundary. The three subjects, (1,) boundary; (2,)
                            possessory rights of British subjects; (3,) navigation of the Columbia,
                            are discussed throughout the letter on the same footing. The proposal on
                            any one subject is treated in the letter as being quite as much settled
                            and definitive as the proposal on any other. Moreover, in point of fact,
                            the exact proposal was as much ascertained on any one point as on any
                            other, and this must have been so in Mr. MacLane’s apprehension, as Lord
                            Aberdeen had shown him the project of the Treaty.</p>
                        <p>(viii.) The boundary, however, it is argued by Mr. Bancroft, was
                            precisely ascertained, because Mr. MacLane states that the line as
                            proposed by Lord Aberdeen had been suggested by Mr. Everett, and what
                            the proposal of Mr. Everett was (he says) is known from the citations in
                            the Memorial from his (Mr. Everett’s) dispatches. The passage in Mr.
                            Bancroft’s Memorial, relating to Mr. Everett’s suggestion, is as
                            follows, (page 11:)</p>
                        <p>On the 29th of November, 1843, soon after Mr. Everett’s full powers had
                            arrived, he and Lord Aberdeen had a very long and important conversation
                            on the Oregon question; and the concessions of Lord Aberdeen appearing
                            to invite an expression of the extremest modification which the United
                            States could admit to their former proposal, Mr. Everett reports that he
                            said: “I thought the President might be induced so far to depart from
                            the forty-ninth parallel as to leave the whole of Quadra and Vancouver’s
                            Island to England, whereas that line of latitude would give us the
                            southern extremity of that island, and consequently the command of the
                            Straits of Fuca on both sides. I then <hi rend="italic">pointed out on a

                            would take it into consideration.”</p>
                        <p>The next day Mr. Everett more formally referred to the subject in a note
                            to the British Secretary:</p>

                            <p>On the 2d of February, and on the 1st of April, 1844, Mr. Everett
                                reports that he continuously insisted with Lord Aberdeen that the
                                only modification which the United States could, in his opinion, be
                                brought to agree to, was that they should waive their claim to the
                                southern extremity of Vancouver’s Island, and that Lord Aberdeen
                                uniformly answered, “he did not think there would he much difficulty
                                in settling the question.”</p>
                            <p>During the following months Mr. Everett and Lord Aberdeen, both
                                wishing sincerely to settle the controversy, had further frequent
                                conversations, and, as the result of them all, Mr. Everett reported
                                that England would not accept the naked parallel of 49° to the
                                ocean, hut would consent to the line of the forty-ninth degree,
                                provided it could be so modified as to leave to Great Britain the
                                southern extremity of Vancouver Island. “I have spared no pains,”
                                wrote Mr. Everett on the 28th of February, 1845, “to impress upon
                                Lord Aberdeen’s mind the persuasion that the utmost which the United
                                States, can concede is the forty-ninth parallel with the
                                modification suggested, taking always care to add that I had no
                                authority for saying that even that modification would be agreed
                                to.”</p>
                            <p>To one fact I particularly invoke the attention of the Imperial
                                Arbitrator: not the least room for doubt was left by Mr. Everett
                                with regard to the extent of the modification proposed. <hi
                                    rend="italic">He had pointed it out to Lord Aberdeen on the

                                of the proposed concession.</p>
                            <p>It is difficult to see the force of this reference from the letter of
                                Mr. MacLane to the writings and acts of Mr. Everett. It seems to Her
                                Majesty’s Government to be a process of ascertaining a thing
                                uncertain in itself by means of something still more uncertain. It
                                does not appear that Mr. Everett pointed out on a map, or referred
                                in any manner to, the Canal de Haro; yet this is the whole question.
                                The fair inference from Mr. Everett’s statements is that he did not
                                speak of the water boundary at all, but only pointed out on a map
                                how much of Vancouver’s Island would be cut off by the forty-ninth
                                parallel. Mr. Bancroft appears to overstrain Mr. Everett’s words.
                                Mr. Everett says he “pointed out on a map the extent of the
                                concession,” as regards the southern extremity of Vancouver’s
                                Island; Mr. Bancroft says (page 19) Mr. Everett “had drawn the line
                                of demarkation upon the map,” which seems to be a very different
                                thing. If this had been stated by Mr. Everett, and if it also
                                appeared that the line of demarkation drawn by him on the map passed
                                down the Canal de Haro, then Mr. Bancroft’s inference that Lord
                                Aberdeen was proposing a line through the Canal de Haro, from the
                                fact that Mr. MacLane says that the line proposed by Lord Aberdeen
                                had been suggested by Mr. Everett, would not be so remote orso weak
                                as it is.</p>
                            <p>(ix.) The statements of Mr. MacLane to his own Government can in no
                                way bind Her Majesty’s Government. Mr. MacLane does not say that he
                                did, and there is no evidence that he did, ever specify any channel
                                in his conversations with Lord Aberdeen. There is no evidence that
                                he ever told Lord Aberdeen what he was going to report to his
                                Government. The presumption to be drawn from Lord Aberdeen’s
                                dispatch of 29th June, 1846, to Mr. Pakenham, is to the contrary.<hi

                                Mr. Pakenham. There is no suggestion that Mr. Buchanan communicated
                                to Mr. Pakenham *Mr. MacLane’s letter. On the contrary, it is
                                evident from Mr. Pakenham’s dispatch of the 29th July, 1846, that
                                the letter was unknown to him till its unauthorized publication, as

                                    to United States Secretary of State. Appendix No. 1.</note>
                                written in 1858, Sir Richard (formerly Mr.) Pakenham states that Mr.
                                Buchanan on the occasion of the Treaty “made no mention whatever of
                                the Canal de Haro as that through which the line of boundary should
                                run as understood by the United States Government.” If, indeed, Mr.
                                Buchanan had done so, that mere fact would be of no importance as
                                against Her Majesty’s Government. Mr. Pakenham was acting under
                                strict instructions. If Mr. Buchanan had indicated the Canal de Haro
                                as the boundary channel, Mr. Pakenham could only have answered as he
                                did on the question of the effect of Article II, namely, the Article
                                speaks for itself.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi>

                                had no power to modify the project of Treaty in substance, and no
                                power to bind his Government by assenting to or acquiescing in an
                                interpretation which would have been equivalent to a serious
                                    modification.<seg type="margin">[10]</seg></p>
                            <p>20. It appears to Her Majesty’s Government that this examination of
                                Mr. MacLane’s letter justifies them in submitting to the Arbitrator
                                that the letter affords no support to the contention of the United
                                States.</p>
                            <p>21. In addition to Mr. MacLane’s letter, Mr. Bancroft refers to the
                                speech of Mr. Benton in the Senate before mentioned. The passage in
                                Mr. Bancroft’s Memorial is as follows, (page 19:)</p>
                            <p>A suspicion of ambiguity could not lurk in the mind of any one. Mr.
                                Benton found the language so clear that he adopted it as his own. In
                                his Speech in the Senate on the day of the ratification of the
                                Treaty, he said:</p>
                            <p>“The first Article of the Treaty is <hi rend="italic">in the very
                                    words</hi> which I myself would have used if the two Governments
                                had left it to me to draw the boundary line between them * * * * * *
                                *</p>
                            <p>“The line established by the first Article follows the parallel of
                                49° to the sea, with a slight deflection through the Straits of Fuca
                                    <hi rend="italic">to avoid cutting off the south end of
                                    Vancouver’s Island</hi> * * *. When the line reaches the channel
                                which separates Vancouver’s Island from the Continent, it proceeds
                                to the middle of the channel, and thence turning south <hi
                                    rend="italic">through the Channel de Haro</hi> (wrongly written
                                Arro on the maps) to the Straits of Fuca, and then west through the
                                middle of that Strait to the sea. This gives us * * * * the <hi
                                    rend="italic">cluster of islands</hi> between <hi rend="italic"

                            <p>22. Her Majesty’s Government submit that the speech of Mr. Benton is
                                even of less value, as evidence in support of the contention of the
                                United States, than is Mr. MacLane’s letter.</p>
                            <p>(i.) It seems probable that Mr. Benton founded his exposition of the
                                draught Treaty on Mr. MacLane’s letter,<hi rend="superscript">3</hi>
                                <note n="20" xml:id="d122fn20"> This was Sir Richard Pakenham’s

                                only a reflection of Mr. MacLane’s.</p>
                            <p>(ii.) Mr. Benton may indeed have formed his opinion not directly on
                                Mr. MacLane’s letter, but on the same sort of ground on which it
                                would appear Mr. MacLane’s statement was made, namely, a knowledge
                                (whether complete or accurate, or not) of the local conditions.<hi

                                <note n="21" xml:id="d122fn21"> Mr. Cass describes Mr. Benton as
                                    being “better acquainted, perhaps, than any other member [of the
                                    Senate] with the geography of the region in dispute.”—To Mr.

                                case his statement would amount to no more than a declaration of
                                *his opinion that, on the true construction of the words of the
                                Treaty, the line described would run down the Canal de Haro. But Mr.
                                Benton’s opinion on this question of construction is not alleged to
                                be of any special value, and its authority in the present discussion
                                is <pb n="205" xml:id="pg_205" facs="0235"/>not admitted. The
                                question whether or not the line runs down the Canal de Haro,
                                according to the construction of the Treaty, is the question before
                                the Arbitrator.<seg type="margin">[11]</seg></p>
                            <p>(iii.) But whatever was the foundation of Mr. Benton’s observations,
                                and whatever title they have to consideration, Her Majesty’s
                                Government cannot be affected either through Mr. Pakenham or through
                                Lord Aberdeen by anything that was said on this occasion in the
                                Senate. The debates in the Senate were in Secret Session. No
                                publication of them was permitted or made until after the time when

                            <p>23. Mr. Bancroft adduces no further evidence whatever on this point,
                                yet he goes so far as to say, (page 20:)</p>
                            <p>The language of the Treaty seemed perfectly clear to the Senate, to
                                the President, to his Secretary of State, and to every one of his
                                constitutional advisers, as departing from the line of the parallel
                                of 49° only so far as to yield the southern extremity of Vancouver’s
                                Island, and no more.</p>

                                time by the Senate (as a body) or by the President, or by any one of
                                the President’s constitutional advisers other than his Secretary of

                                Bancroft’s Memorial, but because, in the course of the controversy
                                between the two Governments, a statement respecting Mr. Buchanan’s
                                opinion has been made on behalf of the United States. It has been

                                was presented to Mr. Buchanan by Mr. Pakenham, Mr. Buchanan mentions
                                the Canal de Haro as the channel intended by the Treaty. This letter
                                has not been seen by Her Majesty’s Government. It may be supposed
                                that it is simply (so to speak) an echo of Mr. MacLane’s conjectures
                                as to what would be found to be the substantial effect of Lord
                                Aberdeen’s proposal, when it came to be worked out. But whether that
                                is so or not, statements passing between Mr. Buchanan and Mr.
                                MacLane, not communicated to Mr. Pakenham or to Lord Aberdeen, are
                                not admissible as against Her Majesty’s Government. Sir Richard
                                Pakenham, in his Memorandum before cited, says:</p>
                            <p>It is certain that Mr. Buchanan signed the Treaty with Mr. MacLane’s
                                dispatch before him, and yet that he made no mention whatever of the
                                Canal de Haro as that through which the line of boundary should run,

                                any, weight. All that it amounts to is this, that some of the
                                persons concerned on the part of the United States, on the occasion
                                of the Treaty, anticipated that the Treaty, couched in the words
                                proposed on one side and adopted on the other, would have a certain
                                effect. These anticipations were not communicated at the time to Her
                                Majesty’s Government, or to any representative of that Government,
                                and are, therefore, in no degree binding on them to their

                                Mr. Buchanan inclosed, in a letter to Mr. Bancroft, a traced copy of

                                the United States, it ought to be rejected. First, it was from its
                                nature entirely unknown at its dates to Her Majesty’s Government;
                                secondly, any declarations it contains were made <hi rend="italic"

                                correspondence explicitly rest. Mr. Buchanan does not use a word
                                that can fairly be considered as conveying his personal testimony as
                                to the intention of himself or his Government at the time of the
                                making of the Treaty. Finally, if this correspondence is admitted as
                                evidence, then Her Majesty’s Government would ask that there be

                                of a letter from Mr. Bancroft to Mr. Buchanan, describing a
                                conversation which he (Mr. Bancroft) had had with Lord Palmerston.
                                No statement of Mr. Bancroft made more than two years after the
                                exchange of ratifications can be reasonably regarded as “personal
                                testimony contemporaneous with the Treaty,” in which category it is
                                placed in the paper of Mr. Cass adducing it. The only use to which
                                these documents could now be fairly applied would be to show that
                                Lord Palmerston had then made to Mr. Bancroft admissions now binding
                                on Her Majesty’s Government. But the documents afford no ground for
                                such a suggestion.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>

                                    on record what, no doubt, Mr. Bancroft duly reported to his
                                    Government at the time, namely, that Lord Palmerston gave Mr.

                                    did not acquiesce in the pretensions of the United States that
                                    the boundary line should be run down the Haro Channel.”—Lord

                                he for the second time intimated his view that the boundary was to
                                pass through the Canal de Haro) is conclusive as to Lord
                                Palmerston’s view of the position. It is plain, on the face of Lord
                                Palmerston’s answer to that letter, that the answer was deliberately
                                framed so as not to amount to an admission of the claim put forward
                                by Mr. Bancroft. If there could be any doubt of this, on the words
                                of the letter, the doubt would be put an end to by a reference to
                                the minutes on Mr. Bancroft’s letter which preceded the preparation
                                of the draught of Lord Palmerston’s answer. On Mr. Bancroft’s letter
                                the Under-Secretary of State made the following minute for Lord
                                    Palmerston:<seg type="margin">[13]</seg></p>
                            <p>Shall this letter he acknowledged and Mr. Bancroft he thanked for it?

                                over without observation?</p>
                            <p>The underlined words were, “through the middle of which our boundary

                                those passages in which he contends, in effect, that Her Majesty’s
                                Government are precluded from disputing the interpretation put on
                                the Treaty by the United States, on the ground that the framing of
                                the Treaty was (as he represents) the work of Her Majesty’s
                                Government.</p>
                            <p>27. He says, (page 22:)</p>
                            <p>The draught of the Treaty was made entirely, even to the minutest
                                word, by the British Ministry, and was signed by both parties
                                without change. The British Government cannot, therefore, take
                                advantage of an ambiguity of their own, otherwise the draught of the
                                Treaty would have been a snare. Such is the principle of natural
                                right, such the established law of nations. Hugo Grotius lays down
                                the rule that the interpretation must be made against, the party
                                which draughted the conditions: “Ut contra eum fiat interpretatio,
                                qui conditiones elocutus est.” But no one has expressed this more
                                clearly than Vattel, who writes: * * *</p>
                            <p>*28. Her Majesty’s Government submit that the fact that the project
                                of the Treaty emanated from them can be in no way used to their
                                disadvantage. The Treaty, as it comes before the Arbitrator, <pb
                                    n="208" xml:id="pg_208" facs="0238"/>must be regarded as the
                                work of both parties. It was in the power of the President or of the
                                Senate of the United States to insist on any alteration of the
                                terms. They had abundant opportunity for considering the terms. The
                                project was delivered by Mr. Pakenham to Mr. Buchanan, and
                                considered by them in conference, on the 6th of June. It was sent by
                                the President to the Senate on the 10th of June. It was considered
                                by the Senate on the 10th, 11th, and 12th of June. The Treaty was
                                signed on the 15th of June. It was sent to the Senate for
                                ratification on the 16th of June. The Treaty, with various
                                incidental motions, was before the Senate on the 16th, 17th, and
                                18th of June. Mr. Buchanan intimated to Mr. Pakenham that the
                                President’s message sending the project to the Senate might, and
                                probably would, suggest some modifications in it. An entire counter
                                proposal was made and divided on in the Senate; in the preliminary
                                deliberation a formal motion was divided on for adding a proviso to
                                Article II; and Mr. Buchanan made representations to Mr. Pakenham

                                (first) on the ground of the delay that would be caused, which would
                                be injurious to the in terests, particularly the commercial
                                interests, of the United States; and (secondly) because of the
                                importance to the United States of closing the question, as they
                                were then engaged in war with the Republic of Mexico. In all these
                                circumstances, the words of the Treaty must be taken to be, as they
                                in fact are, the words, not of Lord Aberdeen and Mr. Pakenham only,
                                but the words also of Mr. Buchanan and of the President and Senate
                                of the United States.<seg type="margin">[14]</seg></p>
                            <p>29. The words cited by Mr. Bancroft from Grotius’s book are not
                                applicable to the present case. The passage from which they are
                                extracted relates to the case of dictation of conditions of peace.
                                The whole chapter to which they belong is on that and cognate
                                subjects. The sentence from which Mr. Bancroft’s citation is taken
                                reads in a more complete form thus:</p>
                            <p>In dubio autem sensu magis est ut contra eum fiat interpretation, qui
                                conditiones elocutus est, quod esse solet potentioris: est ejus qui
                                dat non qui petit conditiones pacis dare [dicere,] ait Annibal.</p>
                            <p>The passage produced by Mr. Bancroft from Vattel’s work appears to
                                Her Majesty’s Government to be as capable of an application
                                favorable to them as of one unfavorable to them.</p>
                            <p>30. In another place (page 30) Mr. Bancroft says:</p>
                            <p>A party offering the draught of a Treaty is bound by the
                                interpretation which it knew at the time that the other party gave
                                it. Lord Aberdeen cannot have doubted how the Treaty was understood
                                by Mr. MacLane, by Mr. Buchanan, and by the Senate of the United
                                States. “Where the terms of promise,” writes Paley, whose work was
                                long a text-book at Oxford, “admit of more senses than one, the
                                promise is to be performed in the sense in which the promiser
                                apprehended at the time that the promisee received it. This will not
                                differ from the actual intention of the promiser, where the promise
                                is given without collusion or reserve; but we put the rule in the
                                above form to exclude evasion, wherever the promiser attempts to
                                make his escape through some ambiguity in the expressions which he
                                used.”</p>
                            <p>*Her Majesty’s Government are not here concerned to dispute the
                                general proposition that a party offering to another the draught of
                                a Treaty is bound by the interpretation which it (the party
                                offering) knew at the time the other party gave to the draught. But
                                they do dispute, and submit they have disproved, Mr. Bancroft’s
                                particular proposition. <pb n="209" xml:id="pg_209" facs="0239"
                                />Lord Aberdeen (he says) cannot have doubted bow the Treaty was
                                understood by Mr. MacLane, by Mr. Buchanan, and by the Senate of the
                                United States. Her Majesty’s Government have proved that Lord
                                Aberdeen did not know until after the exchange of ratifications (if
                                personally he ever knew) of Mr. MacLane’s letter to Mr. Buchanan, of
                                Mr. Buchanan’s letter to Mr. MacLane,<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>

                                Mr. Benton’s speech (the views expressed in which Mr. Bancroft seems

                            <p>31. The doctrine contained in the passage cited by Mr. Bancroft from
                                Dr. Paley’s treatise on Moral and Political Philosophy appears to
                                Her Majesty’s Government generally true,<hi rend="superscript"

                                <note n="35" xml:id="d122fn35"> It is, however, not altogether
                                    unimpeachable, as will appear from the criticisms of another
                                    English author, Austin, Lectures on Jurisprudence, vol. ii. p.
                                    122.</note> but here irrelevant. That doctrine applies to a
                                promise in the ordinary sense, a unilateral promise, or an
                                engagement taken by one party wholly or mainly. It is not
                                appropriate to the case of a contract, which the same treatise
                                defines as a mutual promise. A few pages further in that treatise,
                                the following is stated as “a rule which governs the construction of
                                all contracts:”</p>
                            <p>Whatever is expected by one side, and known to be so expected by the
                                other, is to be deemed a part or condition of the contract.</p>
                            <p>This rule Her Majesty’s Government submit to be judged by. Even if it
                                were admitted (as it is not) that Mr. Bancroft has shown what
                                amounts (in the phraseology of Dr. Paley) to an expectation on the
                                side of the United States, he has entirely failed to show on the
                                other side (that of Her Majesty’s Government) a knowledge of the
                                existence of that expectation. On the contrary, Her Majesty’s
                                Government have demonstrated their necessary ignorance on the
                                point.</p>
                            <p>32. Sir Richard Pakenham (in his Memorandum before cited) says, (he
                                is writing some twelve years after the Treaty, and he speaks
                                therefore in guarded phrase, but his testimony is clear:)</p>
                            <p>I think I can safely assert that the Treaty of 15th June, 1846, was
                                signed and ratified without any intimation to us whatever on the
                                part of the United States Government as to the particular direction
                                to be given to the line of boundary contemplated by Article I of
                                that Treaty.</p>
                            <p rend="center">V.</p>
                            <p>33. It remains to examine the arguments by which Mr. Bancroft
                                endeavors to show that the language of the Treaty points to the
                                Canal de Haro and to that channel alone.</p>
                            <p>(i.) Mr. Bancroft refers (page 24) to the concise form of expression
                                by which, he says, in both countries the line was described as the
                                line of the “forty-ninth parallel and Fuca’s Straits.” Two
                                observations occur: (1) Many persons, including Mr. Greenhow, used
                                the name Fuca’s Straits to embrace the waters, or at least the
                                southern waters, of the Gulf of Georgia. (2) If, in this phrase, the
                                name is not so understood, then the use of this expression (the
                                forty-ninth parallel and Fuca’s Straits) is of no weight in favor of
                                Mr. Bancroft’s argument; for the whole question is where the line is
                                to run, which is required to form *a connecting link between the
                                forty-ninth parallel and Fuca’s Straits, (that name being used in
                                the modern sense.)<seg type="margin">[16]</seg></p>
                            <p>(ii.) Mr. Bancroft says, (page 25:)</p>
                            <p>When the Treaty speaks of “the channel,” for that part south and west
                                of Birch’s Bay, it must mean the Channel of Haro, for no other
                                “channel” was known to the negotiators.</p>
                            <pb n="210" xml:id="pg_210" facs="0240"/>
                            <p>And he proceeds to instance maps on which the Canal de Haro and no
                                other channel is named. This argument assumes that the reference in
                                the Treaty is necessarily to some named channel. Her Majesty’s
                                Government, on the contrary, have submitted that the absence of any
                                name in the Treaty is strong evidence in favor of their contention.
                                The fact that the Rosario Straits had no name specially fits that
                                passage to be the nameless channel of the Treaty. The Canal de Haro
                                was conspicuously named on Vancouver’s chart and Wilkes’s map. If it
                                had been intended to be the channel of the Treaty, it would have
                                been obvious and easy to name it. Mr. Bancroft can scarcely mean to
                                contend that the Rosario Straits are not a channel, because they do
                                not bear a name of which the word “channel” is part.</p>
                            <p>(iii.) Mr. Bancroft proceeds, (page 26:)</p>
                            <p>Again, the word “channel” when employed in Treaties, means a deep and
                                navigable channel, and when there are two navigable channels, by the
                                rule of international law, preference is to be given to the largest
                                column of water.</p>
                            <p>That the word “channel” means a navigable channel in Treaties
                                generally, and in the Treaty under consideration in particular, is
                                maintained also by Her Majesty’s Government. But they do not admit
                                the existence of such a rule as is here alleged. If navigability is
                                of the essence of a channel, then, as between two channels,
                                preference should be given to the one which is the better fitted for
                                navigation. Now, at the time when the Treaty was made, at which time
                                it must be read as speaking, the Canal de Haro was almost unknown to
                                and unused by practical navigators. It can scarcely, in the true
                                sense of language, regarded as used at that day, be called a
                                navigable channel. Even at the present day, when thoroughly explored
                                and surveyed, it is found to be of difficult and dangerous
                                navigation, especially for sailing-vessels, and only one steamer had
                                penetrated into those waters at the date of the Treaty.<hi

                            <p>(iv.) Then Mr. Bancroft says, (page 26:)</p>
                            <p>Now, compared with any other channel through which a ship could pass
                                from the sea at the forty-ninth parallel, to the Straits of Fuca,
                                the Channel of Haro is the broadest and the deepest, the shortest
                                and the best. * * * * With regard to depth, the contrast is still
                                more striking. * * * *</p>
                            <p>But, although depth of channel may be an advantage in river
                                navigation, and may therefore well weigh in the choice of one
                                channel as a boundary in preference to one or another less deep, yet
                                depth beyond a certain limit—a limit, perhaps, never reached in
                                river navigation—becomes a disadvantage in navigation of every kind,
                                as it lessens the facilities for anchoring, and thus increases the
                                dangers of navigation. The Canal de Haro is an instance. Its depth
                                is so great that there are but few anchorages in it, and there are
                                none in the main channel; and with this defect, and its rapid and
                                variable currents, it becomes an unsafe passage for sailing-vessels.
                                The Rosario Straits, on the other hand, while they are deep enough
                                for vessels of the very largest class, have many anchorages,
                                conveniently and securely situated; and at the same time the
                                regularity of the currents in them makes them comparatively easy of
                                navigation.</p>
                            <p>*(v.) Mr. Bancroft further says (page 26) that the Canal de Haro is
                                “the shortest and most direct way between the parallel of 49° and
                                Fuca Straits.” But there is nothing in the Treaty to show that the
                                line between the forty-ninth parallel and the Straits of Fuca is to
                                be run by what may now be held to be the shortest and most direct
                                    <pb n="211" xml:id="pg_211" facs="0241"/>way. The line is to be
                                drawn by the channel of the day, the ordinary and frequented
                                navigable channel.<seg type="margin">[17]</seg></p>
                            <p>(vi.) Mr. Bancroft, in favor of the Canal de Haro, says, (page 26,)
                                “Duflot de Mofras describes it as notoriously the best.” From this
                                and other references in the Memorial to this writer, it might be
                                supposed that he was entitled to high respect as an authority on the
                                hydrography and navigation of the region. The fact is he was
                                attached to a European Legation in Mexico in 1840–’42, and was sent
                                thence to report on the Oregon district and neighboring countries.
                                In his account he says, with regard to the difficulty of navigation
                                of these waters, that the Canal de Haro is “le passage le plus
                                facile.” He was not a naval officer, and appears to have been
                                employed solely in a civil capacity. Mr. Archibald Campbell, after
                                quoting the passage in which the observation referred to by Mr.
                                Bancroft is made, says:</p>
                            <p>And this opinion ho [Duflot de Mofras] must have derived from the
                                general report of those engaged in the navigation of these waters,
                                as his own explorations are con sidered very superficial.</p>
                            <p>It is plain that he has no personal authority on a question of
                                navigation.</p>
                            <p>(vii.) Mr. Bancroft contends (pages 27 and 29) that the Canal de Haro
                                is the only channel which separates the Continent from Vancouver’s
                                Island; that there are other passages which divide islands from
                                islands, but none other separates the Continent from Vancouver’s
                                Island; and that the Rosario Straits touch neither the Continent nor
                                Vancouver’s Island. But Her Majesty’s Government submit that, even
                                if the present state of knowledge is to be taken into account, the
                                distinctions here attempted are not tenable, as the map attached to
                                Mr. Bancroft’s Memorial shows. The Rosario Straits are, by the
                                evidence of that map in the respects here mentioned, as much
                                entitled as the Canal de Haro to be regarded as the dividing channel
                                between the Continent and the Island. But the question must be
                                referred back to the time of the Treaty, and then the Rosario
                                Straits will be the dividing channel, as being the ordinary track of
                                vessels passing up and down on the waters lying between the island
                                and the main-land.</p>
                            <p>(viii.) Mr. Bancroft (page 27) founds an argument on the word
                                “southerly;” but, as to this expression, there seems little room for
                                discussion. It is evidently used in a large and loose sense, as
                                contrasted with a line carried westward to the Pacific, or deflected
                                northward up the Gulf of Georgia. This is the more evident when it
                                is observed that, on a strict construction, the word is applied to
                                the continuation of the line through the Straits of Fuca, where its
                                direction would in fact be westerly, or even in part
                                northwesterly.</p>
                            <p>(ix.) Mr. Bancroft further says, (page 28:)</p>
                            <p>The Treaty contemplates a continuous channel to the Pacific; the
                                channel of Haro and Fuca’s Straits form such a continuous channel,
                                and a glance at the map will show that no other channel can pretend
                                to do so.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Bancroft’s map speaks for itself; it is difficult to see on it a
                                higher degree of continuity in the Canal de Haro than in Rosario
                                Straits. In fact the waters passing southerly through the Rosario
                                Straits are derived from the Gulf of Georgia alone and
                                uninterruptedly, while the Canal de Haro is in the southerly
                                direction supplied only partly and indirectly by the waters from the
                                southern termination of the Gulf of Georgia, and partly and more
                                directly from the waters flowing through the passages between
                                Vancouver’s Island and the archipelago off its eastern coast. This
                                is obvious on the map, and is <pb n="212" xml:id="pg_212"
                                    facs="0242"/>confirmed by observation. The flow of an
                                interrupted body of water from the Gulf of Georgia through the
                                Rosario Straits causes a marked regularity of current in *that
                                passage, while in the Canal de Haro, on the contrary, the currents
                                are irregular, the waters flowing into it being broken and dispersed
                                by the islands in and near its northern entrance.<seg type="margin"
                                    >[18]</seg></p>
                            <p>(x.) Mr. Bancroft labors the point (page 28) that the name Rosario
                                Straits was not given till of late to the channel through which
                                Vancouver sailed. Her Majesty’s Government are not concerned to
                                dispute this. But they have not invented the name of Rosario Straits
                                (as Mr. Bancroft seems to think) for the purposes of the present
                                discussion. Mr. Archibald Campbell gives a history of the names
                                borne at different times by the channel, ending thus: “It is now
                                [1859] universally called Rosario Straits.” It is, in fact, called
                                so over and over again in United States official documents, and it
                                had been named Rosario Strait on the map of the United States Coast
                                Survey (by Lieutenant Alden, United States Navy,) published in
                                1854.</p>
                            <p>(xi.) Lastly, Mr. Bancroft says, (page 29:)</p>
                            <p>Now, the so-called straits of Rosario lead only to a Sound, which
                                Spanish voyagers called the bay of Santa Rosa; they do not connect
                                with Fuca’s straits, which cease at the southeastern promontory of
                                Vancouver island.</p>
                            <p>Her Majesty’s Government submit that it is plain that Fuca’s Straits,
                                even in the more modern and restricted sense of that name, extend to
                                the western coast of Whidbey Island. Formerly, they used to be
                                considered, at least by many persons, including Mr. Greenhow, as
                                sweeping round to the north and northwest through the archipelago
                                which lies between the Canal de Haro and Rosario Straits, and as
                                including in their waters both those passages. On Quimper’s map,
                                indeed, the easternmost part of the Straits is marked Seno de Santa
                                Rosa. But that map (the earliest extant) is a very imperfect
                                representation of the land and water of the district, and the name
                                of the Bay of Santa Rosa never appears again on any map known to Her
                                Majesty’s Government.</p>
                            <p>34. In connection with this branch of the subject Her Majesty’s
                                Government desire to guard against an error that might be caused by
                                the map attached to Mr. Bancroft’s Memorial, (which may be taken as
                                a sample of the most modern maps.) This map represents a state of
                                geographical and hydrographical knowledge very different from that
                                which existed at the date of the Treaty. In one respect this
                                consideration is of great importance. The islands shown on this map,
                                forming a chain along the eastern coast of Vancouver’s Island, named
                                Galiano Island, Mayne Island, Samuel Island, and Saturna Island,
                                were at the date of the Treaty supposed by both Contracting Parties
                                to be parts of Vancouver’s Island. A comparison of maps of the date
                                of the Treaty with maps of the present day will show this
                                conclusively. Her Majesty’s Government adopt the words of Mr.
                                Archibald Campbell:</p>
                            <p>None of the maps extant at that day [the date of the Treaty] present
                                a perfectly correct idea of the space between the continent and
                                Vancouver’s Island, at, and immediately south of, the forty-ninth
                                parallel. The Straits of Fuca and the Archipelago east of the Canal
                                de Haro are fairly enough represented; but between the Haro
                                Archipelago and the forty-ninth parallel the space is inaccurately
                                represented as free from islands, and, consequently, with but a
                                single channel between the continent and Vancouver’s Island. The
                                surveys made subsequently to the conclusion of the Treaty show that
                                what was laid down by the early Spanish navigators, by Vancouver and
                                by Wilkes, as the eastern coast of Vancouver’s Island, is, in fact,
                                the coast of an extensive archipelago skirting the shore of the main
                                island between latitude 48° 47′ and 49° 10′.</p>
                            <p>Now, Her Majesty’s Government submit it to the Arbitrator as a clear
                                proposition that the Treaty is to be interpreted according to the
                                common <pb n="213" xml:id="pg_213" facs="0243"/> knowledge and
                                under*standing of the Contracting Parties at the time.<hi
                                    rend="superscript">1</hi>
                                <note n="37" xml:id="d122fn37"> Mr. Bancroft says, (page 5:) “Since
                                    the intention of the negotiators must rest on the knowledge in,
                                    their possession at the time when the Treaty was made, I shall
                                    use the charts and explorations which have advanced, or profess
                                    to have advanced, our knowledge of the country in question, and
                                    which are anterior to that date.”</note> Therefore, in
                                prolonging the forty-ninth parallel to the middle of the channel
                                between the Continent and Vancouver’s Island, and in drawing the
                                mid-channel line southerly therefrom to Fuca’s Straits, the
                                Arbitrator will have to consider the channel, at and immediately to
                                the southward of the forty-ninth parallel, as bounded on the west,
                                not by the eastern coast of Vancouver’s Island, as now ascertained,
                                but by the broken line of coast, which is, in fact, formed by the
                                eastern shores of Galiano Island and the other islands of that
                                    chain.<seg type="margin">[19]</seg></p>
                            <p>35. With reference to maps, another distinction requires notice. The
                                map spoken of as Wilkes’s map of the Oregon Territory (an extract of
                                which is Mr. Bancroft’s map F) is merely a map, in the ordinary
                                sense, and is not a chart with soundings marked or otherwise adapted
                                for purposes of navigation. <hi rend="superscript">2</hi>
                                <note n="38" xml:id="d122fn38"> There was no chart issued with the

                            <p>36. Mr. Bancroft speaks (page 28) of the place of a particular name
                                    “<hi rend="italic">on every map used by the negotiators</hi>.”
                                Who are meant by the negotiators does not appear. In the ordinary
                                sense, the negotiators were Mr. Pakenham and Mr. Buchanan. There is
                                no evidence known to Her Majesty’s Government of any particular map,
                                or of any map, having been used for the purposes of the negotiations
                                which issued immediately in the Treaty. There was a map before Mr.
                                Everett and Lord Aberdeen in one of their conversations, <hi

                                but what map does not appear. Mr. MacLane, it would seem, used

                                but there is no evidence that he and Lord Aberdeen together referred

                                probably used Vancouver’s chart, but it would rather seem that he

                                    this point: “Lord Aberdeen, in tracing the boundary line,
                                    follows the forty-ninth parallel to the sea-coast and deflects
                                    ‘thence in a southerly direction through the center of <hi
                                        rend="italic">King George’s Sound</hi> and the Straits of
                                    Fuca to the ocean.’ On either of the accompanying tracings, and
                                    indeed upon any map of the northwest coast, we may look in vain
                                    for ‘King George’s Sound’ between the Continent and Vancouver’s
                                    Island. This mistake is not so readily accounted for as Mr.
                                    MacLane’s in regard to Birch Bay, as the name is nowhere to be
                                    found on Vancouver’s chart, which is said to have been used by
                                    the British Government in reference to the water boundary. ‘King
                                    George’s Sound’ is the name that was given in 1778, by Captain
                                    Cook, to Nootka Sound, on the western coast of Vancouver’s
                                    Island, between latitude 49° and 50°. The name was never much in
                                    vogue, except to distinguish a mercantile association formed
                                    soon after the discovery of Nootka, called the ‘King George’s
                                    Sound Company.’ There is, however, no need of conjecture as to
                                    Lord Aberdeen’s actual meaning. He simply miscalled the Gulf of
                                    Georgia.”</note> and, in his statement to Lord John Russell in

                                was the intention of the Treaty to adopt the mid-channel of the
                                straits as the line of demarkation without any reference to islands,
                                the position, and, indeed, the very existence of which (he adds) had
                                hardly at that time been accurately ascertained.</p>

                            <p>37. Finally, it should be noted that the fact that the Canal de Haro
                                has long borne a proper name on the maps is no evidence of the
                                superiority of that passage for purposes *of navigation. It would
                                seem to have been accidentally distinguished by a name, before and
                                at the date of the treaty, from the circumstance that it obtained a
                                name (Canal de Lopez de Haro) on the Spanish map of Quimper’s
                                observations of the Straits of Fuca in 1790. <hi rend="superscript"

                                    eye-sketches, is of small value in itself. It describes itself
                                    as made by Quimper’s “primer piloto,” (first mate, or master.)
                                    Don Gon zalo Lopez de Haro. This fact may account for the
                                    prominence given to the channel bearing the name of Haro. But
                                    little more than the southern mouth of the channel is shown. The

                            <p>38. Her Majesty’s Government have now finished their examination of
                                Mr. Bancroft’s Memorial. They do not trouble the Arbitrator with any
                                remarks on such parts of it as refer to the Lecture or Pamphlet of
                                Mr. Sturgis, the observations of Mr. Bates, the articles in the
                                Quarterly Review and the Examiner, and other matters which seem to
                                them to have little (if any) bearing on the question to be decided.
                                The interpretation of the Treaty cannot be affected by the public
                                discussions which preceded it, nor can any amount of unofficial
                                declarations as to what ought to be done be evidence of what the
                                Governments of the two countries intended by the Treaty to do.</p>
                            <p>39. Nor have Her Majesty’s Government thought it necessary to examine
                                in detail the passage in the Memorial (page 23) which is headed
                                “Plea for the integrity of Sir Robert Peel’s Ministry,” or the
                                corresponding passage (page 31) which forms the concluding paragraph
                                of the Memorial. Her Majesty’s Government see no necessity for any
                                such plea, and no ground for the suggestions in the passage last
                                referred to. The characters of Sir Robert Peel and Lord Aberdeen
                                place them beyond suspicion of having acted with insincerity or
                                duplicity in any part of this transaction. Moreover, the frankness
                                with which Lord Aberdeen communicated to Mr. MacLane the project of
                                Treaty, in which no mention is made of the Canal de Haro as the
                                channel through which the boundary should run, sufficiently shows
                                that Mr. MacLane had no sure ground for his surmise that the Canal
                                de Haro was contemplated by Lord Aberdeen as the boundary channel,
                                or, at all events, was so at the time when Lord Aberdeen framed the
                                project of Treaty.</p>
                            <p>40. The Arbitrator will not fail to observe that the explanation
                                given in this Statement of the mention by Mr. MacLane and Mr. Benton
                                of the Canal de Haro, far from involving any dishonoring imputation,
                                is entirely consistent with the view, which Her Majesty’s Government
                                sincerely entertain, that Mr. MacLane, and all those who in any
                                degree represented the United States on the occasion of the Treaty,
                                acted with perfect good faith. Mr. MacLane, it seems almost certain,
                                misled himself by a misapplication of Wilkes’s map, and Mr. Benton
                                was misled either by Mr. MacLane’s letter, or by a misapplication of
                                his own geographical knowledge, or by both.</p>
                            <p>41. Her Majesty’s Government then submit to His Majesty the
                                Arbitrator, on the whole case, that, whether he looks at the general
                                position of the two nations with reference to their claims to the
                                Oregon district, or at the circumstances attending the *particular
                                transaction which issued in the Treaty, or at the language of the
                                Treaty, he will be led to adopt the conclusions of Her Majesty’s
                                    Government.<seg type="margin">[21]</seg></p>
                            <pb n="215" xml:id="pg_215" facs="0245"/>
                            <p>42. His Majesty the Arbitrator has been pleased to take on himself to
                                ascertain the channel of the Treaty, on the failure of the
                                Commissioners appointed by the two Governments to agree. In the
                                execution of this task, he has to look at the state of things as
                                they existed at the time of the Treaty. He has to determine through
                                which of the two channels, the Rosario Straits or the Canal de Haro,
                                the line ought to have been drawn by Commissioners appointed for the
                                purpose the day after the exchange of the ratifications.</p>
                            <p>43. The considerations, connected with the hydrography of the region
                                and with the history and existing conditions of the navigation of
                                its waters, on which, as Her Majesty’s Government submit, this
                                determination cannot fail to be in accordance with their
                                conclusions, are fully set forth in the Case presented by them to
                                the Arbitrator in December, 1871. The channel of the Treaty is that
                                one of the two channels in question which was the main navigable
                                channel, as known and used at the date of the Treaty. That channel
                                is the Rosario Straits.</p>

                        <p>In 1818 an agreement was come to between the Government of His Britannic
                            Majesty and that of the United States respecting the boundary line
                            between the British and United States territories in Northwestern
                            America.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed in substance that for the space extending from the Lake of
                            the Woods westward to the Rocky (then called the Stony) Mountains, the
                            boundary line should be the forty-ninth parallel of north latitude.</p>
                        <p>With respect to any country that might be claimed by either party on the
                            northwest coast, westward of the Rocky Mountains, it was agreed that for
                            ten years the same, with its harbors and the navigation of its rivers,
                            should be free and open to the vessels, citizens, and subjects of the
                            two Powers; with a proviso that the agreement was not to prejudice any
                            claim which either party might have to any part of that country.</p>
                        <p>This agreement was embodied in a Treaty made at London, 20th October,
                            1818.</p>
                        <p>The district between the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific, or part of it,
                            came to be known as Oregon or the Oregon Territory or district, the name
                            being taken from the Oregon River, now usually called the Columbia.</p>
                        <p>The northern boundary of this district, as it was in question between the
                            two Governments, was the parallel of 54° 40′ north latitude, being the
                            southern boundary of the Russian territory, as recognized by Treaty. The
                            southern boundary was the parallel of 42° north latitude, being the
                            northern boundary of the Spanish territory, as recognized by Treaty.</p>
                        <p>The British Plenipotentiaries who negotiated the Treaty of 1818 acceded
                            to the arrangement relating to the country west of the Rocky Mountains
                            in the hope that by thus leaving that country open to the trade of both
                            nations, they substantially secured every present advantage, while
                            removing all prospect of immediate collision, without precluding any
                            further discussion for a definite settlement. In their judgment the
                            American Plenipotentiaries were not authorized to admit any territorial
                            claim of Great Britain in that quarter to the southward of the Straits
                            of Fuca, although they would have consented to leave those straits and
                            the waters connected with them in the possession of Great Britain.</p>

                        <p>In 1824 negotiations were resumed for the settlement of questions between

                                n="218" xml:id="pg_218" facs="0248"/>maintained was derived not only
                            from discovery, but also from use, occupancy, and settlement. They
                            proposed that Article III *of the Treaty of London of 1818 should cease
                            to have effect, and that the boundary line west of the Rocky Mountains
                            should be drawn due west to the point where the forty-ninth parallel
                            strikes the great northeasternmost branch of the Oregon or Columbia
                            River, marked on the maps as McGillivray’s River, thence down along the
                            middle of that river, and down along the middle of the Oregon or
                            Columbia to its junction with the Pacific Ocean.<seg type="margin"

                        <p>The proposal of the United States Plenipotentiaries was to the effect
                            that the term of ten years limited in Article III of the Treaty of 1818
                            should be extended to ten years from the date of a new Treaty, but that
                            the rights of settlement and other rights should be restricted during
                            the new term, so that the citizens of the United States should form no
                            settlements to the north of the forty-ninth parallel, and that British
                            subjects should form no settlements to the south of that parallel, or to
                            the north of the fifty-fourth.</p>
                        <p>Terms were not agreed on, and the Conference came to an end in July,
                            1824.</p>
                        <p rend="center">1826, 1827.</p>
                        <p>In November, 1826, negotiations were again resumed.</p>
                        <p>The United States proposal was, that if the forty-ninth parallel should
                            be found to intersect the Oregon or McGillivray’s River at a navigable
                            point, the whole course of that river thence to the ocean should be made
                            perpetually free to British vessels and subjects.</p>
                        <p>The British Plenipotentiaries were authorized to offer that if the United
                            States would consent to the Columbia being the southern British
                            frontier, the United States should have the harbor in De Fuca Strait,
                            called by Vancouver Port Discovery, with land five miles in breadth
                            encircling it.</p>
                        <p>Should this offer not fully satisfy the United States, the British
                            Plenipotentiaries were then authorized to extend the proposition, so as
                            to include the cession by Great Britain to the United States of the
                            whole peninsula comprised within lines described by the Pacific to the
                            west, De Fuca’s Inlet to the north, Hood’s Canal (so called in
                            Vancouver’s charts) to the east, and a line drawn from the southern
                            point of Hood’s Canal to a point ten miles south of Gray’s Harbor to the
                            south, by which arrangement the United States would possess that
                            peninsula in exclusive sovereignty, and would divide the possession of
                            Admiralty Inlet with Great Britain, the entrance being free to both
                            parties.</p>
                        <p>The negotiations ended in a Convention dated 6th August, 1827. This
                            Convention continued Article III of the Treaty of 1818 indefinitely, but
                            with power to either party to put an end to it on twelve months’ notice,
                            (after 20th October, 1828.)</p>
                        <p>The Convention also contained a saving for the claims of either party to
                            any part of the country west of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

                        <p>Negotiations on the Oregon question remained in abeyance until the
                            special mission of Lord Ashburton to the United States in 1842, when he
                            received the following instructions on this subject:</p>
                        <p>Your lordship may, therefore, propose to the Government of the United
                            States, as a fair and equitable adjustment of their [the two
                            Governments] respective claims, a line <pb n="219" xml:id="pg_219"
                                facs="0249"/>of boundary commencing at the mouth of the Columbia
                            River; thence by a line drawn along the middle of that river to its
                            point of confluence with the Great Snake River; thence by a line carried
                            due east of the Rocky or Stony Mountains; and thence by a line drawn in
                            a northerly direction along the said mountains until it strikes the
                            forty-ninth parallel of north latitude. The southern bank of the
                            Columbia River would thus be *left to the Americans and the northern
                            bank to the English, the navigation of the river being free to both, it
                            being understood that neither party should form any new settlement
                            within the limits assigned to each on the north or south side of the
                            river respectively.<seg type="margin">[iii]</seg></p>
                        <p>Should your lordship find it impracticable to obtain the line of boundary
                            above described, Her Majesty’s Government would not refuse their assent
                            to a line of boundary commencing at the Rocky or Stony Mountains at the
                            point where the forty-ninth parallel of north latitude strikes those
                            mountains; thence along that parallel to the point where it strikes the
                            great northeasternmost branch of the Columbia River, marked in the map
                            as McGillivray’s River; thence down the middle of that river and down
                            the middle of the Columbia River to its junction with the ocean. But
                            your lordship will reject the proposal formerly made by the American
                            Government, in case it should be repeated, of following the forty-ninth
                            parallel of latitude from the Rocky Mountains to the Ocean, as the
                            boundary of the territory of the two States.</p>
                        <p>If the Government of the United States should refuse the proposed
                            compromise, and should nevertheless determine to annul the Convention of
                            1827, the rights of the British Government to the whole of the territory
                            in dispute must be considered as unimpaired.</p>
                        <p>This mission resulted in the Treaty of Washington of 9th August, 1842,
                            which contained no arrangement respecting Oregon. The main reason that
                            induced Lord Ashburton to abstain from proposing to carry on the
                            discussion on this subject was the apprehension that thereby the
                            settlement of the far more important matter of the Northeastern boundary
                            might be impeded or exposed to the hazard of failure.</p>
                        <p rend="center">1843.</p>
                        <p>In August, 1843, Mr. Fox, Her Majesty’s Minister at Washington, was asked
                            whether the United States Government were taking any steps in
                            furtherance of the Oregon Boundary negotiation, and to state that Her
                            Majesty’s Government were willing to transfer the negotiation to
                            Washington should the United States Government object to London.</p>
                        <p>In October instructions were sent to Mr. Everett, the United States
                            Minister in London, to treat with Her Majesty’s Government for the
                            adjustment of the Boundary. In the mean time Mr. Pakenham had been
                            appointed Her Majesty’s Minister to the United States in succession to
                            Mr. Fox. Before his appointment had been gazetted, Mr. Everett informed
                            Lord Aberdeen orally that he had received powers to negotiate the Oregon
                            question in London. Lord Aberdeen, however, stated to him that a new
                            Minister had already been appointed by Her Majesty to negotiate at
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>In consequence of this arrangement the negotiations were removed to
                            Washington, and Mr. Everett stated in a dispatch to his Government <hi

                            an impression on Lord Aberdeen’s mind as to the prominent points of the
                            question as might have a favorable influence in the preparation of the
                            instructions to be given to Mr. Pakenham.</p>
                        <p>In an interview with Lord Aberdeen, Mr. Everett urged that the boundary
                            should be carried along the forty-ninth parallel to the sea. Lord
                            Aberdeen said that this proposal had been made in 1824 and 1826, and
                            rejected, and that there was no reason for believing that this country,
                            more than the United States, would then agree to terms which had been
                            previously declined, and that consequently there must be concession <pb
                                n="220" xml:id="pg_220" facs="0250"/>on both sides, on which
                            principle Lord Aberdeen expressed himself willing to act.</p>
                        <p>In December Mr. Pakenham was authorized to re-open negotiations at
                            Washington on the Oregon question. He was directed to make substantially
                            the same proposals for the settlement of the boundary as had been made
                            by Great Britain in 1826.</p>
                        <p>He was authorized to add, should that proposition be found to be
                            unacceptable, that *Her Majesty’s Government would be willing to convert
                            into a free port any harbor, either on the main-land or on Vancouver’s
                            Island, south of the forty-ninth parallel, which the United States
                            Government might desire.<seg type="margin">[iv]</seg></p>
                        <p>Further, if he should think that the extension of the privilege would
                            lead to the final adjustment of the question, he was authorized to
                            declare that Her Majesty’s Government would be willing to make all the
                            ports within De Fuca’s Inlet, and south of the forty-ninth parallel,
                            free ports.</p>
                        <p>Should these proposals be rejected, he was then to propose that the whole
                            question should be referred to the arbitration of a friendly Sovereign
                            State.</p>
                        <p>In the event of the United States Government refusing to agree to
                            arbitration, he was then to propose that the Treaty of 1818–27 should be
                            renewed for a further period of ten years.</p>
                        <p>In the event of negotiations being broken off, he was then to declare to
                            the United States Government that Her Majesty’s Government still
                            asserted and would maintain an equal right with the United States to the
                            occupation of the whole of the territory in dispute, and that as Her
                            Majesty’s Government would carefully and scrupulously abstain and cause
                            Her Majesty’s subjects to abstain from any act which might be justly
                            considered as an encroachment on the rights of the United States, so
                            they expected that the Government of the United States would exhibit and
                            enforce on their part an equal forbearance with respect to the rights of
                            Great Britain, which rights, believing them to be just, Great Britain
                            would be prepared to defend.</p>
                        <p rend="center">1844.</p>
                        <p>In February, 1844, Mr. Pakenham addressed a note to the United States
                            Secretary of State proposing a renewal of the negotiations, which
                            proposal was favorably received by him.</p>
                        <p>On 22nd August, Mr. Pakenham received a notification from Mr. Calhoun,
                            then the Secretary of State, that he was prepared to proceed with the
                            negotiation.</p>
                        <p>At a conference on the 26th, Mr. Pakenham laid before Mr. Calhoun the
                            proposal authorized by his instructions relative to a free port either
                            on the main-land or on Vancouver’s Island south of the forty-ninth
                            parallel.</p>
                        <p>This proposal was declined by Mr. Calhoun. He afterwards presented a
                            paper (dated September 3) stating his reasons. The paper began thus:
                                <quote rend="blockquote"><p>The Undersigned American Plenipotentiary
                                    declines the proposal of the British Plenipotentiary, on the
                                    ground that it would have the effect of restricting the
                                    possessions of the United States to limits far more
                                    circumscribed than their claims clearly entitle them to. It
                                    proposes to limit their northern boundary by a line drawn from
                                    the Rocky Mountains along the forty-ninth parallel of latitude
                                    to the northeasternmost branch of the Columbia River, and thence
                                    down the middle of that river to the sea, giving to Great
                                    Britain all the country north, and to the United States all
                                    south of that line, except a detached territory extending on the

                                    States any port which the United States Government might desire,
                                    either on the main-land or on Vancouver’s Island south of

                                <p>By turning to the map hereto annexed, and on which the proposed
                                    boundary is marked in pencil, it will be seen that it assigns to
                                    Great Britain almost the entire region on its north side drained
                                    by the Columbia River, and lying on its northern bank. It is not

                                    States to this territory, and the grounds on which they rest, in
                                    order to make good the assertion that it restricts the
                                    possessions of the United States within narrower bounds than
                                    they are clearly entitled to. It will be sufficient for this
                                    purpose to show that they are fairly entitled to the entire
                                    region drained by the river; and to the establishment of this
                                    point, the Undersigned proposes accordingly to limit his remarks

                        <p>In answer to this statement, Mr. Pakenham delivered a paper (marked D,
                            and dated September 12) of which it is sufficient for the present
                            purpose to state the concluding passages: <quote rend="blockquote"><p>In
                                    fine, the present state of the question between the two
                                    Governments appears to be this: Great Britain possesses and
                                    exercises, in common with the United States, a right of joint
                                    occupancy in the Oregon Territory, of which right she can be
                                    divested, with respect to any part of that territory, only by an
                                    equitable partition of the whole between the two Powers.</p>
                                <p>It is, for obvious reasons, desirable that such a partition
                                    should take place as soon as possible, and the difficulty
                                    appears to be in devising a line of demarkation which shall
                                    leave to each party that precise portion of the territory best
                                    suited to its interest and convenience.</p>
                                <p>The British Government entertained the hope that by the proposal
                                    lately submitted for the consideration of the American
                                    Government, that object would have been accomplished. According
                                    to the arrangements therein contemplated, the Northern Boundary
                                    of the United States west of the Rocky Mountains would, for a
                                    considerable distance, be carried along the same parallel of
                                    latitude which forms their Northern boundary on the eastern side
                                    of those mountains, thus uniting the present Eastern Boundary of
                                    the Oregon Territory with the Western Boundary of the United
                                    States, from the forty-ninth parallel downwards. From the point
                                    where the 49° of latitude intersects the northeastern branch of
                                    the Columbia River, called in that part of its course
                                    McGillivray’s River, the proposed line of boundary would be
                                    along the middle of that river till it joins the Columbia, then
                                    along the middle of the Columbia to the ocean, the navigation of
                                    the river remaining perpetually free to both parties.</p>
                                <p>In addition Great Britain offers a separate territory on the
                                    Pacific, possessing an excellent harbor, with a further
                                    understanding that any port or ports, whether on Vancouver’s
                                    Island or on the Continent, south of the forty-ninth parallel,
                                    to which the United States might desire to have access, shall be
                                    made free ports.</p>
                                <p>It is believed that by this arrangement, ample justice would be
                                    done to the claims of the United States, on whatever ground
                                    advanced, with relation to the Oregon Territory. As regards
                                    extent of territory, they would obtain, acre for acre, nearly
                                    half of the entire territory to be divided. As relates to the
                                    navigation of the principal river, they would enjoy a perfect
                                    equality of right with Great Britain; and, with respect to
                                    harbors, it will be seen that Great Britain shows every
                                    disposition to consult their convenience in that particular.</p>
                                <p>On the other hand, were Great Britain to abandon the line of the
                                    Columbia as a frontier, and to surrender her right to the
                                    navigation of that river, the prejudice occasioned to her by
                                    such an arrangement would, beyond all proportion, exceed the
                                    advantage accruing to the United States from the possession of a
                                    few more square miles of territory. It must be obvious to every
                                    impartial investigator of the subject that, in adhering to the
                                    line of the Columbia, Great Britain is not influenced by motives
                                    of ambition with reference to extent of territory, but by
                                    considerations of utility, not to say necessity, which cannot be
                                    lost sight of, and for which allowance ought to be made in an
                                    arrangement professing to be based on considerations of mutual
                                    convenience and advantage.</p>
                                <p>The Undersigned believes that he has now noticed all the
                                    arguments advanced by the American Plenipotentiary in order to
                                    show that the United States are fairly entitled <pb n="222"
                                        xml:id="pg_222" facs="0252"/>to the entire region drained by
                                    the Columbia River. He sincerely regrets that their views on
                                    this subject should differ in so many essential respects.</p>
                                <p>It remains for him to request that, as the American
                                    Plenipotentiary declines the proposal offered on the part of
                                    Great Britain, he will have the goodness to state what
                                    arrangement he is on the part of the United States prepared to
                                    propose for an equitable adjustment of the question; and more
                                    especially, that he will have the goodness to define the nature
                                    and extent of the claims which the United States may have to
                                    other portions of the territory, to which allusion is made in
                                    the concluding part of his statement, as it is obvious that no
                                    arrangement can be made with respect to part of the territory in
                                    dispute, while a claim is reserved to any portion of the
                                    remainder.</p>

                        <p>*Mr. Calhoun then presented a paper, (dated September 20,) in which he
                            said he had read with attention the counter-statement of the British
                            Plenipotentiary, but without weakening his confidence in the validity of
                            the title of the United States, and, after arguments, concluded
                                thus:<seg type="margin">[vi]</seg>
                            <quote rend="blockquote"><p>The Undersigned cannot consent to the
                                    conclusion to which, on a review of the whole ground, the
                                    counter-statement arrives, that the present state of the
                                    question is, that Great Britain possesses and exercises, in
                                    common with the United States, a right of joint occupancy in the
                                    Oregon Territory, of which she can be divested only by an
                                    equitable partition of the whole between the two Powers. He
                                    claims, and he thinks he has shown, a clear title on the part of
                                    the United States to the whole region drained by the Columbia,
                                    with the right of being reinstated and considered the party in
                                    possession while treating of the title, in which character he
                                    must insist on their being considered in conformity with
                                    positive Treaty stipulations. He cannot, therefore, consent that
                                    they shall be regarded, during the negotiation, merely as
                                    occupants in common with Great Britain, nor can he, while thus
                                    regarding their rights, present a counter-proposal based on the
                                    supposition of a joint occupancy, merely until the question of
                                    title to the territory is fully discussed. It is, in his
                                    opinion, only after a discussion which shall fully present the
                                    titles of the parties respectively to the territory, that their
                                    claims to it can be fairly and satisfactorily adjusted. The
                                    United States desire only what they may deem themselves justly
                                    entitled to, and are unwilling to take less. With their present
                                    opinion of their title, the British Plenipotentiary must see
                                    that the proposal which he made at the second Conference, and
                                    which he more fully sets forth in his counter-statement, falls
                                    far short of what they believe themselves justly entitled
                                    to.</p>

                                    and which they must regard as giving them a right to the extent
                                    to which they can be established, unless a better can be

                        <p>In various informal conversations between Mr. Pakenham and Mr. Calhoun,
                            when Mr. Calhoun insisted on the parallel of 49° as the very lowest
                            terms which the United States would accept, Mr. Pakenham told him that,
                            if he wished Her Majesty’s Government even to take into consideration a
                            proposal founded on that basis, it must be accompanied by some
                            indications of a desire on the part of the United States Government to
                            make some corresponding sacrifice to accommodate the interest and
                            convenience of Great Britain; that Her Majesty’s Government had already
                            gone very far in the way of concession, while the United States
                            Government had as yet shown no disposition to recede from their original
                            proposal. To which Mr. Calhoun replied, on one occasion, that for his
                            part he should have no objection to give up absolutely the free
                            navigation of the Columbia, which had before been offered only
                            conditionally; on another occasion, he said that if Great Britain would
                            consent to the parallel of 49° on the Continent, perhaps the United
                            States might be willing to leave to Great Britain the entire possession
                            of Vancouver’s Island, Fuca’s Inlet, and the passage northwards from it
                            to the Pacific remaining an open sea to both countries; but he never
                            said that he would be ready to yield both these points. In fact, he said
                            that he <pb n="223" xml:id="pg_223" facs="0253"/>was not authorized to
                            make any proposal of the kind, nor should he until he had ascertained

                            that he continues to entertain the hope that the question may be settled

                            of opinion it would be unadvisable to entertain a proposal to resort to
                            any other mode, so long as there is hope of arriving at a satisfactory
                            settlement by negotiation; and especially to one which might rather
                            retard than expedite its final adjustment.<seg type="margin"

                        <p>On the 3d of April, Lord Aberdeen addressed to Mr. Pakenham the following
                            dispatch, the tone and contents of which show the seriousness of the
                            position in which the controversy then was, and the determination of Her
                            Majesty’s Government to maintain their claims: <quote rend="blockquote"
                                    ><p rend="right"><hi rend="smallcaps">April</hi> 3, 1845.</p>
                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The inaugural speech of President
                                    Polk has impressed a very serious character on our actual
                                    relations with the United States; and the manner in which he has
                                    referred to the Oregon question, so different from the language
                                    of his predecessor, leaves little reason to hope for any
                                    favorable result of the existing negotiation.</p>
                                <p>I presume that you will have acted upon my instruction of the 3d
                                    of March, and have repeated to the new Secretary of State the
                                    proposal of an arbitration, which you were directed to make to
                                    his predecessor. If this should be declined by Mr. Polk’s
                                    Government in the same manner and for the same reason as
                                    assigned by Mr. Tyler, namely, the hope that the matter might
                                    yet be favorably terminated by negotiation, such a mode of
                                    refusal would at least display a friendly spirit, and would not
                                    close the door against all further attempts to arrive at such a
                                    conclusion. On the other hand, if the proposal should be simply
                                    rejected, and the rejection should not be accompanied by any
                                    specific proposition on the part of the Government of the United
                                    States, we must consider the negotiation as entirely at an end.
                                    Indeed, we could scarcely, under such circumstances, take any
                                    further step with a due regard to our honor and consistency.</p>
                                <p>In the event of arbitration being rejected, and the failure of
                                    every endeavor to effect a partition of the territory on a
                                    principle of mutual concession, you were directed, in my
                                    dispatch of the 18th of November, to propose the further
                                    extension for a fixed term of years of the existing Convention.
                                    This, it is true, would have been an imperfect and
                                    unsatisfactory arrangement; but it might have been tolerated in
                                    the hope that the prevalence of friendly feelings, and the
                                    admitted interest of both parties, would in due time have led to
                                    a permanent settlement of an amicable description. The recent
                                    declarations of Mr. Polk forbid any such hope; and there is too
                                    much reason to believe that the extension of the Convention for
                                    a fixed period would be employed in active preparation for
                                    future hostility.</p>
                                <p>You will, therefore, consider this portion of my instructions, to
                                    which I have now referred, as canceled.</p>
                                <p>Judging from the language of Mr. Polk, I presume we must expect
                                    that the American Government will renounce the Treaty without
                                    delay. In this case, unless the question be speedily settled, a
                                    local collision will be liable to take place, which may involve
                                    the countries in serious difficulty, and not improbably lead to
                                    war itself.</p>
                                <p>At all events, whatever may be the course of the United States
                                    Government, the time is come when we must be prepared for every
                                    contingency. Our naval force in the Pacific is amply sufficient
                                    to maintain our supremacy in that sea; and Sir George Seymour
                                    has been instructed to repair without delay to the coasts of the
                                    Oregon Territory.</p>
                                <p>You will hold a temperate, but firm, language to the members of
                                    the Government and to all those with whom you may converse. We
                                    are still ready to adhere to the principle of an equitable
                                    compromise; but we are perfectly determined to concede nothing
                                    to force or menace, and are fully prepared to maintain our
                                    rights. This is the spirit in which Her Majesty’s Government
                                    have declared themselves in Parliament, and to this they will
                                    adhere.</p>
                                <pb n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0254"/>
                                <p>I thought it so important that our intentions should be clearly
                                    known and understood in the United States without delay, that I
                                    detained the last American mail, in order that a correct report
                                    of the proceedings in Parliament on the Oregon question might
                                    reach Washington as early as possible.</p>
                                <p>Nothing can be more encouraging and satisfactory than the spirit
                                    which has been exhibited on this occasion, both in Parliament
                                    and in the country generally; and it is evident that Her
                                    Majesty’s Government will be warmly supported in whatever
                                    measures may be considered really just and necessary.</p>
                                <p>I am, &amp;c.,</p>

                        <p>* Before this dispatch reached Mr. Pakenham, Mr. Buchanan had been
                            appointed Mr. Calhoun’s successor in the office of Secretary of State.
                            Mr. Pakenham informed Mr. Buchanan of the instructions which he had
                            received, again to press on the Government of the United States the
                            expediency of arbitration. But Mr. Buchanan said on one occasion that he
                            did not despair of effecting a settlement by negotiation, by adopting
                            (to use his own words) the principle of giving and taking; and on
                            another occasion that settlement by arbitration did not meet with the
                            concurrence of the President and his Cabinet, that they all entertained
                            objections to that course of proceeding, and that they preferred
                            negotiation, hoping, as they did hope, that by negotiation a
                            satisfactory result would at last be attained.<seg type="margin"

                        <p>On the 16th July, Mr. Buchanan delivered to Mr. Pakenham a paper (marked
                            J. B.) containing his proposal for settlement. It began thus: <quote
                                rend="blockquote"><p>The Undersigned, &amp;c., now proceeds to
                                    resume the negotiation on the Oregon question at the point where
                                    it was left by his predecessor.</p>
                                <p>The British Plenipotentiary, in his note to Mr. Calhoun of the
                                    12th September last, requests “that as the American
                                    Plenipotentiary declines the proposal offered on the part of
                                    Great Britain, he will have the goodness to state what
                                    arrangement he is, on the part of the United States, prepared to
                                    propose for an equitable adjustment of the question, and more
                                    especially that he will have the goodness to define the nature
                                    and extent of the claims which the United States may have to
                                    other portions of the territory to which allusion is made in the
                                    concluding part of his statement, as it is obvious that no
                                    arrangement can be made with respect to a part of the territory
                                    in dispute, while a claim is reserved to any portion of the
                                    remainder.”</p>
                                <p>The Secretary of State will now proceed (reversing the order in
                                    which these requests have been made,) in the first place, to
                                    present the title of the United States to the territory north of
                                    the valley of the Columbia; and will then propose on the part of
                                    the President the terms upon which, in his opinion, this
                                    long-pending controversy may be justly and equitably terminated
                                    between the parties.</p>

                        <p>The paper (after a lengthened argument) ended thus: <quote
                                rend="blockquote"><p>Such being the opinion of the President in
                                    regard to the title of the United States, he would not have
                                    consented to yield any portion of the Oregon Territory, had he
                                    not found himself embarrassed, if not committed, by the acts of
                                    his predecessors. They had uniformly proceeded upon the
                                    principle of compromise in all their negotiations. Indeed, the
                                    first question presented to him, after entering upon the duties
                                    of his office was, whether he should abruptly terminate the
                                    negotiation which had been commenced and conducted between Mr.
                                    Calhoun and Mr. Pakenham on the principle avowed in the first
                                    Protocol, not of contending for the whole territory in dispute,
                                    but of treating of the respective claims of the Parties, “with
                                    the view to establish a permanent boundary between the two
                                    countries, westward of the Rocky Mountains.”</p>
                                <p>In view of these facts, the President has determined to pursue
                                    the present negotiation to its conclusion, upon the principle of
                                    compromise in which it commenced, and to make one more effort to
                                    adjust this long-pending controversy. In this determination he
                                    trusts that the British Government will recognize his sincere
                                    and anxious desire to cultivate the most friendly relations
                                    between the two countries, and to manifest to the world that he
                                    is actuated by a spirit of moderation. He has, therefore,
                                    instructed the Undersigned again to propose to the Government of
                                    Great Britain that the Oregon Territory shall be divided between
                                    the two countries by the forty-ninth parallel of north latitude
                                    from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean; offering, at the
                                    same time, to make free to Great Britain any port or ports on
                                    Vancouver’s Island, south of this parallel, which the British
                                    Government may desire. He trusts that Great Britain may receive
                                    this proposition in the friendly spirit in which it was
                                    dictated, and that it may prove the stable foundation of lasting
                                    peace and harmony between the two <pb n="225" xml:id="pg_225"

                                    principle of continuity equally for both parties, by extending
                                    the limits both of ancient Louisiana and Canada to the Pacific,
                                    along the same parallel of latitude which divides them east of
                                    the Rock Mountains, and it will secure to each a sufficient
                                    number of commodious harbors on the northwest coast of

                                    British Government, respecting the relative value and importance
                                    of the British and American claims, the American Plenipotentiary
                                    will not be surprised to hear that the Undersigned does not feel
                                    at liberty to accept the proposal offered by the American
                                    Plenipotentiary for the settlement of the question.</p>
                                <p>This proposal, in fact, offers less than that tendered by the
                                    American Plenipotentiaries in the Negotiation of 1826, and
                                    declined by the British Government.</p>
                                <p>On that occasion it was proposed that the navigation of the
                                    Columbia should be made free to both parties. On this point
                                    nothing is said in the proposal to which the Undersigned has now
                                    the honor to reply; while with respect to the proposed freedom
                                    of the ports on Vancouver’s Island, south of latitude 49°, the
                                    facts which have been appealed to in this paper, as giving to
                                    Great Britain the strongest claim to the possession of the whole
                                    island, whole island, would seem to deprive such proposal of any
                                    value.</p>
                                <p>The Undersigned therefore trusts that the American
                                    Plenipotentiary will be prepared to offer some further proposal
                                    for the settlement of the Oregon question more consistent with
                                    fairness and equity, and with the reasonable expectations of the
                                    British Government, as defined in the statement marked D, which
                                    the Undersigned had the honor to present to the American
                                    Plenipotentiary at the early part of the present
                                    negotiation.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Pakenham had thus declined to accept the proposal of the United
                            States Government. Mr. Buchanan thereupon delivered another paper dated
                            30th August, in which, after further arguments, he withdrew that
                            proposal. The concluding passages of this paper were as follows: <quote
                                rend="blockquote"><p>Upon the whole, from the most careful and ample
                                    examination which the Undersigned has been able to bestow upon
                                    the subject, he is satisfied that the Spanish-American title now
                                    held by the United States, embracing the whole territory between
                                    the parallelof 42° and 54° 40′, is the best in existence to this
                                    entire region, and that the claim of Great Britain to any
                                    portion of it has no sufficient foundation.</p>
                                <p>Notwithstanding that such was, and still is, the opinion of the
                                    President, yet, in the spirit of compromise and concession, and
                                    in deference to the action of his predecessors the Undersigned,
                                    in obedience to his instructions, proposed to the British
                                    Plenipotentiary to settle the controversy by dividing the
                                    territory in dispute by the forty-ninth parallel of latitude,
                                    offering, at the same time, to make free to Great Britain any
                                    port or ports on Vancouver s Island, south of this latitude,
                                    which the British Government might desire. The British
                                    Plenipotentiary has correctly suggested that the free navigation
                                    of the Columbia River was not embraced in this proposal to Great
                                    Britain, but, on the other hand, the use of free ports on the
                                    southern extremity of this island had not been included in
                                    former offers.</p>
                                <p>Such a proposition as that which has been made, never would have
                                    been authorized by the President, had this been a new
                                    question.</p>
                                <p>Upon his accession to office he found the present negotiation
                                    pending. It had been instituted in the spirit and upon the
                                    principle of compromise. Its object was as avowed by the
                                    negotiators, not to demand the whole territory in dispute for
                                    either country; but, in the language of the first Protocol, “to
                                    treat of the respective claims of the two countries to the
                                    Oregon Territory, with a view to establish a permanent boundary
                                    between them, westward of the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific
                                    Ocean.”</p>
                                <p>Placed in this position, and considering that Presidents Monroe
                                    and Adams had, on former occasions, offered to divide the
                                    territory in dispute by extending the forty-ninth <pb n="226"

                                    Pacific Ocean, he felt it to be his duty not abruptly to arrest
                                    the negotiation, but so far to yield his own opinion as once
                                    more to make a similar offer.</p>
                                <p>Not only respect for the conduct of his predecessors, but a
                                    sincere and anxious desire to promote peace and harmony between
                                    the two countries influenced him to pursue this course. The
                                    Oregon question presents the only cloud which intercepts the
                                    prospect of a long career of mutual friendship and beneficial
                                    commerce between the two nations, and this cloud he desired to
                                    remove.</p>
                                <p>*These are the reasons which actuated the President to offer a
                                    proposition so liberal to Great Britain.<seg type="margin"
                                        >[x]</seg></p>
                                <p>And how has the proposition been received by the British
                                    Plenipotentiary? It has been rejected without even a reference
                                    to his own Government. Nay, more, the British Plenipotentiary,
                                    to use his own language, “trusts that the American
                                    Plenipotentiary will be prepared to offer some further proposal
                                    for the settlement of the Oregon question more consistent with
                                    fairness and equity, and with the reasonable expectations of the
                                    British Government.”</p>
                                <p>Under such circumstances the Undersigned is instructed by the
                                    President to say that he owes it to his own country, and a just
                                    appreciation of her title to the Oregon Territory, to withdraw
                                    this proposition to the British Government which had been made
                                    under his direction, and it is hereby accordingly withdrawn.</p>
                                <p>In taking this necessary step, the President still cherishes the
                                    hope that this longpending controversy may yet be finally
                                    adjusted in such a manner as not to disturb the peace or
                                    interrupt the harmony now so happily subsisting between the two
                                    countries.</p>

                        <p>On 9th February, 1846, the House of Representatives, and on 17th April
                            the Senate, of the United States passed a joint resolution authorizing
                            the President to give the requisite year’s notice to put an end to the
                            Convention of 1827. The notice was dated the 28th of April; it reached
                            the United States Minister at London on the 15th of May, and was by him

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In the critical state of the
                                negotiation for the settlement of the Oregon Boundary, it has become
                                my duty carefully to review the whole course of our proceedings, and
                                to consider what further steps in the present juncture it may be
                                proper to take with the view of removing existing difficulties, and
                                of promoting, if possible, an amicable termination of the
                                question.</p>
                            <p>I willingly abstain from renewing a discussion, the matter for which
                                is already exhausted, and from repeating arguments with which you
                                have long been familiar; but I think it is not too much to assert
                                that, to any observer looking impartially at the different stages of
                                this negotiation, it will appear that the conduct of Great Britain
                                has throughout been moderate, conciliatory, and just. Can it truly
                                be said that the Government of the United States have advanced to
                                meet us in the path of mutual concession?</p>
                            <p>The terms of the settlement proposed by the British Plenipotentiaries
                                to Mr. Gallatin in the year 1826, were much more advantageous to the
                                United States than those which had been offered to Mr. Rush in the
                                previous negotiation of 1824; and on your own departure from this
                                country you were authorized still further to augment these
                                advantageous conditions. The United States, on the other hand, have
                                not only recently made, through Mr. Buchanan, a proposal less
                                favorable to Great Britain than that formerly offered by Mr.
                                Gallatin, but, when this was rejected by you, they withdrew it
                                altogether.</p>
                            <p>In truth, the pretensions of the United States have gradually
                                increased during the progress of these negotiations. Acting in
                                manifest violation of the spirit of the Conventions of 1818 and
                                1827, it is now formally and officially asserted that the right of
                                the United States to the whole territory in dispute is “clear and
                                unquestionable.” The principle, however, of these Conventions
                                plainly recognized the claims of both parties, as indeed was fully
                                admitted by the American Plenipotentiary himself; and it was only on
                                failure of the attempt to effect an equitable partition of the
                                territory that the joint occupancy was established.</p>
                            <p>Such pretensions, whatever may have been their effect in the United
                                States, cannot in any manner invalidate or diminish our own just
                                claims. With respect to these we have never varied. We have always
                                maintained that we possess the right to establish <pb n="227"
                                    xml:id="pg_227" facs="0257"/>ourselves in any part of the
                                country not previously occupied; but we have fully acknowledged in
                                the United States the existence of the same right; and we have also
                                at all times been ready, by au equitable compromise and partition,
                                to put an end to a species of occupation which is but too likely to
                                lead to disputes and collision.</p>
                            <p>Despairing of arriving at any agreement by means of direct
                                negotiation, we have been urgent in *pressing the reference of the
                                whole matter to an arbitration. We have been willing to submit,
                                either the abstract title of the two parties, or the equitable
                                division of the territory, to the judgment of any Tribunal which
                                could justly inspire confidence, and which might prove agreeable to
                                the United States. All this, however, has been peremptorily refused;
                                the progress of the negotiation has been entirely arrested, and, in
                                fact, it now remains without aay admitted or intelligible basis
                                    whatever.<seg type="margin">[xi]</seg></p>
                            <p>The United States have recently expressed their determination to put
                                an end to the Convention which, for the last thirty years, has
                                regulated the mode of occupation of Oregon by the subjects of both
                                countries; but as this power was reserved to each party by the terms
                                of the Convention, the decision cannot reasonably be questioned.
                                Neither is there anything necessarily unfriendly in the act itself;
                                but, as both parties would thus be replaced in their former
                                position, each retaining all its claims and asserting all its
                                rights, which each would freely exercise, it is obvious that, in
                                proportion as the country became settled, local differences would
                                arise which must speedily lead to the most serious consequences.</p>
                            <p>In this state of affairs it is matter of some anxiety and doubt what
                                step, with a view to an amicable settlement of the question, may be
                                most consistent with the dignity and the interests of Great Britain.
                                After all the efforts we have made, and the course we have pursued,
                                we might perhaps most naturally pause, and leave to the United
                                States the office of renewing a negotiation which had been
                                interrupted under such circumstances. But Her Majesty’s Government
                                would feel themselves to be criminal if they permitted
                                considerations of diplomatic punctilio or etiquette to prevent them
                                from making every proper exertion to avert the danger of calamities
                                which they are unwilling to contemplate, but the magnitude of which
                                scarcely admits of exaggeration.</p>
                            <p>I think that an opportunity has now arisen when we may reasonably lay
                                aside those formal considerations by which, under ordinary
                                circumstances, we might have been precluded from making any fresh
                                overture or demonstration on this subject.</p>
                            <p>In complying with the recommendation of the President to terminate
                                the Convention under which the Oregon Territory is at present
                                occupied, the Legislature of the United States have accompanied
                                their decision by resolutions of a pacific and conciliatory
                                character; and have clearly signified to the Executive Government
                                their desire that this step should not lead to the rupture of
                                amicable negotiations for the settlement of the question. I can
                                scarcely doubt that the Government of the United States will be duly
                                influenced by the desire thus unequivocally expressed by Congress;
                                and it is in this hope and belief that I now proceed to instruct you
                                to make another, and, I trust, final proposition to the American
                                Secretary of State for the solution of these long-existing
                                difficulties.</p>
                            <p>I avail myself of this opportunity the more readily, because,
                                although Her Majesty’s Government have strongly pressed a reference
                                of the whole subject to arbitration, they are by no means insensible
                                to the inconvenience attending such a mode of proceeding, and would
                                willingly avoid it if possible. Nothing, indeed, but the
                                apprehension that an amicable settlement by means of direct
                                negotiation was entirely hopeless, would have led them so decidedly
                                to adopt this course; and they are still of opinion that, with such
                                a prospect of failure before them, it would be their duty to adhere
                                as earnestly as ever to this recommendation. Nor can they believe
                                that any Christian Government could ultimately persevere in
                                rejecting a proposal of this nature, whatever might be their
                                objections to its adoption, and in the face of the civilized world
                                deliberately recur to the dreadful alternative of war.</p>
                            <p>The boundary having been fixed by the Convention of 1818, between the
                                possessions of Great Britain and the United States, and the line of
                                demarkation having been carried along the forty-ninth parallel of
                                latitude for a distance of eight hundred or one thousand miles
                                through an unfrequented and unknown country, from the Lake of the
                                Woods to the Rocky Mountains, it appeared to the Government of the
                                United States that it was a natural and reasonable suggestion that
                                this line should be continued along the same parallel, for about
                                half that distance, and through a country as little known or
                                frequented, from the Rocky Mountains to the sea. And, indeed, with
                                reference to such a country, the extension of any line of boundary
                                already fixed might equally have been suggested, whether it had been
                                carried along the forty-ninth or any other parallel of latitude. </p>
                            <p>On the other hand, however, it may justly be observed that any
                                division of territory in which both parties possess equal rights
                                ought to proceed on a principle of mutual convenience, rather than
                                on the adherence to an imaginary geographical line; and in this
                                respect it must be confessed that the boundary thus proposed would
                                be manifestly defective. It would exclude us from every commodious
                                and accessible harbor on the <pb n="228" xml:id="pg_228" facs="0258"
                                />coast; it would deprive us of our long-established means of
                                water-communication with the interior for the prosecution of our
                                trade; and it would interfere with the possessions of British
                                colonists resident in a district in which it is believed that
                                scarcely an American citizen, as a settler, has ever set his
                                    foot.<seg type="margin">[xii]</seg></p>
                            <p>*If, therefore, the forty-ninth parallel of latitude be adopted as
                                the basis of an agreement, it will be incumbent upon us to obviate
                                these objections, which, I trust in great measure, may be
                                successfully accomplished.</p>
                            <p>You will accordingly propose to the American Secretary of State that
                                the line of demarkation should be continued along the forty-ninth
                                parallel from the Rocky Mountains to the sea-coast; and from thence
                                in a southerly direction through the center of King George’s Sound
                                and the Straits of Juan de Fuca, to the Pacific Ocean, leaving the
                                whole of Vancouver’s Island, with its ports and harbors, in the
                                possession of Great Britain.</p>
                            <p>You will also stipulate that from the point at which the forty-ninth
                                parallel of latitude shall intersect the principal northern branch
                                of the Columbia River, called Macgillivray’s River in the maps, the
                                navigation shall be free and open to the Hudson’s Bay Company, and
                                to the subjects of Great Britain trading with the said Company,
                                until its junction with the Columbia, and from thence to the mouth
                                of the river, with free access into and through the same; British
                                subjects, with their goods, merchandise, and produce, to be dealt
                                with as citizens of the United States; it being always understood,
                                however, that nothing shall interfere to prevent the American
                                Government from making any regulations respecting the navigation of
                                the river, not inconsistent with the terms of the proposed
                                Convention.</p>
                            <p>In the future appropriation of land, the possessory rights of all
                                British settlers will of course be respected. The Hudson’s Bay
                                Company should be confirmed in the occupation of Fort Vancouver, and
                                the adjacent lands of which the Company have been in possession for
                                many years. They would also retain such other stations as were
                                necessary for the convenient transit of their commerce along the
                                line of the Columbia; but all other stations, or trading-posts,
                                connected with their present exclusive rights of hunting and of
                                traffic with the natives, within the territory south of the
                                forty-ninth degree of latitude, would in all probability forthwith
                                be abandoned.</p>
                            <p>The Puget Sound Agricultural Company have expended considerable sums
                                of money in the cultivation and improvement of land on the north of
                                the Columbia River. They occupy two extensive farms, on which they
                                possess large stocks of cattle and sheep. These parties would also
                                be entitled to be confirmed in the quiet enjoyment of their land;
                                but if the situation of the farms should be of public and political
                                importance, and it should be desired by the Government of the United
                                States, the whole property might be transferred to them at a fair
                                valuation.</p>
                            <p>I think that these proposals for an adjustment of the whole question
                                at issue would be honorable and advantageous to both parties. It can
                                scarcely be expected that either of them should now acquiesce in
                                conditions less favorable than had been previously offered; and it
                                may reasonably be presumed that each will at the present moment be
                                prepared to make larger concessions than heretofore for the sake of
                                peace. By this settlement, in addition to the terms proposed to us
                                by Mr. Gallatin in 1826, we should obtain the harbors necessary for
                                our commerce, as well as an increased security for our settlers and
                                their possessions; and in lieu of the detached district, with its
                                single harbor, offered by the British Plenipotentiaries on that
                                occasion, the United States would acquire the whole coast, with its
                                various harbors, and all the territory north of the Columbia, as far
                                as the forty-ninth degree of latitude.</p>
                            <p>I am not disposed to weigh very minutely the precise amount of
                                compensation or equivalent which may be received by either party in
                                the course of this negotiation, but am content to leave such
                                estimate to be made by a reference to higher considerations than the
                                mere balance of territorial loss or gain. We have sought peace in
                                the spirit of peace, and we have acted in the persuasion that it
                                would be cheaply purchased by both countries at the expense of any
                                sacrifice which should not tarnish the honor or affect the essential
                                interests of either.</p>
                            <p>I have now, therefore, only to instruct you to inform the American
                                Secretary of State that you have been authorized and are prepared to
                                conclude a Convention, without delay, founded on the conditions set
                                forth in this dispatch.</p>

                                    project which I have sent you, the definition of territory
                                    adopted in the Convention of 1827 has been adhered to. That
                                    definition appears to be the most suitable and open to the least
                                    objection.</p>
                                <p>If the United States Government should agree to our terms, such
                                    or nearly such as they are now proposed, you will do well to
                                    hasten as much as possible the conclusion of the Treaty, since
                                    the present constitution of the Senate appears to offer a
                                    greater chance of acquiescence of that important body in those
                                    conditions than might be presented at any future period.</p>
                                <p>If, on the other hand, the President should decline to accept
                                    those terms, and should make any counter-proposition essentially
                                    at variance with their substance, you will express regret that
                                    you possess no power to admit any such modification, and,
                                    without absolutely rejecting whatever proposal may be submitted
                                    on the part of the United States, you will refer the whole
                                    matter to your Government.</p>
                                <p>I am, &amp;c.,</p>

                                boundary now in question, identical with the Treaty as ultimately

                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I received, late in the day, on
                                    the 15th instant, (Friday,) your dispatch No. 27, dated the 28th
                                    of April, 1846, transmitting a notice for the abrogation of the
                                    Convention of the 6th of August, 1827, between the United States
                                    and Great Britain, in accordance with the terms prescribed in
                                    the IInd Article, instructing me to deliver the notice to Her
                                    Britannic Majesty in person, or to Her Majesty’s Principal
                                    Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, as will be most
                                    agreeable to Her Majesty’s wishes, and at the same time leaving
                                    the mode of the delivery of the notice entirely at my own
                                    discretion.</p>
                                <p>I will of course execute your instructions at the earliest
                                    practicable moment. As, however, I could only ascertain Her
                                    Majesty’s wishes, which I am directed to consult, through the
                                    Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, sufficient
                                    time has not yet been afforded for that purpose; and, in the
                                    midst of the preparation of my dispatches for the steamer of
                                    to-morrow, and of my engagements at the Foreign Office connected
                                    with one of the topics of this letter, it has not been in my
                                    power to give to a subject of so much importance that
                                    deliberation which I am sensible a proper exercise of the
                                    discretion confided to me requires. To-morrow, however, I
                                    propose to seek an interview with Lord Aberdeen for the purpose,
                                    and without loss of time finally to execute your instructions in
                                    the mode that may be deemed most effectual. I may add, that
                                    although it is altogether probable that the presentation of the
                                    notice to Her Majesty in person will not be admissible, and that
                                    where a Treaty may be annulled upon notice by one party, the
                                    mode of delivering the notice need not be dependent upon the
                                    assent of the other; yet, in the present instance, I do not
                                    apprehend there will be any difficulty in giving and receiving
                                    the notice in a mode mutually satisfactory, and in conformity
                                    with usage in such cases.</p>
                                <p>In my last dispatch, (No. 43,) dated on the 3d instant, after an
                                    interview with Lord Aberdeen, I informed you that as soon as he
                                    received official intelligence of the Senate’s vote upon the
                                    resolution of notice he would proceed finally to consider the
                                    subject of Oregon, and direct Mr. Pakenham to submit a further
                                    proposition upon the part of this Government, and also that it
                                    was understood that he would not be prevented from taking this
                                    course by any disagreement between the two Houses as to the form
                                    of the notice.</p>
                                <p>I have now to acquaint you that, after the receipt of your
                                    dispatches on the 15th instant by the Caledonia, I had a
                                    lengthened conference with Lord Aberdeen; on which occasion the
                                    resumption of the negotiation for an amicable settlement of the
                                    Oregon question, and the nature of the proposition he
                                    contemplated submitting for that purpose, formed the subject of
                                    a full and free conversation.</p>
                                <p>I have now to state that instructions will be transmitted to Mr.
                                    Pakenham by the steamer of to-morrow, to submit a new and
                                    further proposition on the part of this Government, for a
                                    partition of the territory in dispute.</p>
                                <p>*The proposition, most probably, will offer substantially:<seg
                                        type="margin">[xiv]</seg></p>
                                <pb n="230" xml:id="pg_230" facs="0260"/>
                                <p>First, to divide the territory by the extension of the line on
                                    the parallel of 49 to the sea; that is to say, to the arm of the
                                    sea called Birch’s Bay, thence by the Canal de Arro and Straits
                                    of Fuca to the Ocean, and confirming to the United States what,
                                    indeed, they would possess without any special confirmation, the
                                    right freely to use and navigate the Strait throughout its
                                    extent.</p>
                                <p>Second, to secure to the British subjects occupying lands, forts,
                                    and stations anywhere in the region north of the Columbia and
                                    south of the forty-ninth parallel, a perpetual title to all
                                    their lands and stations of which they may be in actual
                                    occupation; liable, however, in all respects, as I understand,
                                    to the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United States as
                                    citizens of the United States. Similar privileges will be
                                    offered to be extended to citizens of the United States who may
                                    have settlements north of the forty-ninth parallel; though I
                                    presume it is pretty well understood that there are no
                                    settlements upon which this nominal mutuality could operate, I
                                    have no means of accurately ascertaining the extent of the
                                    present British settlements between the Columbia and the
                                    forty-ninth parallel. They are not believed by Lord Aberdeen to
                                    be numerous, however; consisting, as he supposes, of a few
                                    private farms and two or three forts and stations. I have
                                    already, in a previous dispatch, taken the liberty to remind you
                                    that by their Charter the Hudson’s Bay Company are prohibited
                                    from acquiring title to lands, and that the occupations to be
                                    affected by this reservation have been made either by the
                                    squatters of that Company, or by the Puget’s Sound Land Company,
                                    for the purpose of evading the prohibition of the Hudson’s Bay
                                    Charter.</p>
                                <p>They are, in point of fact also, according to Captain Wilkes’s
                                    account, cultivated and used chiefly by the persons employed in
                                    the service of the former Company, and as auxiliary to their
                                    general business of hunting and trapping, rather than with a
                                    view, as it has been generally supposed, of colonizing or of
                                    permanent settlement.</p>
                                <p>Lastly, the proposition will demand for the Hudson’s Bay Company
                                    the right of freely navigating the Columbia River.</p>
                                <p>It will, however, as I understand, disclaim the idea of
                                    sovereignty or of the right of exercising any jurisdiction or
                                    police whatever on the part of this Government or of the
                                    Company, and will contemplate only the right of navigating the
                                    river upon the same footing and according to the same
                                    regulations as may be applicable to the citizens of the United
                                    States.</p>
                                <p>I have already acquainted you that Lord Aberdeen has very
                                    positively and explicitly declined to treat of the navigation of
                                    the St. Lawrence in connection with that of the Columbia; and
                                    that even if it were desirable to us to propose to offer one for
                                    the other, he would on no account enter into any negotiation in
                                    regard to the St. Lawrence.</p>
                                <p>From the date of a private letter to the President in August, I
                                    have seen no cause to change the opinion that, in any attempt to
                                    divide the Oregon territory, the obligation felt by this
                                    Government to protect the rights of their subjects which may
                                    have been acquired or have grown up during the joint occupation,
                                    would most probably interpose the greatest difficulty in the way
                                    of an amicable adjustment. And it is now obvious that the
                                    proposed reservation of the right to the Hudson’s Bay Company of
                                    freely navigating the Columbia, and that in favor of the British
                                    occupants north of the river, proceed from this source; although
                                    it is probable that more or less pride may be felt at giving up
                                    now, without what they may deem an adequate equivalent, what has
                                    been hitherto tendered by our negotiators.</p>
                                <p>In fact, except in the surrender to the United States of the
                                    title of the lands not occupied by British subjects between the
                                    Columbia and the forty-ninth parallel, and also the surrender of
                                    the jurisdiction over the river and the country within the same
                                    limits, I am afraid it may, with some plausibility, be contended
                                    that there is no very material difference between the present
                                    proposition and that offered to Mr. Gallatin by Messrs.
                                    Addington and Huskisson, the British negotiators in 1827.</p>
                                <p>It is scarcely necessary for me to state that the proposition, as
                                    now submitted, has not received my countenance. Although it has
                                    been no easy task, under all the circumstances, to lead to a
                                    re-opening of the negotiation by any proposition from this
                                    Government, and to induce it to adopt the parallel of forty-nine
                                    as the basis of a boundary, nevertheless I hoped it would have
                                    been in my power to give the present proposition a less
                                    objectionable shape, and I most deeply lament my inability to
                                    accomplish it. I have, therefore, felt it my duty to discourage
                                    any expectation that it would be accepted by the President; or,
                                    if submitted to that body, approved by the Senate.</p>
                                <p>I do not think there can be much doubt, however, that an
                                    impression has been produced here that the Senate would accept
                                    the proposition now offered, at least without any material
                                    modification, and that the President would not take the
                                    responsibility of rejecting it without consulting the Senate. If
                                    *there be any reasonable ground to entertain such an impression,
                                    however erroneous, an offer less ob jectionable, in the first
                                    instance at least, could hardly be expected.<seg type="margin"
                                        >[xv]</seg></p>
                                <p>It may be considered certain, also, in my opinion, that the offer
                                    now to be made is not to be submitted as an ultimatum, and is
                                    not intended as such; though I have reason to know that Mr.
                                    Pakenham will not be authorized to accept or reject any <pb
                                        n="231" xml:id="pg_231" facs="0261"/>modification that may
                                    be proposed on our part; but that he will, in such case, be
                                    instructed to refer the modification to his Government.</p>
                                <p>It is not to be disguised that, since the President’s annual
                                    message, and the public discussion that has subsequently taken
                                    place in the Senate, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to
                                    conduct the negotiation in its future stages without reference
                                    to the opinion of Senators, or free from speculation as to the
                                    degree of control they may exercise over the result. Whatever,
                                    therefore, might be prudent and regular in the ordinary course
                                    of things, I think it of the utmost importance, upon the present
                                    occasion, if the President should think proper to propose any
                                    modification of the offer to be made by Mr. Pakenham, that the
                                    modification should be understood as possessing the concurrence
                                    of the co-ordinate branch of the Treaty Power.</p>
                                <p>It is not easy to conjecture, with any certainty, the extent to
                                    which this Government might be induced to modify the
                                    proposition, even if they should be assured that the Senate, no
                                    less than the President, demanded it. It must not escape
                                    observation that, during the preceding administration of our
                                    Government, the extension of the line on the forty-ninth
                                    parallel to the Strait of Fuca, as now proposed by Lord
                                    Aberdeen, was actually suggested by my immediate predecessor as
                                    one he thought his Government might accept; and that, in regard
                                    to those English subjects who would be left within American
                                    jurisdiction by adopting that boundary, he considered that the
                                    provisions of Article II of Jay’s Treaty as a precedent for a
                                    convenient mode of dealing with them. By Article II of Jay’s
                                    Treaty, however, British subjects would not only be secured in
                                    the absolute title to all their lands and effects as fully as by
                                    Lord Aberdeen’s proposition, but would be allowed the option to
                                    continue as British subjects, and without any allegiance to the
                                    Government of the United States; which, according to Lord
                                    Aberdeen’s offer, as I understand it, they would not possess. In
                                    point of fact, therefore, the substantial points of the present
                                    offer, and those which may be expected to be regarded as most
                                    objectionable, are little more than the embodiment of the
                                    various offers or suggestions which, at different times, have,
                                    in some form or other, proceeded from our own negotiators.</p>
                                <p>I have myself always believed, if the extension of the line of
                                    boundary on the forty-ninth parallel by the Strait of Fuca to
                                    the sea would be acceptable to our Government, that the demand
                                    of a right freely to navigate the Columbia River would be
                                    compromised upon a point of time, by conceding it for such
                                    period as might be necessary for the trade of the Hudson’s Bay
                                    Company north or south of the forty-ninth parallel. Entertaining
                                    great confidence in that opinion, and deeming it only
                                    reasonable, I confess that, from an early period, I have used
                                    every argument and persuasion in my power to reconcile Lord
                                    Aberdeen to such a limitation, and, although I am quite aware
                                    that, with a portion of the British public, an importance which
                                    it by no means deserves is attached to the navigation of the
                                    Columbia River, and in that of others it is undeservedly
                                    regarded as a point of pride, I have been disappointed by the
                                    pertinacity with which it has been, at so much risk, insisted
                                    upon. Feeling very sure, however, that the present offer is not
                                    made or intended as an ultimatum, I think it only reasonable to
                                    infer an expectation on the part of those who are offering it,
                                    not only that modifications may be suggested, but that they may
                                    be reasonably required. And therefore I still entertain the
                                    opinion, that although, from a variety of causes—in part,
                                    perhaps, from an expectation that in the United States this
                                    point may not be absolutely insisted upon, and in part from
                                    deference to interests and impressions at home—they could not be
                                    induced in the first instance to make an offer with such a
                                    qualification; yet, if the adjustment of the question should be
                                    found to depend upon this point only, they would yield the
                                    demand to the permanent navigation of the river, and be content
                                    to accept it for such a number of years as would afford all the
                                    substantial advantages to those interests they have particularly
                                    in view that could be reasonably desired. If the only question
                                    upon which the adjustment of the Oregon question depended should
                                    be whether the navigation of the Columbia River should be
                                    granted for a period sufficient to subserve all the purposes of
                                    British subjects within the disputed territory, or whether the
                                    right should be extended indefinitely to a particular class of
                                    British subjects, I must believe that no English statesman, in
                                    the face of his denial of a similar privilege to American
                                    citizens in regard to the St. Lawrence, would take the hazard
                                    upon this point alone of disturbing the peace of the world.
                                    Indeed, if the same Ministry from whom the present offer
                                    proceeds should continue masters of their own proposition by
                                    remaining in office until the qualification I am adverting to
                                    would have to be dealt with, I should feel entire confidence in
                                    the belief I have now expressed.</p>
                                <p>I regret to say, however, that I have not the least expectation
                                    that a less reservation than is *proposed in favor of the
                                    occupants of land between the Columbia and the forty-ninth
                                    parallel would be assented to. I may repeat my convic tion,
                                    founded upon all the discussions in which I have been engaged
                                    here, that in making partition of the Oregon Territory, the
                                    protection of those interests which have grown up during the
                                    joint occupation is regarded as an indispensable obligation on
                                    the score of honor, and as impossible to be neglected. I am
                                    quite sure that it was at one time in contemplation to insist
                                    upon the free navigation of the Columbia River for <pb n="232"
                                        xml:id="pg_232" facs="0262"/>British subjects and British
                                    commerce generally, and that it has been ultimately confined to
                                    the Hudson s Bay Company, after great resistance, and, in the
                                    end, most reluctantly. Being so confined, however, it would be
                                    only reasonable to limit the enjoyment of the right to a period
                                    beyond which the company might have no great object to use the
                                    river for the purposes of their trade. But the interests of the
                                    British subjects who have settled upon and are occupying lands
                                    north of the forty-ninth, are considered as permanent, and
                                    entitled, when passing under a new jurisdiction, to have their
                                    possession secured. This, at least, is the view taken of the
                                    subject by this Government, and not at all likely, in my
                                    opinion, to be changed.<seg type="margin">[xvi]</seg></p>
                                <p>I may add, too, that I have not the least reason to suppose it
                                    would be possible to obtain the extension of the forty-ninth
                                    parallel to the Sea, so as to give the southern cape of
                                    Vancouver’s Island to the United States.</p>
                                <p>It may not be amiss, before leaving this subject, to call your
                                    attention to the position of the present Ministry. The success
                                    of their measures respecting the proposed commercial relaxations
                                    is quite certain; and the Corn Bill, having now finally passed
                                    the House of Commons, may be expected, at no remote day, to pass
                                    the Lords by a majority no less decisive. From that time,
                                    however, the tie which has hitherto kept the Whig party in
                                    support of Sir Robert Peel will be dissolved; and the
                                    determination of the Protectionist party, who suppose themselves
                                    to have been betrayed, to drive him from office, has lost none
                                    of its vigor or power. Indeed, it is confidently reported, in
                                    quarters entitled to great respect, that they have even offered
                                    to the leader of the Whig party to select his own time, and
                                    that, when he is ready, they will be no less prepared to force
                                    Ministers to resign.</p>
                                <p>I have reason to know that, at present, Ministers themselves
                                    believe a change to be inevitable, and are considering only the
                                    mode and the time in which it will be most likely to happen. It
                                    will not be long, after the success of the measures for the
                                    repeal of the Corn Laws, before opportunities enough for the
                                    accomplishment of the object will occur. The Factory Bill,
                                    regulating the hours of labor, will afford one, and most
                                    probably that on which the change will take place. With a
                                    knowledge that the change, sooner or later, must be unavoidable,
                                    and that the offer has been made to the probable head of a new
                                    Ministry to select his own time, may it not be expected that,
                                    instead of waiting quietly to allow the Whig leader to select
                                    the time of coming in, the present Premier will rather select
                                    his own time and mode of going out, and, with his usual
                                    sagacity, so regulate his retirement as to leave as few
                                    obstacles as possible to his restoration to power? In that case
                                    it is not very unlikely he would prefer going out upon the
                                    Factory Bill, before taking ground upon more important measures;
                                    and, if so, it will not surprise me to witness the coming in of
                                    a new Ministry by the end of June, or earlier. With a knowledge
                                    of the proposition now to be made, I am not prepared to say that
                                    one more objectionable might have been apprehended from a Whig
                                    Ministry; unless, indeed, the present Government may be supposed
                                    to be prepared to accept qualifications, when proposed by the
                                    President, which it was un willing at first to offer. Upon that
                                    supposition, it might be desirable that the modifications should
                                    be offered before the coming in of a new Minister, who, finding
                                    only the acts of his predecessor, without a knowledge of his
                                    intentions, might not be so ready to take the responsibility of
                                    assenting to a change. <hi rend="superscript">1</hi>

                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Lord</hi>: Her Majesty’s Government will
                                    necessarily be anxious to hear as soon as possible the result of
                                    my first communications with the United States Government, in
                                    pursuance with your Lordship’s instructions of the 18th of May,
                                    on the subject of Oregon.</p>
                                <p>*I accordingly take advantage of the departure of the Great
                                    Britain steamship to acquaint your Lordship that I had yesterday
                                    morning a conference, by appointment, with Mr. Buchanan, when
                                    the negotiation for the settlement of the Oregon Question was
                                    formally resumed.<seg type="margin">[xvii]</seg></p>
                                <p>As the best explanation which I could offer of the motives which
                                    had induced Her Majesty’s Government to instruct me to make a
                                    fresh, and, as your Lordship hoped, a final, proposition for the
                                    solution of these long-existing difficulties, I read to Mr.
                                    Buchanan an extract from your Lordship’s dispatch No. 18,
                                    beginning with the words, “In this state of affairs, it is a
                                    matter of some anxiety and doubt what steps,” &amp;c., to the
                                    end of the dispatch. It seemed to me that there was nothing in
                                    the observations <pb n="233" xml:id="pg_233" facs="0263"
                                    />contained in this part of your Lordship’s instructions which
                                    might not be advantageously made known to the American
                                    Government.</p>
                                <p>Your Lordship’s language appeared to make a good deal of
                                    impression upon Mr. Buchanan. After I read to him the extract
                                    which I had prepared from the dispatch, he requested to be
                                    allowed to read it over himself, in my presence, with which
                                    request I of course complied. I thought it best not to leave a
                                    copy of it in his hands, having in view the possible, although
                                    not probable, failure of the negotiation which might render it
                                    desirable to deliver to him a copy at length of the dispatch,
                                    with a view to its ultimate publication.</p>
                                <p>I then laid before him a copy of the draught of a Convention
                                    which accompanied your Lordship’s dispatch No. 19, which Mr.
                                    Buchanan said he would immediately submit to the President for
                                    his consideration. A minute of what passed between us was then
                                    drawn up and signed, with the draught of the proposed Convention
                                    formally annexed to it.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Buchanan frankly told me that, in his opinion, the only part
                                    of the proposed arrangement likely to occasion any serious
                                    difficulty, was that relating to the navigation of the Columbia,
                                    for he said that the strongest objection existed to granting the
                                    perpetual freedom of the navigation of that river. I did not
                                    fail to point out to him the great difference which existed
                                    between a perpetual and general freedom of navigation, and the
                                    qualified right of navigation contemplated in your Lordship’s
                                    proposition. He admitted the force of my observations in this
                                    sense, but I collect, from what fell from him on this point,
                                    that an attempt will be made to limit the proposed concession to
                                    the duration to the existing charter of the Hudson’s Bay
                                    Company.</p>
                                <p>At 4 o’clock yesterday evening I again met Mr. Buchanan, by
                                    appointment, when he told me that the President had come to the
                                    determination to submit our whole proposition to the Senate for
                                    their advice, and that it would accordingly be sent to the
                                    Senate at an early day with a Message, which Message might, and
                                    probably would, suggest some modifications of it. What these
                                    modifications might be, Mr. Buchanan said, had not yet been
                                    determined; but I imagine they will not involve anything
                                    essentially hostile to the adoption of the proposed arrangement,
                                    or which may not be overcome by friendly negotiation and
                                    explanation between the two Governments.</p>
                                <p>As relates to the Senate, my Lord, when we consider the moderate
                                    and conciliatory spirit in which the entire question of Oregon
                                    has been treated by a large majority of that body since the
                                    opening of the present session of Congress, I think it may be
                                    fairly expected that their advice to the President on the
                                    reference which is about to be made to them will rather favor
                                    than impede an early and satisfactory termination of the Oregon
                                    difficulties.</p>
                                <p>I should add that, in addition to what Mr. Buchanan said about
                                    the navigation of the Columbia, he gave it as his opinion that
                                    it would be necessary, and even advisable, with the view to
                                    avoid future misunderstanding, to define, or provide for the
                                    early definition of, the limits of the farms and lands now in
                                    the occupation of the Puget Sound Agricultural Company, and
                                    which it is proposed shall be confirmed to the Association in
                                    perpetuity. To such a proviso, if conceived in a spirit of
                                    liberality and fairness, I imagine that Her Majesty’s Government
                                    will have no objection. But upon this point, as well as what
                                    relates to the navigation of the Columbia, I will act with due
                                    caution, and, to the best of my humble judgment and ability, in
                                    conformity with the spirit and intention of your Lordship’s
                                    instructions, as set forth in your Lordship’s dispatch No.

                            <p>On the 10th of June, the President of the United States sent this
                                Message to the Senate:</p>
                            <frus:attachment>
                                <p>I lay before the Senate a proposal, in the form of a Convention,
                                    presented to the Secretary of State on the 6th instant, by the
                                    Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of Her
                                    Britannic Majesty, for the adjustment of the Oregon question,
                                    together with a protocol of this proceeding. I *submit this
                                    proposal to the consideration of the Senate, and request their
                                    advice as to the action which, in their judgment, it may be
                                    proper to take in reference to it.<seg type="margin"
                                        >[xviii]</seg></p>
                                <p>In the early periods of the Government, the opinion and advice of
                                    the Senate were often taken in advance upon important questions
                                    of our foreign policy. General Washington repeatedly consulted
                                    the Senate, and asked their previous advice upon pending
                                    negotiations with foreign Powers; and the Senate in every
                                    instance responded to this call by giving their advice, to which
                                    he always conformed his action. This practice, though rarely
                                    resorted to in latter times, was, in my judgment, eminently
                                    wise, and may, on occasions of great importance, be properly
                                    revived. The Senate are a branch of the Treaty-making Power; and
                                    by consulting them in advance of his own action upon important
                                    measures of foreign policy which may ultimately come before them
                                    for their consideration, the President secures harmony of action
                                    between that <pb n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0264"/>body and
                                    himself. The Senate are, moreover, a branch of the war-making
                                    Power, and it may be eminently proper for the Executive to take
                                    the opinion and advice of that body in advance upon any great
                                    question which may involve in its decision the issue of peace or
                                    war. On the present occasion, the magnitude of the subject would
                                    induce me under any circumstances to desire the previous advice
                                    of the Senate; and that desire is increased by the recent
                                    debates and proceedings in Congress, which render it, in my
                                    judgment, not only respectful to the Senate, but necessary and
                                    proper, if not indispensable, to insure harmonious action
                                    between that body and the Executive. In conferring on the
                                    Executive the authority to give the notice for the abrogation of
                                    the Convention of 1827, the Senate acted publicly so large a
                                    part, that a decision on the proposal now made by the British
                                    Government, without a definite knowledge of the views of that
                                    body in reference to it, might render the question still more
                                    complicated and difficult of adjustment. For these reasons I
                                    invite the consideration of the Senate to the proposal of the
                                    British Government for the settlement of the Oregon question,
                                    and ask their advice on the subject.</p>
                                <p>My opinions and my action on the Oregon question were fully made
                                    known to Congress in my annual Message of the 2d of December
                                    last; and the opinions therein expressed remain unchanged.</p>
                                <p>Should the Senate, by the constitutional majority required for
                                    the ratification of Treaties, advise the acceptance of this
                                    proposition, or advise it with such modifications as they may,
                                    upon full deliberation, deem proper, I shall conform my action
                                    to their advice. Should the Senate, however, decline by such
                                    constitutional majority to give such advice, or to express an
                                    opinion on the subject, I shall consider it my duty to reject
                                    the offer.</p>
                                <p>I also communicate herewith an extract from a dispatch of the
                                    Secretary of State to the Minister of the United States at

                                    the President sent a Message on Wednesday last to the Senate

                                <p>After a few hours’ deliberation on each of the three days,
                                    Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, the Senate, by a majority of 38
                                    votes to 12, adopted, yesterday evening, a resolution advising
                                    the President to accept the terms proposed by Her Majesty’s
                                    Government. The President did not hesitate to act on this
                                    advice, and Mr. Buchanan accordingly sent for me this morning,
                                    and informed me that the conditions offered by Her Majesty’s
                                    Government were accepted by the Government of the United States,
                                    without the addition or alteration of a single word.</p>
                                <p>At the beginning of our conversation, Mr. Buchanan observed to me
                                    that the privilege of navigating the Columbia River, which, by
                                    the second Article of the Convention, is secured to the Hudson’s
                                    Bay Company, and to British subjects trading with the same, was
                                    understood by the Senate to be limited to the duration of the
                                    license under which the Company now carry on their operations in
                                    the country west of the Rocky Mountains; to which I replied,
                                    that the Article proposed by Her Majesty’s Government spoke for
                                    itself; that any alteration from the precise wording of that
                                    Article which <pb n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0265"/>the
                                    United States Government might wish, to introduce would involve
                                    the necessity of a reference to England, and consequently, to
                                    say the least of it, some delay in the termination of the
                                    business. This, he seemed to think, under all the circumstances
                                    of the case, had better he avoided, and it was finally agreed
                                    that fair copies of the Convention should he prepared, and the
                                    signature take place on Monday next. <hi rend="superscript"

                                <p>On Tuesday, probably, the Convention will he submitted to the
                                    Senate, where its approval may now he considered as a matter of

                                    may be forwarded to England by the Great Western steam-packet,

                                Senate, a Convention was concluded and signed on 15th June, and that
                                Convention he then laid before the Senate for their consideration,

                                    my dispatch No. 19, of the 18th of May, and also the intention
                                    of the President to proceed forthwith to the completion of the
                                    proposed Convention.</p>
                                <p>In your dispatch you state that Mr. Buchanan had observed to you
                                    that the privilege of navigating the Columbia River, which, by
                                    the second Article of the Convention, is secured to the Hudson’s
                                    Bay Company, and to British subjects trading with the same, was
                                    understood by the Senate to be limited to the duration of the
                                    license under which the Company now carry on their operations in
                                    the country west of the Rocky Mountains; to which observation
                                    you very properly replied that the Article proposed by Her
                                    Majesty’s Government spoke for itself.</p>
                                <p>Nothing, in fact, can well be clearer than the language of that
                                    Article. In drawing, it up I had not the smallest intention of
                                    restricting the British right to navigate the Columbia in the
                                    manner supposed, nor can I comprehend how such a supposition
                                    could have been entertained by the Senate, for I have reason to
                                    know that Mr. MacLane fully and faithfully reported to his
                                    Government all that passed between himself and me respecting the
                                    navigation of the Columbia. In every conversation that we held
                                    on the subject of the proposed Treaty, I not only declared to
                                    Mr. MacLane that we must insist on the permanent right being
                                    secured to us to navigate the Columbia, but I even showed him
                                    the project of the Treaty, and, on his expressing an
                                    apprehension that the provision contained in the second Article
                                    would not be accepted unless the right of navigation were
                                    limited to a term of years, I positively declined to accede to
                                    this suggestion.</p>
                                <pb n="236" xml:id="pg_236" facs="0266"/>
                                <p>I think it right to state these facts, in order to obviate any
                                    misapprehension which might possibly hereafter be raised on the
                                    construction of the second Article of the Oregon Treaty.</p>

                                        MacLane to his Government, reporting what had passed between
                                        the Earl of Aberdeen and himself with relation to the
                                        proposition which Lord Aberdeen was about to make to this
                                        Government, for the partition of the Oregon Territory.</p>
                                    <p>It would appear from this dispatch that Mr. MacLane had no
                                        expectation that the terms proposed by Her Majesty’s
                                        Government would be accepted here; that he discouraged any
                                        such expectation on the part of Her Majesty’s Government,
                                        considering as “erroneous” an impression, which he found had
                                        been produced in England, “that the Senate would accept the
                                        proposition now offered, at least without any material
                                        modification, and that the President would not take the
                                        responsibility of rejecting it without consulting the
                                        Senate;” and, finally, that he gave it as his opinion to the
                                        American Government that the offer then made was not
                                        submitted as an “ultimatum,” nor intended as such; in short,
                                        that some modification of its terms would, without much
                                        difficulty, be acceded to by England.</p>
                                    <p>*It is most providential, my Lord, that Mr. MacLane’s
                                        suggestions did not succeed, either in England, in deterring
                                        Lord Aberdeen from making his offer, ac cording to his
                                        original intention, or here, in inducing the American
                                        Government to stand out for some modification of that offer
                                        when it was made; for, in either case, all would have been
                                            spoiled.<seg type="margin">[xxi]</seg></p>

                                        Majesty’s Government for the consideration of the Senate, is
                                        very guarded—upon the whole, rather deprecating than
                                        encouraging the acceptance of the offer; but in this course
                                        the President ran no risk and incurred no responsibility

                                        with the disposition of the Senate, knew that such a

                                    resolution of the Senate of the 17th June last.</p>
                                <p>Among the papers thus made public, the one which I should most
                                    particularly recommend to your Lordship’s attention, is a
                                    dispatch from Mr. Buchanan to Mr. MacLane, dated the 12th of
                                    July, 1845, (Union of 8th August,) setting forth the terms on
                                    which the President was willing, at that time, to settle the
                                    Oregon question, but evidently with little or no expectation
                                    that those terms would be accepted by Great Britain, I might
                                    almost say with an expectation scarcely concealed that they
                                    would be rejected, <pb n="237" xml:id="pg_237" facs="0267"
                                    />when, to use Mr. Buchanan’s own words, the President would “be
                                    relieved from the embarrassment in which he has been involved by
                                    the acts, offers, and declarations of his predecessors,” and be
                                    justified in going to war for the whole territory.</p>
                                <p>The remarkable thing in this dispatch is the confidence which it
                                    betrays that, in the course which the President had made up bis
                                    mind to follow with reference to the Oregon question, he would
                                    receive the countenance and support of the Senate and the
                                    country, even to the extremity of a war with England. The result
                                    has shown that, in this expectation, he did not do justice
                                    either to the wisdom and integrity of the Senate, or to the
                                    intelligence and good sense of the American people.</p>
                                <p>Within a few days after the opening of the late session of
                                    Congress it became evident that Mr. Polk’s policy respecting
                                    Oregon was viewed with no favor by a large majority of the
                                    Senate, nor was the war cry raised by the more ardent partisans
                                    of the Administration responded to in any part of the
                                    country.</p>
                                <p>In process of time this conclusion forced itself on the mind of
                                    the President and his advisers, and hence your Lordship will
                                    find in the ulterior dispatches of Mr. Buchanan to Mr. MacLane a
                                    far more moderate and subdued tone, until at last they exhibit a
                                    positive and conciliatory desire to settle the question by
                                    compromise, the title of the United States to “the whole of
                                    Oregon” having apparently been forgotten.</p>
                                <p>If further proof were wanted of the anxiety of this Government to
                                    be extricated from the mistaken position in which they had
                                    placed themselves, it would be found in the alacrity in which
                                    the terms last proposed by Her Majesty’s Government for the
                                    settlement of the controversy were accepted.</p>
                                <p>Sufficient time has now elapsed since the promulgation of the
                                    Treaty to enable us to judge of the light in which the
                                    transaction has been viewed throughout the country, and it is
                                    gratifying to say that it has been everywhere received with
                                    satisfaction and applause.</p>
                                <p>No evidence whatever of a contrary feeling has come within my
                                    observation, except it be among the disappointed advocates of a
                                    war policy, who had staked their political fortune upon the
                                    adoption of extreme measures, and even in these quarters, I am
                                    bound in truth to say that the irritation is rather against the
                                    President and his ministers for having, as they say, deceived
                                    and betrayed them, than from any express condemnation of the
                                    Treaty itself.</p>

                        <p>In 1669, certain British subjects formed themselves into a Company, for
                            the purpose of undertaking an expedition to Hudson’s Bay.</p>
                        <p>The object of this expedition was twofold:</p>
                        <p>1. To discover a passage through those parts to the Pacific Ocean, or, as
                            it was then oftener called, the South Sea; and,</p>
                        <p>2. To establish a trade in furs, minerals, and other things.</p>
                        <p>For the encouragement of this enterprise a Royal Charter was granted to
                            the Company on the 2d May, 1669. By the terms of this Charter, the
                            Company obtained a Royal Grant of the sole trade and commerce of all the
                            seas, straits, bays, rivers, lakes, creeks, and sounds, in whatsoever
                            latitude they should be, lying within the straits commonly called
                            Hudson’s Straits, together with all the lands and territories upon the
                            countries, coasts, and confines of the seas, bays, lakes, &amp;c.,
                            aforesaid, that were not already actually possessed by the subjects of
                            any other Christian Prince or State. The territory thus acquired was to
                            be thenceforth reckoned and reputed as one of the British Plantations or
                            Colonies in America, to be called Rupert’s Land.</p>
                        <p>For nearly a century after the formation of the Company, they confined
                            their posts to the ample territory which had been granted to them by the
                            Charter of Charles II, and left the task of procuring furs to the
                            enterprise of native hunters, who brought the produce of their hunting
                            to the established marts of the Company.</p>
                        <p>The Company continued to enjoy, until 1784, the monopoly of the trade in
                            these territories, when a rival Company was established, called the
                            North-West Company, which had their head-quarters at Montreal. The
                            North-West Company, instead of following the system of trade adopted by
                            the Hudson’s Bay Company, dispatched their servants into the very
                            recesses of the wilderness to bargain with the native hunters at their
                            homes. As the nearer hunting-grounds became exhausted, the North-West
                            Company advanced their stations westwardly into regions previously
                            unexplored; and, in 1806, they pushed forward a post across the Rocky
                            Mountains, and formed a trading establishment on a lake, now called
                            Fraser’s Lake, situated in 54° north latitude. This would appear to be
                            the first settlement made by civilized men west of the Rocky
                            Mountains.</p>
                        <p>Other posts were soon after formed amongst the Flat-head and Kootanie
                            tribes on the head-waters or main branch of the Columbia; and Mr. David
                            Thomson, the astronomer of the North-West Company, descended with a
                            party to the mouth of the Columbia in 1811. Mr. Thomson and his
                            followers were, according to Mr. Greenhow, the first white persons who
                            navigated the northern branch of the Columbia, or traversed any part of
                            the country drained by it.</p>
                        <p>*In consequence of the rivalry existing between the Hudson’s <pb n="242"
                                xml:id="pg_242" facs="0272"/>Bay and North-West Companies, which led
                            to frequent conflicts between their respective followers, more
                            particularly with reference to certain settlements formed in the Oregon
                            district by Lord Selkirk, the affairs of the Companies were brought to
                            the notice of Parliament in 1819, and their proceedings were minutely
                            investigated. The Government finally interposed its mediation, and a
                            compromise was effected, by which the North-West Company became merged
                            in the Hudson’s Bay Company. Subsequently, and in connection with this
                            arrangement, an “Act for regulating the fur-trade and establishing a
                            criminal and civil jurisdiction in certain parts of North America” was
                            passed in Parliament, <hi rend="superscript">1</hi>
                            <note n="1" xml:id="d125fn1"> Act 1 and 2 Geo. IV, cap. 66; July 2,
                                1821.</note> containing every provision required to give stability
                            to the Hudson’s Bay Company, and efficiency to its operations.<seg
                                type="margin">[xxviii]</seg></p>
                        <p>By this act, which was passed in 1821, the Courts of Judicature of Upper
                            Canada were empowered to take cognizance of all causes, civil or
                            criminal, arising in any of the above-mentioned territories, including
                            those previously granted to the Hudson’s Bay Company, and in “other
                            parts of America not within the limits of either of the provinces of
                            Upper or Lower Canada, or of any civil Government of the United
                            States.”</p>
                        <p>Shortly before the passing of this act, the Hudson’s Bay and North-West
                            Companies were united; and, on the 6th December, 1821, a grant was made
                            by the King to the Company “of the exclusive trade with the Indians of
                            North America.”</p>
                        <p>By this grant the officers in the service of the Company were
                            commissioned as Justices of the Peace for those countries; and the
                            jurisdiction of the Courts of Upper Canada was rendered effective as far
                            as the shores of the Pacific, the only exception made in that respect
                            being with regard to any territory embraced in the grant, situated
                            “within the limits of any civil Government of the United States.” This
                            grant was made for twenty-one years, but before the termination of that
                            period a further grant was received from the Crown by the Company.</p>
                        <p>In the grant of 1821 the following reservations were made in favor of the
                            rights of the Crown, and also of those of subjects of foreign
                            States:</p>
                        <p>But we do hereby declare that nothing in this our grant contained shall
                            he deemed or construed to authorize the said Governor and Company, or
                            their successors, or any persons in their employ, to claim or exercise
                            any trade with the Indians on the northwest coast of America, to the
                            westward of the Stony Mountains, to the prejudice or exclusion of any of
                            the subjects of any foreign States who, under or by the force of any
                            Convention for the time being between us and such foreign States
                            respectively, may he entitled to or shall be engaged in the same trade.
                            Provided, nevertheless, and we do hereby declare our pleasure to he,
                            that nothing herein contained shall extend or he construed to prevent
                            the establishment by us, our heirs or successors, within the territories
                            aforesaid, or any of them, of any colony or colonies, province or
                            provinces, or from annexing any part of the aforesaid territories to any
                            existing colony or colonies to us in right of our Imperial Crown
                            belonging, or for constituting any such form of civil government, as to
                            us may seem meet, within any such colony or colonies or provinces.</p>
                        <p>Such were the provisions made by the British Government for the proper
                            government of the territories situated beyond the Rocky Mountains and on
                            the coasts of the Pacific Ocean. The successful result of these measures
                            for extending the trade of the Hudson’s Bay Company, and for forming
                            settlements in these territories by Great Britain, is given in the
                            following extract from Mr. Greenhow’s History of Oregon and California,
                            in which he says, (page 344:)</p>
                        <p>The relative positions of the two parties (Great Britain and the United
                            States) as to the occupancy and actual possession of the countries in
                            question had been materially <pb n="243" xml:id="pg_243" facs="0273"

                            them. The union of the rival British Companies, *and the extension of
                            the jurisdiction of the Courts of Upper Canada over the territories west
                            of the Rocky Mountains, had already proved most advantageous to the
                            Hudson’s Bay Company, which had at the same time received the privilege
                            of trading in that country, to the exclusion of all other British
                            subjects. Great efforts were made and vast expenses were incurred by
                            this Company in its efforts to found settlements on the Columbia River,
                            and to acquire influence over the natives of the surrounding country;
                            and so successful have been those efforts that the citizens of the
                            United States were obliged not only to renounce all ideas of renewing
                            their establishments in that part of America, but even to withdraw their
                            vessels from its coasts. Indeed, for more than ten years after the
                            capture of Astoria by the British, scarcely a single American citizen
                            was to be seen in those countries. Trading expeditions were subsequently
                            made from Missouri to the head-waters of the Platte and the Colorado,
                            within the limits of California, and one or two hundred hunters and
                            trappers from the United States were generally roving through that
                            region; but the Americans had no Settlement of any kind, and their
                            Government exercised no jurisdiction whatsoever west of the Rocky
                                Mountains.<seg type="margin">[xxix]</seg></p>
                        <p>Under such favorable circumstances, the Hudson’s Bay Company could not
                            fail to prosper. Its resources were no longer wasted in disputes with
                            rivals; its operations were conducted with dispatch and certainty; its
                            posts were extended, and its means of communication were increased,
                            under the assurance that the honor of the British Government and nation
                            were thereby more strongly interested in its behalf. The agents of the
                            Company were seen in every part of the Continent—north and northwest of
                            the United States and Canada, from the Atlantic to the Pacific—hunting,
                            trapping, and trading with the aborigines. Its boats were met on every
                            stream and lake, conveying British goods into the interior, or furs to
                            the great depositories on each ocean, to ship to England in British
                            vessels; and the utmost order and regularity were maintained throughout
                            by the supremacy of British laws. Of the trading-posts many were
                            fortified, and could be defended by their inmates—men inured to
                            hardships and dangers against all attacks which might be apprehended;
                            and the whole vast expanse of territory above described, including the
                            regions drained by the Columbia, was, in fact, occupied by British
                            forces and governed by British laws, though there was not a single
                            British soldier, technically speaking, within its limits.</p>
                        <p>The Hudson’s Bay Company possessed, in 1844, twenty-two forts or
                            establishments west of the Rocky Mountains, of which several were
                            situated on the coasts.</p>
                        <p>On the River Columbia were Fort Vancouver, Fort Walla-walla, Fort
                            Okinagan, Fort Colville; on the River Saptin or Lewis, a branch of the
                            Columbia, were Fort Boisé and Fort Hall.</p>
                        <p>To the south of the Columbia River were Fort George, which occupied the
                            site of the former settlement of Astoria, and Fort Umqua, near the mouth
                            of the Umqua River, which enters the Pacific about one hundred and
                            eighty miles south of the Columbia.</p>
                        <p>At Puget Sound was Fort Nasqually, near which place also the Company had
                            a large agricultural establishment.</p>
                        <p>At the entrance of Fraser’s River was Fort Langley, and further north
                            were Fort Alexandria, and Fort McLaughlin on the coast.</p>
                        <p>In 1849, a grant of Vancouver’s Island was made to the Company by the
                            Crown, but, in 1859, the island was resumed by the Crown and was made a
                            Colony.</p>
                        <p>In 1868, the Company surrendered their remaining territorial rights to
                            the Crown, and the territory over which those rights extended, under the
                            title of Rupert’s Land, was subsequently admitted into and became part
                            of the Dominion of Canada.</p>

                        <p>I have to state to you that the Earl of Aberdeen, to whom I have
                            referred, informs me that he distinctly remembers the general tenor of
                            his conversations with Mr. MacLane on the subject of the Oregon
                            Boundary, and is certain that it was the intention of the Treaty to
                            adopt the mid-channel of the Straits as the line of demarkation, without
                            reference to islands, the position, and, indeed, the very existence of
                            which had hardly at that time been accurately ascertained; and he has no
                            recollection of any mention having been made, during the discussion, of
                            the Canal de Haro, or, indeed, any other channel than those described in
                            the Treaty itself.</p>
                        <p>I also inclose a Memorandum drawn up by Sir Richard Pakenham, the
                            negotiator of the Treaty of 1846.</p>

                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Memorandum by Sir R. Pakenham on the
                                    Water Boundary under the Oregon Treaty of</hi> 1846.</p>
                            <p>I have examined the papers put into my hand by Mr. Hammond, relating
                                to the line of boundary to be established between the British and
                                United States possessions on the northwest coast of America, and I
                                have endeavored to call to mind any circumstance which might have
                                occurred at the time when the Oregon Treaty was concluded, (June 15,
                                1846,) of a nature either to strengthen or to invalidate the
                                pretension now put forward by the United States Commissioner to the
                                effect that the boundary contemplated by the Treaty would be a line
                                passing down the middle of the channel, called Canal de Haro, and
                                not, as suggested on the part of Great Britain, along the middle of
                                the channel called Vancouver’s or Rosario Strait, neither of which
                                two lines would, as I humbly conceive, exactly fulfill the
                                conditions of the Treaty, which, according to their literal tenor,
                                would require the line to be traced along the middle of the channel
                                (meaning, I presume, the whole intervening space) which separates
                                the Continent from Vancouver’s Island. And I think I can safely
                                assert that the Treaty of June 15, 1846, was signed and ratified
                                without any intimation to us whatever on the part of the United
                                States Government as to the particular direction to be given to the
                                line of boundary contemplated by Article I of that Treaty.</p>
                            <p>All that we knew about it was that it was to run “through the middle
                                of the channel which separates the Continent from Vancouver’s
                                Island, and thence southerly through the middle of the said channel
                                and of Fuca’s Straits to the Pacific Ocean.”</p>
                            <p>It is true that, in a dispatch from Mr. MacLane, then United States
                                Minister in London, to the American Secretary of State, Mr.
                                Buchanan, dated 18th May, 1846, which dispatch was not, however,
                                made public until after the ratification of the Treaty by the
                                Senate, Mr. MacLane informs his Government that the line of boundary
                                about to be proposed by Her Majesty’s Government would “probably be
                                substantially to divide <pb n="245" xml:id="pg_245" facs="0275"/>the
                                territory by the extension of the line on the parallel of 49° to the
                                sea; that is to say, to the arm of the sea called Birch’s Bay,
                                thence by the Canal de Haro and Straits of Fuca to the ocean.”</p>
                            <p>It is also true that Mr. Senator Benton, one of the ablest and most
                                zealous advocates for the ratification of the Treaty, (relying, no
                                doubt, on the statement furnished by Mr. MacLane,) did, in a speech
                                on the subject, describe the intended line of boundary to be one
                                passing along the middle of the Haro Channel.</p>
                            <p>But, on the other hand, the Earl of Aberdeen, in his final
                                instructions, dated May 18, 1846, says nothing whatever about the
                                Canal de Haro; but, on the contrary, desires that the line might be
                                drawn “in a southerly direction through the center of King George’s
                                Sound and the Straits of Fuca to the Pacific Ocean.”</p>
                            <p>It is my belief that neither Lord Aberdeen, nor Mr. MacLane, nor Mr.
                                Buchanan, possessed at that time a sufficiently accurate knowledge
                                of the geography or hydrography of the region in question to enable
                                them to define more accurately what was the intended line of
                                boundary than is expressed in *the words of the Treaty, and it is
                                certain that Mr. Buchanan signed the Treaty with Mr. MacLane’s
                                dispatch before him, and yet that he made no mention whatever of the
                                “Canal de Haro as that through which the line of boundary should
                                run, as understood by the United States Government.”<seg
                                    type="margin">[xxxiv]</seg></p>
                            <p>My own dispatches of that period contain no observation whatever of a
                                tendency contrary to what I thus state from memory, and they
                                therefore so far plead in favor of the accuracy of my
                                recollections.</p>

                            the Straits of Haro to be made. If not needed in the Navy Department, I
                            request that the President will direct it to be sent to this Legation.
                            It is intimated to me that questions may arise with regard to the
                            islands east of that Strait. I ask your authority to meet any such claim
                            at the threshold by the assertion of the central channel of the Straits
                            of Haro as the main channel intended by the recent Treaty of Washington.

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have obtained from the Navy Department,
                            and now transmit to you, in accordance with the request contained in
                            your dispatch No. 1, (November 3,) the traced copy of Wilkes’s chart of
                            the Straits of Haro. This will enable you to act understandingly upon
                            any question which may hereafter arise between the two Governments in
                            respect to the sovereignty of the islands situate between the Continent
                            and Vancouver’s Island. It is not probable, however, that any claim of
                            this character <pb n="246" xml:id="pg_246" facs="0276"/>will be
                            seriously preferred on the part of Her Britannic Majesty’s Government to
                            any island lying to the eastward of the Canal of Arro, as marked in
                            Captain Wilkes’s Map of the Oregon Territory. This, I have no doubt, is
                            the channel which Lord Aberdeen had in view when, in a conversation with
                            Mr. MacLane about the middle of May last, on the subject of the
                            resumption of the negotiation for an amicable settlement of the Oregon
                            question, his Lordship explained the character of the proposition he
                            intended to submit through Mr. Pakenham. As understood by Mr. MacLane,
                            and by him communicated to this Department in his dispatch of the 18th
                            of the same month, it was: “First, to divide the territory by the
                            extension of the line on the parallel of 49° to the sea; that is to say,
                            to the arm of the sea called Birch’s Bay, thence by the <hi

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Lord</hi>: On the receipt of your Lordship’s
                            dispatch No. 21, of the 17th ultimo, by which I am instructed to
                            communicate with the United States Government with a view to the
                            adoption of early measures for laying down such parts of the line of
                            boundary between the British and United States territory in North
                            America, described in the Convention of the 15th June, 1846, as the two
                            Governments may, upon mutual consultation, deem it advisable to
                            determine, I waited upon Mr. Buchanan for the purpose of putting him in
                            possession of the views of Her Majesty’s Government upon the
                            subject.</p>
                        <p>After having read to him your Lordship’s dispatch, together with the
                            draught of instructions to the two Commissioners to be appointed in case
                            the views of Her Majesty’s Government were coincided in by the
                            Government of the United States, I proceeded to inquire of Mr. Buchanan
                            whether the manner suggested by your Lordship of bringing the matter
                            under the consideration of the President of the United States, by
                            reading to him your Lordship’s dispatch and presenting to him a copy of
                            the proposed draught of instructions, would be admissible.</p>
                        <p>*To this course Mr. Buchanan objected, as being informal, and contrary to
                            the practice of the United States Government, which coincided, he added,
                            in that respect, with that of the Government of Great Britain, and he
                            requested me, in case your Lordship’s instructions did not preclude me
                            from so doing, to communicate to him in writing the present proposal of
                            Her Majesty’s Government, together with the considerations upon which it
                            is founded, as explained in your Lordship’s dispatch. He might
                            otherwise, he said, find it difficult to convey to the President and to
                            his colleagues in the Cabinet as clear an exposition as he could wish of
                            the views of Her Majesty’s Government upon <pb n="247" xml:id="pg_247"
                                facs="0277"/>the subject, adding that these appeared to him to be so
                            fair and unobjectionable that he could conceive no possible case in
                            which any inconvenience to either Government would result from an
                            unreserved communication of them in writing.<seg type="margin"
                                >[xxxv]</seg></p>
                        <p>I trust that your Lordship will not disapprove of my having, under these
                            circumstances, so far departed from the course pointed out by your
                            Lordship’s instructions as to comply with Mr. Buchanan’s request by
                            addressing to him the note of which I have the honor to inclose a copy,
                            and in which I have embodied the substance of your Lordship’s
                            dispatch.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the expediency of laying down that part of the boundary
                            line suggested by your Lordship’s dispatch, Mr. Buchanan said that he
                            coincided in opinion with Her Majesty’s Government, but he added that it
                            was his own “impression,” although he had not examined the subject with
                            sufficient attention to enable him yet to say that it was his “opinion,”
                            that it would be desirable to go further, and to proceed to mark out on
                            the ground, without unnecessary delay, the boundary line from the point
                            where the forty-ninth parallel of latitude meets the shore of the Gulf
                            of Georgia, eastward to where it strikes the Columbia River, (the
                            portions for which an estimate is made in the third section of Colonel
                            Estcourt’s Memorandum,) and this appeared to him to be advisable from
                            the reports he had lately received of the rapid manner in which
                            colonists from the United States are spreading in that direction.</p>
                        <p>Speaking of the word “channel,” as employed in the Convention of June,
                            1846, Mr. Buchanan said that he himself, and he presumed Mr. Pakenham,
                            in negotiating and signing that Convention, had always conceived
                            “channel” to mean the “main navigable channel,” wherever situated, but
                            he admitted that he had never himself examined, nor did he even
                            recollect ever to have seen, Vancouver’s chart; and although he did not
                            seem prepared to contest the probability of the channel marked with
                            soundings by Vancouver in that chart being, in fact, “the main navigable
                            channel,” he evidently hesitated to adopt that opinion without further
                            geographical evidence, throwing out a suggestion that it would perhaps
                            be better that such instructions should be given to the naval officers
                            to be employed as Joint Commissioners, as would enable them both to
                            determine which of the channels was, in fact, the main navigable
                            channel, and to mark the boundary down the middle of that channel so
                            soon as ascertained.</p>
                        <p>The subject, Mr. Buchanan assured me, should receive the immediate
                            attention of the United States Government, with every disposition to
                            avoid delay or difficulty in the accomplishment of an object which he
                            felt to be extremely desirable for both Governments.</p>

                            Government to call the serious attention of the Government of the United
                            States to the unsatisfactory and hazardous state of things which
                            continues to exist on the boundary which divides the Territory of
                            Washington from the British Possessions occupied by the Hudson’s Bay
                            Company; and Her Majesty’s Government direct me to express their regret
                            that their repeated remonstrances <pb n="248" xml:id="pg_248"
                                facs="0278"/>have not led to any measures which seem to have

                            Territory.</p>
                        <p>I have already had the honor of addressing your Department (in a note to
                            Mr. Hunter on the 27th July last) respecting the depredations upon the
                            property of the Hudson’s Bay Company on the Island of San Juan, by Mr.
                            Ellis Barnes, Sheriff of Watcom County, of the Territory of Washington,
                            in virtue of an alleged claim for taxes due to the authorities of the
                            Territory; and I have now the honor to inclose the copy of a further
                            letter from the Governor of the Hudson’s Bay Company, together with its
                            accompanying documents, in regard to the same matter, from which it
                            appears that no reparation whatever has been made to the Company for the
                            very heavy losses which they incurred on that occasion.</p>
                        <p>You will at once perceive, Sir, that the occurrence in question has
                            arisen out of the conflicting claims of the authorities of Vancouver’s
                            Island and of Washington Territory to the jurisdiction of the Island of
                            San Juan, as appertaining, under the provisions of the Treaty between
                            Great Britain and the United States of 1846, to the dominions of their
                            respective Governments.</p>
                        <p>San Juan is one of the small islands lying in the Gulf of Georgia,
                            between Vancouver’s Island and the main-land; and the question which has
                            arisen between the parties regards the position of the channel through
                            the middle of which, by the provision of the Treaty of 1846, the
                            boundary line is to be run.</p>
                        <p>In the early part of the year 1848; I had the honor, by the instruction
                            of Her Majesty’s Government, to propose to the Government of the United
                            States to name a Joint Commission for the purpose of marking out the
                            northwest boundary; and more particularly that part of it in the
                            neighborhood of Vancouver’s Island, in regard to which, as you will
                            perceive from a reference to my note of the 13th January of that year to
                            the Honorable James Buchanan, the Secretary of State of the United
                            States, Her Majesty’s Government already foresaw the possibility of the
                            occurrence of misunder*standing between the settlers of the respective
                            nations; and Her Majesty’s Government, moreover, then proposed, in order
                            at once to preclude such misunderstandings, that before instructing
                            their respective Commissioners, the two Governments should agree to
                            adopt as the “channel” designated by the Treaty, that marked by
                            Vancouver in his charts as the navigable channel, and laid down with
                            soundings by that navigator.<seg type="margin">[xxxvi]</seg></p>
                        <p>Mr. Buchanan entirely concurring in the expediency of losing no time in
                            determining the position of the boundary line, nevertheless felt some
                            objection to adopting the channel marked by Vancouver as the “channel”
                            designated by the Treaty, in the absence of more accurate geographical
                            information, and he suggested that the Joint Commissioners, when
                            appointed, should be in the first place instructed to survey the region
                            in question, for the purpose of ascertaining whether the channel marked
                            by Vancouver, or some other channel, as yet unexplored, between the
                            numerous islands of the Gulf of Georgia, should be adopted as the
                            channel designated by the Treaty, or, in other words, should be found to
                            be the main channel, through the middle of which, according to the
                            generally admitted principle, the boundary line should be run.</p>
                        <p>To this suggestion Her Majesty’s Government, in the hope that immediate
                            measures would be taken by the Government of the United States to name
                            Commissioners to proceed to the spot with those already designated by
                            the British Government, made no objection.</p>
                        <pb n="249" xml:id="pg_249" facs="0279"/>
                        <p>It has been a subject of regret to Her Majesty’s Government that, from
                            causes upon which it is unnecessary to dwell, no appointment of
                            Commissioners has, up to the present time, been made by the Government
                            of the United States; and I am now instructed again to press this matter
                            on their earnest attention.</p>
                        <p>Should it appear possible, however, that this proposal cannot be met by
                            the Government of the United States without further difficulty or delay,
                            I would again suggest the expediency of the adoption by both Governments
                            of the channel marked as the only known navigable channel by Vancouver,
                            as that designated by the Treaty. It is true that the Island of San
                            Juan, and perhaps some others of the group of small islands by which the
                            Gulf of Georgia is studded, would thus be included within British
                            territory; on the other hand, it is to be considered that the islands in
                            question are of very small value, and that the existence of another
                            navigable channel, broader and deeper than that laid down by Vancouver,
                            by the adoption of which some of those islands might possibly fall
                            within the jurisdiction of the United States, is, according to the
                            reports of the most recent navigators in that region extremely
                            improbable; while, on the other hand, the continued existence of a
                            question of doubtful jurisdiction in a country so situated as Washington
                            Territory and Vancouver’s Island, is likely to give rise to a recurrence
                            of acts of a similar nature to those to which I have had the honor of
                            calling your attention, and which I have no doubt would not be less
                            deplored by the Government of the United States than by that of Great
                            Britain.</p>

                        <p>The Hudson’s Bay Company have been trying to get a grant of Vancouver’s
                            Island. I inquired, from mere curosity, about it. Lord Palmerston
                            replied that it was an affair that belonged exclusively to the Colonial
                            Office, and he did not know the intentions of Lord Grey. He then told
                            me, what I had not known before, that he had made a proposition at
                            Washington for marking the boundaries in the northwest by setting up a
                            landmark on the point of land where the forty-ninth parallel touches the
                            sea, and for ascertaining the division line in the channel by noting the
                            bearings of certain objects. I observed that on the main-land a few
                            simple astronomical observations were all that were requisite; that the
                            water in the Channel of Haro did not require to be divided, since the
                            navigation was free to both parties; though, of course, the islands east
                            of the center of the Channel of Haro were ours. He had no good chart of
                            the Oregon waters, and asked me to let him see the traced copy of
                            Wilkes’s chart. He spoke of the propriety of settling <pb n="250"
                                xml:id="pg_250" facs="0280"/>definitively the ownership of the
                            several islands, in order that settlements might not be begun by one
                            party on what properly belongs to the other. On returning home I sent
                            him my traced copy of Wilkes’s chart, with the note, of which I inclose
                            a copy.</p>

                            Mr. Pakenham on the 6th instant.</p>
                        <p>On yesterday the Senate adopted the following resolution:</p>

                        <p>I have learned from the best sources that the Senate gave this advice
                            under the conviction that, by *the true construction of the second
                            Article of the Projet, the right of the Hudson’s Bay Company to navigate
                            the Columbia would expire with the termination of their present license
                            to trade with the Indians, &amp;c., on the northwest coast of America on
                            the 30th May, 1859. In a conversation with Mr. Pakenham to-day I
                            communicated this fact to him, and requested him to state it in his
                            dispatch to Lord Aberdeen.<seg type="margin">[xxxviii]</seg></p>

                            <p>The undersigned has communicated a copy of this definitive reply to
                                the representative of Her Britannic Majesty at Berlin.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned has received from the British Embassador at Berlin a
                                copy of the second and definitive statement on behalf of the
                                Government of Her Britannic Majesty, together with notice that the
                                same was yesterday submitted through his Serene Highness the Prince
                                of Bismarck to His Majesty the Emperor of Germany.</p>
                            <p>Nothing remains for the undersigned but to express his hope that, now
                                that each party has presented its last word, an early decision may
                                soon remove the cloud of difference that has so long existed on this
                                subject between the Government of the United States and the

                            making the public familiar with this view of the subject. I shall

                            authentic form. * * * *</p>
                        <p>On the 3d day of October, Mr. v. Thile, who has had the charge of the

                            is to be supplied by Mr. de Balan, now German Minister in Brussels. Mr.
                            de Balan will retain for the present his diplomatic rank and
                            appointments, until the German Diet comes together, when it will be
                            proposed to make the place which he is to fill equal to that of a
                            Minister of State.</p>
                        <p>Mr. v. Thile goes out of office with the unanimous and unqualified esteem
                            of all who have transacted business with him. He is a man of honor,

                            for his final action and signature. Just as they arrived, the death of
                            his youngest brother was announced to him by telegraph, and he hastened
                            to Berlin before declaring his opinion.<seg type="margin">Announcement

                            the British Case were referred, have made, each for himself, a very
                            elaborate report on the question, supporting their opinions by reasons
                            stated with technical precision and exactness. The Emperor has also,
                            with the highest sense of official duty, given his personal attention to
                            the subject, and after the most careful study and deliberation, he has
                            arrived at the conclusion satisfactory to his own sense of justice.<seg

                            has the form not so much of a decree in council as of a cabinet order.
                            It does not enter into any elaborate exposition of the decision, but,
                            without diverging in the least from the point presented for arbitration,
                            decrees that the claim of the United States of America is most in

                                our arbitrament the question at issue between them, whether the
                                boundary-line which, according to the Treaty-of Washington of June
                                15, 1846, after being carried westward along the forty-ninth

                                separates the continent from Vancouver’s Island is thence to be
                                drawn southerly through the middle of the said channel and of the
                                Fuca Straits to the Pacific Ocean, should be drawn through the

                                claims; to the end that we may finally and without appeal decide
                                which of these claims is most in accordance with the true
                                interpretation of the treaty of June 15, 1846.</p>

                                of the Government of the United States that the boundary-line
                                between the territories of Her Britannic Majesty and the United

                                the Award of the Imperial Arbitrator, received last evening,
                                relating to the northwestern boundary of the United States of
                                America. In return the President of the United States has charged
                                me, in the name of the people of the United States, to express to
                                His Majesty the German Emperor their thanks for the great pains and
                                attention which His Imperial Majesty has devoted to the question

                            <p>The definitive, friendly settlement of the difference has a peculiar
                                interest and importance. It is now exactly ninety years since the
                                King of Great Britain first formally recognized the existence of the
                                United States of America as an independent State, and <pb n="268"
                                    xml:id="pg_268" facs="0298"/>from that time to the present
                                controversy regarding the boundaries of their respective possessions
                                in America has never ceased even for a single day. During this
                                period the two countries have been repeatedly on the verge of war,
                                growing out of their opposing claims to jurisdiction. After an
                                unrelenting strife of ninety years, the award of His Majesty the
                                Emperor of Germany closes the long and unintermitted, and often very
                                dangerous, series of disputes on the extent of their respective
                                territories, and so for the first time in their history opens to the
                                two countries the unobstructed way to agreement, good understanding,
                                and peace.</p>

                            Emperor is known in England as well as on our own Pacific coast. It
                            establishes us in the equal possession of the Channel of Haro and in the
                            exclusive possession of all the other channels leading north from Fuca
                            Straits and Washington Sound.<seg type="margin">Importance of the
                                award.</seg></p>
                        <p>The award was a grievous disappointment to Admiral Prevost, the very
                            amiable high officer of the British Navy, who had for twenty-one years
                            participated in the management of the case. Up to the last moment he
                            confidently expected a decision in his favor.</p>
                        <p>The conduct of the present British Embassador at this Court, throughout
                            the whole period of the discussions, has been exactly what could have
                            been wished. We have during the whole time preserved intimate friendly
                            relations. This morning he was so good as to call on me, and while it
                            could not be expected of him to be gratified by the award, he did
                            express, and as I believe most sincerely, the greatest satisfaction that
                            all strife between the two Governments, respecting boundaries, had found
                            its end, and that there is no longer an obstacle to the uninterrupted
                            reciprocity of good feeling between the two countries. I met his
                            friendly expressions with perfect cordiality. While a decree could not
                            be on both sides, I pointed out to him that since George III
                            acknowledged our independence in the late summer of 1782 to the present
                            time, the strife about boundaries between the two Governments had known
                            no intermission; now at last there remained no further differences; that
                            therefore the definite friendly settlement effected by the award of the
                            German Emperor opened the way to a new career of reciprocal good feeling
                            between the two countries.<seg type="margin">Conduct of the Critish

                            on the 7th and 8th instant His Lordship caused letters to be addressed
                            to the Colonial Office and to the Admiralty, inclosing copies of the
                            award of the Emperor of Germany on the San Juan WaterBoundary, and
                            requesting that effect may be given to it with as little delay as
                            possible by the withdrawal of the detachment of Royal Marines from the
                            Island of San Juan, and the due notification of the award to the proper

                        <p>In accordance with the tenor of these letters a copy of the award will be
                            forwarded to the Governor-General of the Dominion of Canada and to the
                            Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia, with a request that proper
                            notification of it may be made and effect given to it.<seg type="margin"

                        <p>The Admiralty will also communicate a copy of the award, with as little
                            delay as possible, to the Admiral in command of the Pacific Station or
                            to the Chief Naval Officers at Vancouver’s Island, with the instructions
                            that, in accordance therewith, the detachment of royal marines now
                            stationed at the Island of San Juan should be at once withdrawn. The
                            Admiral or Chief Naval Officer will also be requested to convey to the
                            officer in command of the detachment, and to the men under his orders,
                            the appreciation of Her Majesty’s Government of the harmonious manner in
                            which the joint occupation has been conducted, which reflects the
                            greatest credit on the officers and men of the occupying force of both
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>Earl Granville has further instructed me to propose to the Government of
                            the United States that the work of the Boundary Commission, which was
                            interrupted in 1859, should be resumed and completed by the preparation
                            of a map or chart showing the exact position of the boundary-line from
                            the Gulf of Georgia through the Haro Channel to the ocean, under the
                            Treaty of 1846 and the award of the Emperor of Germany.<seg
                                type="margin">Boundary-line through the Haro Channel.</seg></p>
                        <p>Her Majesty’s Government considers that, in compliance with the
                            Thirty-fifth Article of the Treaty of Washington, this should be done
                            with as little delay as possible in order to give effect to the
                            Emperor’s award. It presumes that the surveys which have already been
                            made will render it unnecessary for another commission to meet on the
                            spot, but it leaves the details of the arrangement to be made for the
                            completion of the work of the commission for further consideration.</p>
