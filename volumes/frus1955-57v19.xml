                <p>The publication <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi>
                    constitutes the official record of the foreign policy of the United States. The
                    volumes in the series include, subject to necessary security considerations, all
                    documents needed to give a comprehensive record of the major foreign policy
                    decisions of the United States together with appropriate materials concerning
                    the facts that contributed to the formulation of policies. Documents in the
                    files of the Department of State are supplemented by papers from other
                    government agencies involved in the formulation of foreign policy.</p>
                <p>The basic documentary diplomatic record printed in the volumes of the series is
                    edited by the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, Department of
                    State. The editing is guided by the principles of historical objectivity and in
                    accordance with the following official guidance first promulgated by Secretary
                    of State Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925:</p>
                <p>There may be no alteration of the text, no deletions without indicating the place
                    in the text where the deletion is made, and no omission of facts which were of
                    major importance in reaching a decision. Nothing may be omitted for the purpose
                    of concealing or glossing over what might be regarded by some as a defect of
                    policy. However, certain omissions of documents are permissible for the
                    following reasons:</p>
                <list>
                    <item>a. To avoid publication of matters that would tend to impede current
                        diplomatic negotiations or other business.</item>
                    <item>b. To condense the record and avoid repetition of needless details.</item>
                    <item>c. To preserve the confidence reposed m the Department by individuals and
                        by foreign governments.</item>
                    <item>d. To avoid giving needless offense to other nationalities or
                        individuals.</item>
                    <item>e. To eliminate personal opinions presented in despatches and not acted
                        upon by the Department. To this consideration there is one qualification: in
                        connection with major decisions it is desirable, where possible, to show the
                        alternative presented to the Department before the decision was made.</item>

                </p>
                <p>The focus of the volume is policy formulation and decisionmaking on national
                    security issues in the foreign affairs community in Washington. The editors
                    selected documents on the basis of their importance in elucidating the review
                    and formulation of U.S. national security policies. These policies included
                    basic national security doctrine, the U.S. missile program, and other scientific
                    and technological developments to deter war and to reduce U.S. vulnerability in
                    the event of surprise attack. The editors also sought to include estimates of
                    probable popular reactions to nuclear war and of destruction and casualties in
                    the event of general war, responses to local aggression, limited war, internal
                    subversion, and civil defense.</p>
                <p>Very few documents concern diplomatic negotiations or reporting from abroad. Arms
                    control and atomic energy are also national security issues, but documentation
                    on these subjects, including disarmament talks in Europe, is contained in Volume
                    XX, Regulation of Armaments; Atomic Energy. The political-military capabilities
                    and intentions of the Soviet Union, which U.S. policymakers perceived as an
                    omnipresent threat to the security interests of the United States and its
                    allies, receive considerable attention in this volume, but national security
                    issues pertaining primarily to other countries or regions are treated in
                    geographical volumes in this series.</p>
                <p>Documents on national security questions usually involved or were prepared for
                    high-level officials in the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
                    administration, especially the Secretary of State and the President.
                    Occasionally, records documenting lower-level exchanges and discussions were
                    selected to provide more complete coverage of key subject areas.</p>
                <p>The major decisions on national security questions were made by President
                        <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>, usually after
                    recommendations from and discussion in the National Security Council (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>). The most important Presidential records are
                    the relevant White House files at the Dwight D. Eisenhower Library in Abilene,
                    Kansas, to which the editors had complete access. The Eisenhower Library
                    contains, among other important collections, the memoranda of discussion at the
                        <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meetings, usually prepared by Deputy
                    Executive Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GSE1">S. Everett Gleason</persName>,
                    and the memoranda of conferences with the President, prepared by the President’s
                    Staff Secretary, <persName corresp="#p_GCAJ1">Andrew J.
                    Goodpaster</persName>.</p>
                <p>The Department of State’s collections of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                    papers and correspondence are also of the highest value. Some of these documents
                    are available in the central (decimal) files and lot (office) files deposited at
                    the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) in Washington, D.C.
                    Later Department records will be transferred to NARA and made available for
                    scholarly research. <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> materials located in
                    NARA include the numbered <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> papers and related
                    documentation.</p>
                <pb xml:id="pg_V" n="V" facs="0009"/>
                <p>Because White House and Department of State records contain many significant
                    Department of Defense documents, the editors did not seek further access to the
                    Department of Defense files. The editors perused the official papers of the
                    Joint Chiefs of Staff and the manuscript collections of Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Arleigh A. Burke</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Arthur M. Radford</persName>, and General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Nathan F. Twining</persName>.</p>
                <p>The 174 documents printed in this volume furnish an accurate and comprehensive
                    record of basic U.S. national security policy doctrine. To supplement the
                    documents published here, the editors have identified or cited in the annotation
                    many additional documents from the large body of records on U.S. national
                    security policy. Footnotes, for instance, summarize documents that space
                    limitations prevented from publishing, and editorial notes describe other
                    important record collections. In addition to providing readers with a more
                    complete context for the issues, these editorial devices will assist scholars
                    who are interested in undertaking additional research to learn more about the
                    complexities and nuances of the policymaking process on national security
                    matters.</p>
                <p>Some documents originally selected for inclusion in the volume could not be
                    declassified. In particular, documents in the subject areas of nuclear weapons
                    and “finished intelligence”, which comprise interagency analyses of a wide range
                    of national security-related subjects, were withheld in whole or in part. The
                    editors have referenced denied and excised documents in bracketed insertions in
                    the texts of the documents or in the annotation. The exclusions have obviously
                    restricted the coverage of a few subjects, but the editors are confident that
                    the excisions do not compromise the fundamental accuracy of the volume.</p>
                <p>The editors wish to acknowledge the assistance of officials at the Dwight D.
                    Eisenhower Presidential Library, in particular David Haight; the National
                    Archives and Records Administration; the Department of Defense; and other
                    specialized repositories who assisted in the collection of documents for this
                    volume.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>The documents in the volume are presented chronologically according to Washington
                    time. Memoranda of conversations are placed according to the time and. date of
                    the conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the Editor in Chief and the chief technical editor. The source
                    text is reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia or other
                    notations, which are described in footnotes. Obvious typographical errors are
                    corrected, but other mistakes and omissions in the source <pb xml:id="pg_VI" n="VI" facs="0010"/>text are corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction
                    is set in italic type; an omission in roman type. Brackets are also used to
                    indicate text that has been omitted because it deals with an unrelated subject
                    or because it remained classified after the declassification review process. The
                    amount of material not declassified has been quantified by noting the number of
                    words, lines of source text, or pages of source text that were omitted. All
                    ellipses and brackets that appear in the source text are so identified by
                    footnotes.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the document’s source, original
                    classification, distribution, and drafting information. The source footnote also
                    provides the background of important documents and policies and indicates if the
                    President or Secretary of State read the document.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in this volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs of participants and other first-hand accounts has been used where
                    possible to supplement the official record.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Declassification Review Procedures</p>
                <p>Declassification review of the documents selected for publication was conducted
                    by the Division of Historical Documents Review, Bureau of Diplomatic Security,
                    Department of State. The review was made in accordance with the Freedom of
                    Information Act, the Privacy Act, and the criteria established in Executive
                    Order 12356 regarding:</p>
                <list type="ordered">
                    <item>1) military plans, weapons, or operations;</item>
                    <item>2) the vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations,
                        projects, or plans relating to the national security;</item>
                    <item>3) foreign government information;</item>
                    <item>4) intelligence activities (including special activities), or intelligence
                        sources or methods;</item>
                    <item>5) foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States;</item>
                    <item>6) scientific, technological, or economic matters relating to national
                        security;</item>
                    <item>7) U.S. Government programs for safeguarding nuclear materials or
                        facilities;</item>
                    <item>8) cryptology; and</item>
                    <item>9) a confidential source.</item>
                </list>
                <p>Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the appropriate geographic and
                    functional bureaus in the Department of State and of other concerned agencies of
                    the U.S. Government, and communication with foreign governments regarding
                    documents of those governments. <pb xml:id="pg_VII" n="VII" facs="0011"/>The
                    principle of declassification review is to release as much information as is
                    consistent with contemporary requirements of national security and sound foreign
                    relations.</p>
                <p>William Klingaman, David S. Patterson, and Ilana Stern compiled this volume under
                    the supervision of Editor in Chief John P. Glennon. Neal H. Petersen provided
                    initial planning and direction. Rosa Pace assisted with the preparation of the
                    lists of sources, names, and abbreviations. Rita M. Baker of the Editing
                    Division of the Historian’s Office performed the technical editing. Barbara A.
                    Bacon of the Publishing Services Division (Paul M. Washington, Chief) oversaw
                    production of the volume. Catherine Dettmar of Editorial Experts, Inc.,

                            out of Admiral Robbins’ briefing of the President on Soviet net

                                established by <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5423, “Directive

                            The President had asked Admiral Robbins whether he was satisfied about
                            our ability to evaluate Soviet capabilities and to take action to
                            counter them. Admiral Robbins said he was generally satisfied except for
                            one point, namely, our capacity to obviate delay in taking necessary
                            decisions to anticipate and meet a Soviet attack. The President
                            accordingly suggested the appointment of a sub-committee to study this
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>The impression gained from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSJ1">Lay</persName> is that we are expected to concentrate on actions
                            indicative of the intent of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>,
                            which is the one nation capable of physically hurting the US, to engage
                            in hostilities with the US at some point. Such Soviet actions would be
                            of a nature which either (I) directly threaten the US or (II)
                            demonstrated intent to promote a hostile situation within which the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> contemplated hostilities
                            against the US.</p>
                        <p>The President himself carefully drafted the terms of reference of the
                            sub-committee. From his comments to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSJ1">Lay</persName>, the President seems to have had in mind the
                            following:</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Under Category I</hi> the President wishes us to try
                            to anticipate, by a judgment on indications of Soviet hostile intent,
                            the need for immediate U.S. military action to save the U.S. from
                            attack. Our own counter-measures to such established indications would
                            include orders for the evacuation of American cities, for the dispersal
                            of <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>, for mobilization, etc., and for
                            possible U.S. preventive military action. The President indicated that
                            should the need so require, he might be prepared to give advance
                            authority to local commanders to act.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Under Category II</hi> the conditions seem wider in
                            point of time and scope. The President apparently had in mind
                            anticipating, and possibly deterring, by various types of U.S. action,
                            the development of hostile situations which could involve Soviet
                            hostilities against the U.S. Possibly the threat might be of lesser
                            urgency than under Category I and would give time for U.S. preparedness
                            measures, including mobilization and changes in troop dispositions, as
                            well as U.S. diplomatic action. Although the U.S. reaction would
                            encompass measures of a military nature, other accompanying steps would
                            also be open to the U.S., which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSJ1">Lay</persName> felt we should likewise consider. All of our actions
                            under these circumstances would, however, be in the direction of
                            preparing the U.S. for an ultimate military decision, including possibly
                            preventive action against the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to
                            protect the safety of the U.S.</p>

                            Ezra Taft Benson.]</p>
                        <p>Bobby Cutler came in with Colonel <persName corresp="#p_GCAJ1">Goodpaster</persName> early in the morning to discuss the need in
                            their opinion for the President to make an additional statement on the
                            cutback in the armed forces and the reason why. They are fearful, of
                            course, that the Democrats will try to make this an issue in Congress
                            and that <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName> and the Army
                            will try to make a case for a larger number of ground forces. We all
                            agreed that the President should make a statement in which he would say
                            that he made this decision as Commander-in-Chief and that he thought it
                            was the best possible defense plan for the United States, rather than to
                            have some people attack it by saying that it was done only to save money
                            and to help balance the budget; in other words, endangering the security
                            of the nation for political considerations.</p>

                            this with the President, and he agreed to the necessity for making such
                            a statement. I told him there were three or four ways to do it: (1) he
                            could make such a statement at a press conference, but that since we did
                            not plan to hold a press conference this week because of the State of

                            be delayed until the following Wednesday and that might be too late; (2)
                            We could call the White House correspondents into the President’s office
                            and he could give them a fill-in; (3) We could put out a formal
                            statement; (4) We could release an exchange of letters between the
                            President and <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The President chose the latter and recommended that <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s letter say that he was asking

                        <p>At 2 o’clock the President had a joint meeting of the Cabinet and the
                            Republican leaders—Senators <persName corresp="#p_KWF1">Knowland</persName>, Millikin, <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Saltonstall</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BS1">Bridges</persName>; Congressmen <persName corresp="#p_MJWJ1">Martin</persName>, Halleck, Arends, <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen</persName>—to discuss the State of the Union Message. Bryce
                            Harlow gave a summary of each paragraph and a general discussion was
                            held throughout the meeting.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_4" n="4" facs="0028"/>
                        <p>The question of manpower and the armed forces program came up almost
                            immediately when <persName corresp="#p_BS1">Styles Bridges</persName>
                            said he fully expected that this would be the first political attack to
                            be launched by the Democrats. The President said that, as a matter of
                            fact, he had just discussed this with members of his staff and that
                            there was nothing to which he had given so much personal attention since
                            he had been in office as to the defense plans of the nation. He said
                            that our defense plans must keep pace with science and the new
                            developments in warfare; that we must maintain a proper balance with our
                            economic strength.</p>
                        <p>“It is a question,” the President said, “of blunting the threat of attack
                            by establishing an adequate continental defense and building up our
                            guided missiles here at home, and secondly, to emphasize the retaliatory
                            concept of warfare by putting more money into the air and developing a
                            better early warning system. In the kind of war we are faced with, how
                            long do you think it would take us to ship ten divisions to Europe or
                            six to Japan? Enemy submarines would be swarming the seas, and troops at
                            either the port of embarkation or debarkation would be sitting ducks for
                            atomic aerial attack. What we have got to do in our new thinking is to
                            realize that there will be a period when all we can do is to divert
                            disaster. If we have time to do that job and hit back hard, then we can
                            do the rest in time. But unless we do this, gentlemen, take my word for
                            it we are going to be shot to pieces. As a matter of fact, Al Gruenther
                            is very hopeful that we can set up our Reserve program here in this
                            country in a hurry so that he can then go to the European countries and
                            appeal for them to do the same thing. If we have an atomic attack, we
                            will need those Reserves here at home. Can you imagine what would happen
                            in New York or Detroit, or Washington or Pittsburgh or any one of our
                            big cities, if they got hit by an atomic bomb. The Fire and Police
                            forces of those cities would be inadequate to cope with the panic and
                            disaster that would result. That is why we need a disciplined Reserve
                            which could move in immediately to take over and preserve order. We have
                            got to lay this whole program on the line and get the American people to
                            realize what it is all about. I am going to outline these thoughts in a
                            letter to the Secretary of Defense, and you will see Jim Hagerty making
                            it public within a very short time.”</p>

                            another subject.]</p>
                        <p>Off and on during the day <persName corresp="#p_GCAJ1">Goodpaster</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>
                            and I worked on the draft of a letter from the President to <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> outlining the President’s
                            philosophy behind the cut in manpower in the Armed Services. All of us,
                            including the President, feel that it is necessary prior to the State of
                            the Union Message to get a clear-cut statement of the President’s
                            beliefs before the American people. The reason for it is this:</p>
                        <p>Since the manpower cut was announced by the Secretary of Defense in
                            December the Democrats have been chewing at it. They think they have an
                            issue—that they can make an argument to the American people that we are
                            cutting our Armed Services just for budgetary reasons in an attempt to
                            try to save some money. Of course, nothing could be farther from the
                            truth and the reasons we are taking the steps we have is so that we can
                            put more emphasis on nuclear weapons, guided missiles and the Air
                            Force.</p>
                        <p>As the President has said privately many times, it would have been
                            impossible for him to invade the Continent in the way he did if the
                            Germans had had the atomic bomb. The deployment of troops in the ports
                            of debarkation would have been blown off the earth with that bomb and
                            the great mass of ships coming across the Channel would have been
                            actually disintegrated. Consequently in an atomic attack or an atomic
                            war it is going to be virtually impossible to move land troops to Europe
                            or to Asia, and we will have to depend upon long range bombers, guided
                            missiles and the like to carry the attack to the enemy and to stop them
                            from coming over here. In a like manner bombing of our cities is going
                            to create panic and riots within those cities and it is going to be
                            necessary to have a strong ready Reserve to throw into those areas
                            merely to keep order and to get our production going again.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_GCAJ1">Goodpaster</persName> and myself think it is very
                            necessary for the President to say to the American people that he has
                            made these decisions as Commander-in-Chief with his wide background of
                            military affairs—that it is a military decision, not a budgetary one.
                            The President agreed fully with this and after bringing in several
                            drafts of the letter to him, he finally said that this was one he would
                            like to work on alone overnight, and we left it with him with an
                            agreement that we would pick it up from him tomorrow and release it for

                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> position.</p>
                        <p rend="center">II</p>
                        <p>As Section A is in the nature of an intelligence estimate, General
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> will suggest leaving it
                            as it is, without an attempt to have the Council resolve the splits in
                            it. In case any member should wish to have one or more of these points
                            discussed, however, the following brief comments may be helpful:</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Page 1, preliminary para</hi>. This statement, based
                            on the intelligence estimate which follows, should be retained.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Page 2, para</hi>. 6. The version in the main text
                            makes the point necessary to the argument. This is not the place for
                            discussing the composition of the forces necessary to provide the
                            deterrent to aggression.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Page 5, para</hi>. 14. The addition proposed by the
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> unnecessarily singles out one of
                            many aspects and would clutter up the clear-cut listing of Soviet
                            objectives.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Pages 6–7, para</hi>. 17. The discussion of current
                            Soviet policy is balanced and cautious. While pointing out the
                            advantages to the U.S.S.R. of the “peace offensive” and the possible
                            motives behind it, the text also stresses the flexibility of Soviet
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Pages 7–8, para</hi>. 20. The difference between the
                            two versions is largely one of emphasis. While the point necessarily
                            involves speculation, the version in the footnote seems preferable in
                            that it gives more <pb xml:id="pg_8" n="8" facs="0032"/>emphasis to (a)
                            the importance in Soviet calculations of the attitudes of our allies,
                            and (b) continuing Soviet caution in pursuing aggressive policies that
                            might lead to nuclear war.</p>

                        <p>The following are the principal unagreed points in the policy sections of
                            the paper which the Council will be asked to resolve:</p>

                            bracketed words. The phrase “fundamental values and institutions”
                            includes our free enterprise economic system. Inclusion of the reference
                            to the economy proposed by Treasury would set an absolute limit on the
                            basic objective of preserving national security. The point is covered
                            adequately in the statement of basic problem (para. 23).</p>

                            (paras. 7, 8, 14b, 15, 16), it is hard to see how this power can be

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> briefed the Council at
                            some length on the reference report, stressing once again the comments
                            and criticism of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who had reemphasized their
                            earlier views with respect to this proposed basic policy. He then called
                            attention to the various differences of view, and indicated that since
                            this would constitute final <pb xml:id="pg_10" n="10" facs="0034"/>Council consideration of the paper, these differences of view would
                            have to be decided. (A copy of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>’s notes is filed in the minutes of the

                        <p>The first difference of opinion occurred in the introductory paragraph of

                            this paragraph indicated the majority opinion of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning Board that the present Soviet
                            challenge constituted “a peril greater than any the United States has
                            ever before faced.” The President indicated sympathy with the minority
                            point of view represented by the Director, Bureau of the Budget,<note n="7" xml:id="d5fn7">
                                <persName corresp="#p_HRR1">Rowland R. Hughes</persName>.</note> and
                            said that he could see no use in setting forth this peril in comparative
                            terms. It was sufficient to say that this challenge constituted a grave
                            peril to the United States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then pointed out the
                            various remaining differences of view with respect to the intelligence
                            estimate, indicating that while the Council should take note of these
                            differences in judgment, it was not necessary that the Council should
                            resolve such differences. They would remain indicated in the footnotes,
                            as was the case normally with national intelligence estimates.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the body of the paper (Section B, “Outline of U.S. National
                            Strategy”), Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out
                            that the first split view occurred in paragraph 21, which read as
                            follows:</p>

                            the security of the United States, and its fundamental values and

                        </p>
                        <p>The President indicated his belief that the bracketed phrase, which had
                            been proposed by the Treasury member and the Budget adviser of the
                            Planning Board, was superfluous, inasmuch as the U.S. free economy was
                            obviously one of the fundamental values and institutions referred to
                            earlier in this paragraph. Accordingly, the bracketed phrase was
                            deleted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then moved on to
                            paragraph 24, which read as follows:</p>
                        <p>“24. The Soviet bloc-free world conflict can be resolved in accordance
                            with U.S. security interests only through either (a) overthrow of the
                            Soviet regime and its replacement by a government with no expansionist
                            or other objectives inconsistent with U.S. security; or (b) modification
                            of the Soviet system so that its leaders for practical purposes abandon
                            expansionist policies and accept either formal or de facto arrangements
                            consistent with U.S. security interests.”</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_11" n="11" facs="0035"/>
                        <p>He explained that the Joint Chiefs of Staff proposed to insert, after the
                            term “Soviet regime”, the phrase “including the destruction of its
                            international Communist apparatus”. The Planning Board members other
                            than the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> adviser, however, felt that
                            such destruction was included in both policy (a) and policy (b). The
                            idea was thought to be implicit. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that while indeed the thought might be
                            implicit in the paragraph as written, he felt that it was sufficiently
                            important to be made explicit. Accordingly, he had made a redraft of
                            paragraph 24 which took account of the proposal by the Joint Chiefs of
                                Staff.<note n="9" xml:id="d5fn9">This redraft, dated January 4, was
                                prepared for the Secretary by John C. Campbell of the Policy

                        </p>
                        <p>The President inquired what was meant by the term “international
                            Communist apparatus”. Did this refer merely to the local Communist
                            parties in the various countries, or did it include the mechanics by
                            which the Kremlin controlled these parties? It seemed to the President a
                            terrific undertaking for the United States to try to destroy the local
                            Communist parties throughout the world. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> commented that these local Communist
                            parties would wither on the vine if the directing regime in the Kremlin
                            were destroyed. The President, however, doubted the accuracy of this
                            statement, as did Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, who believed that at least some of the local
                            Communist parties would manage to survive the destruction of the Soviet
                            regime.</p>
                        <p>Returning to his earlier thought, the President said that while it might
                            be possible for the United States to “neutralize” the Communist
                            apparatus in the free world, it would be next to impossible to destroy
                            it completely. In accordance with the President’s view, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> suggested the
                            substitution of the term “disrupt” for the term “destroy” in his new
                            draft of paragraph 24, which he proceeded to hand to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>, who read it to the meeting. With
                            this change, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’
                            redraft of paragraph 24 was accepted.<note n="10" xml:id="d5fn10">For

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then turned to paragraph
                            25, reading as follows:</p>
                        <p>“25. The U.S. and its allies have no foreseeable prospect of stopping the
                            growth of Soviet nuclear capabilities and of reducing Soviet armed
                            strength—the core of Communist power—[or of significantly reducing other
                            basic Communist military strength,]<note n="11" xml:id="d5fn11">Bracket

                            with the Soviets or by large-scale military action. The initiation by
                            the U.S. of such action for this purpose is not an acceptable course
                            either to the U.S. or its major allies.”</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_12" n="12" facs="0036"/>
                        <p>The bracketed phrase, he said, had been proposed by the State, Treasury,
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and Budget members of the
                            Planning Board, and referred primarily to the military strength of
                            Communist China and the European satellites.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he was inclined to agree with the sense of the
                            bracketed phrase, since he saw little possibility that other basic
                            Communist military strength could be reduced over the period of the next
                            five years. Accordingly, it was agreed to include the bracketed
                            phrase.</p>
                        <p>The next split occurred in paragraph 27, which read as follows:</p>
                        <p>“27. To carry out effectively this general strategy will require a
                            flexible combination of military, political, economic, propaganda, and
                            covert actions which enables the full exercise of U.S. initiative. These
                            actions must be so coordinated as to reinforce one another. [The
                            concrete goals of general strategy between now and the time when the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has greatly increased nuclear
                            power should be developed as a matter of urgency.]”<note n="12" xml:id="d5fn12">Brackets in the source text.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The bracketed sentence, said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>, had been proposed by the Defense, <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                            members of the Planning board. The other members of the Planning Board
                            believed that this language might seem to indicate the desirability of
                            resorting to armed force between now and the time when the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had greatly increased nuclear power,
                            and these members therefore believed that the sentence was inconsistent
                            with the basic strategy outlined in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            5440/1.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> said that apropos of
                            this paragraph it had seemed to him as he had read through the report
                            that there was inadequate recognition of the necessity of developing
                            concrete programs to meet the Soviet threat with some kind of time-table
                            in mind. The President indicated his belief that there must be a lot of
                            people in the Executive Branch working in the field of formulating
                            programs. Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>
                            pointed out that it was the responsibility of the Operations
                            Coordinating Board<note n="13" xml:id="d5fn13">Established by President

                                mechanism for coordinated interdepartmental implementation of
                                national security policies adopted by the National Security Council
                                and approved by the President. <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> indicated that if <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5440/1 were approved by the President,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> proposed to suggest to
                            the President the appointment of a high-level committee made up of
                            members of the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss>, with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Nelson Rockefeller</persName> as chairman, whose
                            responsibility it would be to work out programs to put this new policy
                            into effect. The President <pb xml:id="pg_13" n="13" facs="0037"/>said
                            that in that case the present report amounted simply to being a
                            directive to this <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> committee.
                            Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> was of the
                            opinion that the work of the committee amounted to drawing up courses of
                            action to carry out the strategy outlined in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5440/1.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> felt that if
                            the term “goals” in the bracketed sentence were changed to read
                            “programs”, the issue could be settled without any misunderstanding that
                            the sentence suggested a resort to armed force. The President said it
                            seemed to him that the Council was now getting into the realm of
                            semantics, but he had no objection to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>’s proposed change, which was
                            subsequently adopted by the Council.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then said that he had
                            overlooked a change which the Secretary of State desired to make in
                            paragraph 26–c, which read:</p>
                        <p>“c. Fostering changes in the character and policies of the Communist
                            regimes by making clear to them available alternatives which are in
                            their basic interests and do not conflict with those of the U.S. and by
                            exploiting differences between such regimes, and their other
                            vulnerabilities, in ways consistent with this strategy.”</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that this,
                            too, might appear to be a matter of semantics, but that he felt that
                            subparagraph c should be rewritten to read as follows:</p>
                        <p>“c. Supplementing a and b above by other actions designed to foster
                            changes in the character and policies of the Soviet–Communist bloc
                            regimes:</p>
                        <p>“(1) By influencing them toward the choice of those alternative lines of
                            action which, while in their national interests, do not conflict with
                            the security interests of the U.S.; and</p>
                        <p>“(2) By exploiting differences between such regimes, and their other
                            vulnerabilities, in ways consistent with this general strategy.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> said that
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ redraft would
                            be improved if our influence was not confined solely to the Communist
                            regime, but was also exerted on the peoples of the Soviet bloc.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> expressed
                            skepticism as to whether popular pressure would succeed in making many
                            significant changes in the Communist regimes. He admitted, however, that
                            we might be able to bring influence to bear to break the captive peoples
                            away from their regimes. The President said that this was also his view,
                            and after further discussion the draft proposed by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> was adopted by the Council
                            subject to language which would indicate that our influence was to be
                            directed not only at the regimes but also at the peoples of the
                            Communist states. Even in dictatorships, said the President, some
                            attention had to be given to public opinion.</p>

                        <p>The next important split, continued Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>, occurred in paragraph 32, which read as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>“32. The United States must also have other ready forces, which, together

                        <p>After explaining his understanding of why the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                            wished to include the bracketed phrase, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> asked General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> if he wished to add anything to this
                            explanation. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName>
                            said that the Joint Chiefs had suggested this language in order to
                            ensure a proper balance of forces in our deployments so that these
                            forces would be able to carry out whatever jobs they had to do.</p>
                        <p>The President indicated that he did not care one way or another, and that
                            it was all right to include the bracketed phrase if the Joint Chiefs so
                            desired.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> inquired about
                            the last sentence of the paragraph, dealing with initial tasks in the
                            event of general war. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> wondered whether this implied that the United
                            States must have forces in being capable of carrying out all subsequent
                            as well as all initial tasks in the event of general war.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> indicated that this was
                            not the intention of the authors of the paragraph, but Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> likewise expressed
                            concern lest this phraseology appear to open the door to the return of
                            the concept of balanced forces “for all purposes everywhere”. Up to now
                            this Administration had made clear its belief in the idea of selectivity
                            in the composition of its armed forces, and it would be a bad mistake to
                            abandon the principle of selectivity for that of balance. Along the same
                            lines, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed
                            out that the President had only recently informed the Congressional
                            leaders that the Administration’s military program would ensure forces
                            adequate for the initial tasks of general war, but that it would not be
                            necessary for the United States to have ready and in being at the outset
                            of general war all the military forces it might need subsequently in the
                            course of prosecuting such a war.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_15" n="15" facs="0039"/>
                        <p>The President said that he did not understand the connection of the
                            problem being discussed with the disputed language in the bracketed
                            phrase. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out to
                            the President that it was not to the term “versatility” that Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> objected, but to the
                            idea of forces “to meet aggression in all its forms”. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> was quite correct, and
                            that what he feared was that complete coverage to meet every kind of
                            future military contingency was creeping back into our thinking. He most
                            strenuously objected to the concept of forces in being to meet every
                            possible kind of emergency. If we accepted such an idea we would be “all
                            over the lot again”.</p>
                        <p>As Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> was suggesting a
                            revision to meet Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>’s point, the President turned to Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> and said what you
                            mean is that we should continue to adhere to our basic doctrine of the
                            so-called “new look”. When Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> agreed, the President said that he still did
                            not see any suggestion of changing the new look concept of the bracketed
                            phrase.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> said that perhaps the
                            Chiefs of Staff desired to comment on this issue. Admiral Carney and
                            General <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName> both expressed a
                            desire to speak. General <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName>
                            spoke first, [7 lines of source text not declassified]. To recapture and
                            hold such large areas would require the deployment of considerable
                            ground forces. That is what versatility meant to him, said General
                                <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName>—“ground forces ready
                            to do this kind of job.”</p>
                        <p>Expressing a measure of agreement with General <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName>’s reasoning, the President
                            nevertheless argued that the kind of situation described by General
                                <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName> as possible [<hi rend="italic">2 words not declassified</hi>] would almost certainly
                            call for partial mobilization by the United States. The job [<hi rend="italic">7 words not declassified</hi>] couldn’t be done by a
                            regimental combat team and three or four Marine battalions. On the other
                            hand, it was impossible to have sufficient ground forces in being to
                            meet every kind of military contingency everywhere in the world. Partial
                            mobilization would have to be the answer. General <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName> replied by pointing out that
                            speed of deployment would be of the essence in many such contingencies.
                            Accordingly, we must have at least certain forces in being to meet such
                            situations. Our ground forces, at least, were growing very small in
                            number. He was not, insisted General <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName>, arguing, as Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said, that it was necessary
                            for us to have every variety of military force in being all the
                            time.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that he
                            certainly was not in favor of earmarking this division or that division
                            for future use in each of the various places in the world where
                            divisions might some time be <pb xml:id="pg_16" n="16" facs="0040"/>needed. What he did favor was having mobile forces at hand and ready
                            to go to different parts of the world as the situation might
                            require.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Carney said that, speaking from the point of view of the Navy, he
                            felt that if we tailored all our military forces to a single concept of
                            warfare, it would be unsound. The U.S. forces should have sufficient
                            versatility to enable them to meet various circumstances short of
                            general war, as well as general war itself.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then suggested a further
                            revision of this paragraph to take account of the discussion. This was
                            adopted, with a comment by the President that he had always imagined
                            that military forces were by their very nature presumed to be
                            versatile.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then indicated that the
                            next split occurred in paragraph 35, which read as follows:</p>
                        <p>“35. The United States and its allies must reject the concept of
                            preventive war or acts intended to provoke war. [The United States and
                            its allies will also have to forego actions regarded as provocative, if
                            such actions would foreclose the requisite support for the use of force
                            should this become necessary. Moreover, it the Communist rulers should
                            conclude that the United States is bent on aggressive war, they may feel
                            that they have no choice but to initiate war themselves at their own
                            time. Hence, the United States should attempt to make clear, by word and
                            conduct, that it is not our intention to provoke war.]<note n="15" xml:id="d5fn15">Brackets in the source text.</note> At the same time
                            the United States and its major allies must make clear their
                            determination to oppose aggression despite risk of general war, and the
                            United States must make clear its determination to prevail if general
                            war eventuates.”</p>
                        <p>As soon as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> had finished
                            reading paragraph 35, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen
                                Dulles</persName> indicated his desire to withdraw the support given
                            by the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> member of the Planning Board
                            to the bracketed sentences in this paragraph.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he found it very difficult to understand the
                            contents in the bracketed phrase apart from specific situations which
                            might arise. He felt that the wording was much too speculative.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he was
                            quite prepared to see both the first and the second sentence in the
                            bracketed portion of the paragraph deleted. The other members of the
                            Council promptly agreed.</p>
                        <p>Apropos of paragraphs 39, 40, 41 and 42, dealing with economic
                            assistance, particularly to less developed areas, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> noted that the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff desired to include somewhere in these paragraphs reference to the
                            desirability of ensuring a better supply of food to such areas. He
                            indicated that the Planning Board had been <pb xml:id="pg_17" n="17" facs="0041"/>reluctant to adopt the suggestion of the Joint Chiefs
                            of Staff because it singled out only one of many items of economic
                            assistance, although they had no objection to the proposal in
                            itself.</p>
                        <p>The President, disagreeing with the Planning Board, said he thought that
                            the Joint Chiefs of Staff had “got something” on this point. Adequate
                            food, he said, was more conducive to good morale than almost anything
                            else he knew, citing as an illustration the powerful effect of the
                            10-pound food packages which Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> had distributed at Christmas. In accordance with
                            the President’s view, the Council agreed to include a specific reference
                            to providing adequate dietary conditions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> went on to point out
                            that at the end of paragraph 42, which dealt with economic assistance to
                            underdeveloped areas, there was a division in the Planning Board. The
                            Treasury and Budget members of the Planning Board desired to add a final
                            sentence which read: “The total level of U.S. economic assistance
                            worldwide should, however, be progressively reduced.” Although, said Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>, this language was
                            taken from the “Guidelines Under <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                                162/2”,<note n="16" xml:id="d5fn16">See <ref target="#d4fn9">footnote 9</ref>, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note> the
                            other members of the Planning Board had been disinclined to include it
                            in the present paper.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that he
                            thought it most desirable from every point of view to include the
                            sentence in question. The President, turning to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, said that the real criterion
                            with respect to the level of U.S. economic assistance was the security
                            advantage which the United States obtained. He pointed out that U.S.
                            economic assistance to Turkey was the best possible way to buttress our
                            security interests in the Near Eastern area. Moreover, it was much
                            better and cheaper to assist the Turks to build up their own armed
                            forces than to create additional U.S. divisions.</p>
                        <p>The Director of the Budget also believed that the sentence in question
                            should be included, if for no other reason than if it were left out,
                            those who were not familiar with the point of view of the Administration
                            might misinterpret the omission.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> suggested a
                            revision of the disputed sentence which would read that the total level
                            of U.S. economic assistance “should be reduced as rapidly as is
                            consistent with U.S. security interests.” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRR1">Hughes</persName> indicated that this revision was
                            satisfactory to him. Our policy has been going in the direction of
                            reducing the level of our economic assistance, and we certainly did not
                            wish to change directions now. The President, however, reiterated that
                            the first criterion with respect to the level of U.S. assistance was the
                            vital interests and the security of the United States.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_18" n="18" facs="0042"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then said he
                            wished to raise another point contained in paragraph 42. He referred to
                            the sentence which read: “Specifically, the U.S. should support a new
                            initiative, in which industrialized free world nations and
                            underdeveloped nations of Asia would both participate, aimed at
                            significant economic improvement in South and Southeast Asia, where the
                            Communist threat is especially dangerous.” Apropos of this sentence,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he
                            sometimes worried over the great emphasis we were putting on economic
                            assistance to South and Southeast Asia. There was almost as much danger
                            from Communism in the Americas. Accordingly, should we single out the
                            areas of South and Southeast Asia for special mention? To the United
                            States itself, the situation in the Americas was more dangerous than the
                            situation in Southeast Asia, although, of course, this was not the case

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> suggested deletion of
                            this sentence, but Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> expressed some reluctance at this proposal. He
                            pointed out that we can effect changes in any situation in the Americas
                            without being obliged to resort to general war. If, on the other hand,
                            we were to lose Burma to Communism, we could only regain it by resorting
                            to war.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName> inquired, with
                            respect to paragraph 42, whether it was the intent of this paragraph to
                            suggest that money and money alone could develop sounder economic
                            conditions in the backward areas. If so, the argument was erroneous, for
                            there were a variety of other means for improving economic
                            conditions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> explained that the point
                            raised by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName> was
                            covered in paragraph 41, and again suggested the omission of the
                            sentence to which Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had taken exception. Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> then inquired whether omission
                            of this sentence would constitute a change in the recently adopted U.S.
                            policy toward the Far East (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>

                                <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> indicated his
                            approval for deletion of this sentence.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> then observed that by
                            and large the present report nowhere gave sufficient emphasis to the
                            information, cultural, education and exchange programs. The President
                            agreed that these programs had not been mentioned, but said that he
                            presumed that they would be included in the programs subsequently
                            formulated to carry out the policy and strategy in the present
                            paper.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he
                            wished to express his complete agreement with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName> that there had been in the
                            past too great emphasis on financial and economic assistance to friendly
                            nations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>
                            expressed agreement with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, <pb xml:id="pg_19" n="19" facs="0043"/>and cited
                            the case of Italy to prove his point. Very large sums in the <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">shape</gloss> of U.S. assistance had been poured
                            into Italy without any notable effect on the level of Communist strength
                            and membership. Economic aid, said Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>, was
                            obviously important; but it was not the whole answer to our problems.
                            Both Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> and the
                            President expressed agreement with these views. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> suggested that this idea
                            deserved a new paragraph, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> agreed that it would be desirable to include a
                            new paragraph dealing with cultural and ideological matters. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> said that such a
                            paragraph would be inserted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then asked the Council
                            to look at paragraph 49–b, dealing with a sound U.S. economy and reading
                            as follows:</p>
                        <p>“The Federal Government should continue to make a determined effort to
                            bring its total annual expenditures into balance, or into substantial
                            balance, with its total annual revenues, and should maintain overall
                            credit and fiscal policies designed to assist in stabilizing the
                            economy.”</p>
                        <p>He then went on to explain that Dr. Burns<note n="18" xml:id="d5fn18">Arthur F. Burns, Chairman, Council of Economic Advisers.</note> had
                            been unable to be present, and wished him to convey Dr. Burns’ views as
                            to this paragraph. Dr. Burns said that from a technical point of view it
                            would be more correct to delete the word “annual” before “expenditures”
                            and “revenues”. On the other hand, he would not recommend deletion at
                            this time, since if we were now to tinker with the language people would
                            put the wrong construction on the change.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he
                            wished to suggest a further revision of this paragraph, designed to make
                            clear that revenues alone were not the absolute criterion. Obviously we
                            would like revenues and expenditures to be in balance, but sometimes,
                            said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, it was
                            every bit as important to find revenues to meet expenses as it was to
                            cut expenditures in order to meet revenues. Accordingly, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> believed that the
                            language should read “to bring its total annual expenditures and its
                            total annual revenues into balance, or substantial balance”.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> indicated that
                            he would not object to the proposed language unless it meant that we
                            were now contemplating going before Congress and asking an increase in
                            taxes. Of course, under different world conditions, it might be
                            necessary to do this. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> just what he proposed to do if he failed to
                            prevent Congress from slashing the excise taxes in the next session. Did
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> propose to cut
                            national defense expenditures if the excise taxes were thrown out by the
                            Congress? As the President was expressing his agreement with the <pb xml:id="pg_20" n="20" facs="0044"/>position taken by the Secretary
                            of State, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>
                            answered by saying that if in the next session of Congress we got a big
                            cut in our revenues, we would have to take a good hard look both at our
                            revenues and at our expenditures.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> indicated that he
                            also would go along with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ view, adding that under certain conditions he
                            would vote for a deficit. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> replied that so would he, but certainly not
                            under present conditions. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> again proposed the phraseology “bring its total
                            annual revenues and expenditures into balance”. The President said isn’t
                            that what the present paragraph means substantially? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRR1">Hughes</persName> said that as far as he could
                            see, it didn’t mean anything really different but, once again, new
                            language may give rise to misunderstandings. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> thought that it was rather a
                            question of difference of implication than a matter of exact meaning.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> counselled
                            against changing the phraseology if we really didn’t mean to change our
                            concrete objective. The President said that in any case we must never
                            fail to emphasize that the United States will do what it has to do to
                            protect its security. Whatever language is adopted should leave no doubt
                            on this point. The Council thereupon adopted the language suggested by
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, with respect to
                            paragraph 49–d, reading as follows:</p>
                        <p>“d. [The aggregate of Federal expenditures, not essential to the national
                            security, should be minimized.] [Federal expenditures, especially those
                            not essential for the national security, should be held to a necessary
                                minimum].”<note n="19" xml:id="d5fn19">All brackets in this
                                paragraph are in the source text.</note> Every effort should be made
                            to eliminate waste, duplication, and unnecessary overhead in the Federal
                            Government.“</p>
                        <p>The Council after some discussion adopted a revision suggested by Dr.
                            Burns, to the effect that all Federal expenditures, especially those not
                            essential for the national security, should be held to the necessary
                            minimum.</p>
                        <p>As the Council was concluding its discussion of the report, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> noted that at the end
                            of the report there were paragraphs dealing with the importance of an
                            adequate intelligence system, manpower, research and development, etc..
                            Pointing out that he had mentioned at earlier meetings of the Council
                            the lack of an adequate U.S. organization to deal with the Communist
                            tactics of subversion in free world nations, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> inquired whether there should
                            not be specific mention at this point of the necessity of strong
                            governmental backing to solve this problem. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>, in response, referred to
                            a paper on the subject which he was about to present to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName>.<note n="20" xml:id="d5fn20">Not found in the Eisenhower Library or Department of
                                State files.</note> Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, however, was still of the opinion that <pb xml:id="pg_21" n="21" facs="0045"/>this problem deserved mention in
                            this report. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>
                            said that he would in that case be glad to prepare such a paragraph,
                            which could then be considered by the other Council members. The
                            President expressed approval of this proposal.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of the discussion of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5440/1, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> indicated that the President had a related matter
                            which he wished to bring up for Council discussion and advice. The
                            President then held up a manuscript which he said was the draft of a
                            letter to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> in
                            reply to a note from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> asking for a Presidential statement for public
                            release relative to the military program for the next fiscal year.<note n="21" xml:id="d5fn21">See <ref target="#d3fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                    3</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The President then explained that what he had been trying to do was to
                            put in language that could be clearly understood the position which the
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> had recommended and on which he
                            had decided, as to what our security required from the military point of
                            view. This would be most valuable for future discussions with the
                            Congress, and he wanted to be sure that he had a convincing and succinct
                            statement of the Administration’s position on this subject, and one
                            which could be published without injuring the national security. The
                            President then read his draft letter, after which various members of the
                            Council, including Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, Secretary Stevens, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, all made suggestions for the
                            President’s consideration in revising the present draft of the letter.
                            Much of this discussion centered about the level to which the armed
                            forces of the United States should be reduced, as a goal for the end of
                            the Fiscal Year 1956. The President, on this subject, told Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> to be prepared to
                            defend a figure of 2,850,000.<note n="22" xml:id="d5fn22">An increase of

                        <p>1. Soviet air-atomic capabilities are rapidly increasing. Already the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has the capacity to inflict
                            widespread devastion on major free world countries allied to the U.S.
                            and serious damage to the U.S. itself. Over approximately the next five
                            years the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will almost certainly
                            develop the <hi rend="italic">net</hi> capability to strike a crippling

                        <p>2. At present the U.S. can inflict massive damage on the Communist bloc
                            by nuclear striking power. Even when the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> arrives at the point where it can strike a crippling
                            blow at the U.S., the U.S. will still be able to inflict equal or
                            greater damage on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, provided
                            that it takes adequate measures to protect its effective retaliatory
                            power.</p>
                        <p>3. The Soviet guided missile program, over the next few years, will bring
                            increasingly longer-range missiles into production. Assuming an
                            intensive effort, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> may develop
                            roughly by 1963 (1960 at the earliest) operational intercontinental
                            ballistic missiles. The U.S. program for missiles of this type should
                            approximate this timetable, provided that intensive effort continues.
                            There is no known defense against such missiles at this time.</p>
                        <p>4. Thus a situation is appoaching in which a total war involving use by
                            both sides of available weapons would bring about such extensive
                            destruction as to threaten the survival of both Western civilization and
                            the Soviet system. This situation could create a condition of mutual
                            deterrence, in which each side would be strongly inhibited from
                            deliberately initiating general war or taking actions which it regarded
                            as materially increasing the risk of general war. In any case, war would
                            remain a possibility, if only because of the element of miscalculation
                            by either side or because of a technological break-through by the
                            Soviets leading them to believe they could destroy the U.S. without
                            effective retaliation.</p>
                        <p>5. The Communist bloc will maintain and further develop formidable
                            conventional forces, with improved combat effectiveness and a large
                            increase in submarines. The principal limitations will be logistic
                            problems and deficiencies in specialized experience, training and
                            equipment.</p>
                        <p>6. The free world can make substantial progress in building military
                            strength through the continued improvement of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces, the introduction of West German units, some
                            Japanese rearmament, and the progressive development of new weapons
                            systems and of production facilities. Introduction of nuclear weapons
                            into the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defense system on the
                            basis of agreed policy will be of crucial importance. <hi rend="italic">Provided that</hi> it has the will to do so, the free world
                            coalition has the capacity to maintain sufficient conventional and

                                adequate and timely reinforcement, along with U.S. strategic nuclear

                            aggression and to maximize the chances of dealing effectively with such
                            aggression if it should occur.</p>

                        <p>7. The stability of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and its
                            hold over the European satellites are unlikely to be seriously shaken
                            over the next few years, despite measures which the U.S. may find it
                            feasible to take to weaken Soviet control. However, the control system
                            of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will continue to be faced
                            with important problems (such as discontent in the satellites,
                            agricultural difficulties, and pressures for satisfying consumer wants),
                            some of which may be susceptible to a limited degree of exploitation
                            from outside.</p>
                        <p>8. Communist China is likely to continue vigorous and cohesive, but will
                            face internal problems much greater than those of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The Sino-Soviet tie probably will
                            remain strong for the next few years not only for ideological reasons
                            but also because it furthers the purposes of both parties.</p>
                        <p>9. In absolute terms, the growth of the U.S. economy should be greater
                            than that of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>; and U.S.
                            productive capacity in 1959 will still be more than twice that of the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Nevertheless, the economic
                            growth of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> can be expected to
                            continue at a rate considerably higher than that of the U.S. or of other
                            major free world countries. The difference in growth rates will probably
                            be even greater in the industrial sector, despite some increased Soviet
                            emphasis on agriculture and consumer goods. Moreover, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will be devoting to capital
                            investment, and to uses contributing to war potential, a much greater
                            proportion of its resources.</p>
                        <p>10. Soviet economic progress, in spite of the fact that Soviet living
                            standards are low compared to those of the U.S., will be for many
                            peoples with lower living standards an impressive example, and will
                            probably constitute an important element in spreading Soviet influence,
                            especially in Asia. Communist China, if its industrialization continues
                            as expected at a rate relatively rapid as compared with that of other
                            Asian countries, will also exert considerable attractive force on Asian
                            peoples, especially if economic improvement in free Asia is slow or
                            non-existent.</p>
                        <p>11. The existing structure of U.S. alliances can probably be maintained,
                            and could possibly be extended, particularly in the Middle East.
                            However, there will be serious strains on these alliances, especially
                            the ties between the U.S. and its major allies, resulting from growing
                            fears of atomic war on the part of the allies, differing attitudes on
                            China, and greater receptivity by the allies to Soviet overtures. Our
                            allies will probably be more reluctant than the U.S. to participate in
                            actions which appear to them to involve appreciable risks of war in
                            order to prevent further Communist advances in areas which do not
                            directly involve their vital interests.</p>
                        <p>12. Less developed countries will continue to be a major source of
                            weakness in the position of the free world, owing to such factors as
                            political instability, economic backwardness, extreme nationalism, and
                                <pb xml:id="pg_28" n="28" facs="0052"/>the colonial issue. The
                            dangers of subversion will be great, especially in countries under the
                            shadow of Communist power and subject to direct Communist pressures and
                            intervention. In Southeast Asia the present situation is extremely
                            precarious. Failure of the free world to deal more effectively with the
                            problems of less developed areas will weaken the free world and benefit
                            international communism, even in countries where actual Communist
                            take-over is not imminent.</p>
                        <p>13. As the lines between the Communist bloc and the Western coalition
                            have come to be more clearly drawn over the last few years, a situation
                            has arisen in which any further Communist territorial gain would have an
                            unfavorable impact within the free world that might be out of all
                            proportion to the strategic or economic significance of the territory
                            lost.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II Probable Soviet and Chinese Communist
                            Intentions and Strategy</p>
                        <p>14. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has not modified its basic
                            hostility toward the non-Communist world, and especially toward the U.S.
                            as the power center of that world, or its belief in the ultimate triumph
                            of Communism. The Soviet leaders can be expected to seek constantly, by
                            every means they find advantageous, to extend Communist power and to
                            weaken those forces, especially U.S. power and influence, which they
                            regard as inexorable enemies of their system. However, they will almost
                            certainly avoid pursuing their long-term goals in ways which jeopardize
                            the security of the regime or their control of the Communist bloc.
                            Soviet objectives can be listed as follows, in descending order of
                            importance:</p>
                        <p>a. The security of the regime and of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>b. Maintaining the Soviet hold on the European satellites, and keeping

                        <p>c. Elimination of U.S. influence from Eurasia, and the isolation of the
                            U.S.</p>
                        <p>d. Expansion of Soviet Communist power throughout Eurasia.</p>
                        <p>e. Elimination of the U.S. as a competing power center.</p>

                        <p>15. The Chinese Communist regime remains bitterly hostile to the U.S.,
                            and ostensibly committed to the conquest of Formosa. It will attempt to
                            expand its power on the mainland of Asia and to expel U.S. power and
                            influence therefrom. In pursuit of this end, it probably will place
                            primary emphasis on penetration and support of subversion in neighboring
                            countries.</p>

                        <p>16. Provided that the U.S. and free world have at all times an adequate
                            military posture and the necessary determination, it appears unlikely
                            that, within the next five years, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or Communist China will deliberately initiate war, or
                            engage in overt military aggression if in its judgment such aggression
                            would involve appreciable risk of war with the U.S.<note n="8" xml:id="d6fn8">An important possible exception to this estimate is a
                                Chinese Communist attack on Formosa and the Pescadores. The Chinese
                                Communists will almost certainly increase their probing actions
                                against the Nationalist-held off-shore islands and will probably try
                                to seize them, if they believe this can be done without bringing on

                            in their judgment will clearly involve such risk. However, they probably
                            would not be deterred by the risk of general war from taking military
                            counter-action against Western actions considered to be an imminent
                            threat to their security. Moveover, general war might occur as the
                            climax of a series of actions and counter-actions which neither side
                            originally intended to lead to that result.</p>
                        <p>17. The emergence of increased flexibility in the conduct of Soviet
                            foreign policy since the death of Stalin has introduced a significant
                            new factor in the situation. The Soviet leaders have almost certainly
                            regarded their “peace offensive” as their most effective present tactic
                            for dividing the free world and isolating the U.S. from its allies. A
                            principal aim has been to prevent the rearmament of West Germany in
                            association with the Western Powers. If the Paris agreements are
                            ratified, the Soviets may revert to a more uncompromising and menacing
                            posture. On the other hand, the “soft” line may further be motivated by
                            domestic preoccupation and fear of general war, and the Soviets may,
                            therefore, desire an extended period of reduced tensions, without
                            sacrificing their basic security interests. Even should that be the
                            case, Soviet policy will mainly seek tacit understanding not to resort
                            to force to change the present territorial division between the
                            Communist bloc and the free world. In any event, whatever Soviet
                            concessions are made will, for some time, almost certainly be confined
                            to relatively minor issues. Although it appears very unlikely, the
                            Soviet leaders might be led by the fear of nuclear destruction to accept
                            an effective system of armaments control, with whatever changes would
                            thereby be required in their present practices and concepts.<note n="9" xml:id="d6fn9">The Joint Chiefs of Staff believe this paragraph
                                over-stresses the significance of the present Soviet “soft” tactics
                                as indicative of a possible basic shift in the Soviet policy; the
                                Soviets have recently demonstrated that this “soft” tactic is
                                subject to radical reversal whenever it suits their interest.

                        <p>18. Whenever the Soviet “soft” line is dominant, our allies will be eager
                            to explore it seriously, and will probably wish, in seeking a basis of
                            “coexistence”, to go to further lengths than the U.S. will find prudent.

                            unity and resolution in the free world coalition whenever and wherever
                            the Soviets press their “peace offensive”.</p>
                        <p>19. Despite the talk of “coexistence”, the Communist powers will continue
                            strenuous efforts to weaken and disrupt free-world strength and unity
                            and to expand the area of their control, principally by subversion
                            (including the support of insurrection), while avoiding involvement of
                            the main sources of Communist power. This strategy will probably present
                            the free world with its most serious challenge and greatest danger in
                            the next few years.</p>
                        <p>20. Attainment by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> of the
                            capacity to inflict crippling damage on the U.S. almost certainly would
                            not tempt the Soviets to initiate general war, unless they believed that
                            they could neutralize, or by initial surprise could destroy, U.S.
                            retaliatory power before it could be used. They will continue to be
                            extremely reluctant to precipitate a contest in which the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would be likely to be subjected even
                            to limited nuclear attack. After attaining atomic plenty, however, the
                            Communist powers probably will increase the pace of their attempts at
                            progressive local expansion, supported by force or threat of force,
                            provided they estimate that such action can succeed and will not provoke

                            policy is to preserve the security of the United States, and its
                            fundamental values and institutions.</p>

                        <p>23. <hi rend="italic">The basic problem</hi> confronting the U.S. is how,
                            without undermining fundamental U.S. values and institutions or
                            seriously weakening the U.S. economy, to meet and ultimately to diminish
                            this threat to U.S. security.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_31" n="31" facs="0055"/>
                        <p>24. In meeting this threat, the U.S. must choose between two main lines
                            of policy, aimed respectively at:</p>
                        <p>a. Destroying the power of the Soviet-Communist bloc; or</p>
                        <p>b. Modifying the policies of the Soviet-Communist bloc along lines more
                            compatible with U.S. security interests.</p>
                        <p>Either policy would include action to disrupt or neutralize the
                            international Communist apparatus in the free world.</p>
                        <p>25. The U.S. and its allies have no foreseeable prospect of stopping the
                            growth of Soviet nuclear capabilities and of reducing Soviet armed
                            strength—the core of Communist power—or of significantly reducing other
                            basic Communist military strength, except by mutually acceptable
                            agreements with the Soviets or by large-scale military action. The
                            initiation by the U.S. of such action for this purpose is not an
                            acceptable course either to the U.S. or its major allies.</p>
                        <p>26. Hence, U.S policies must be designed to affect the conduct of the
                            Communist regimes, especially that of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, in ways that further U.S. security interests and to
                            encourage tendencies that lead them to abandon expansionist policies. In
                            pursuing this general strategy, our effort should be directed to:</p>
                        <p>a. Deterring further Communist aggression, and preventing the occurrence
                            of total war so far as compatible with U.S. security.</p>
                        <p>b. Maintaining and developing in the free world the mutuality of interest
                            and common purpose, and the necessary will, strength and stability, to
                            face the Soviet-Communist threat and to provide constructive and
                            attractive alternatives to Communism, which sustain the hope and
                            confidence of free peoples.</p>
                        <p>c. Supplementing a and b above by other actions designed to foster
                            changes in the character and policies of the Soviet-Communist bloc
                            regimes:</p>
                        <p>(1) By influencing them and their peoples toward the choice of those
                            alternative lines of action which, while in their national interests, do
                            not conflict with the security interests of the U.S.; and</p>
                        <p>(2) By exploiting differences between such regimes, and their other
                            vulnerabilities, in ways consistent with this general strategy.</p>
                        <p>27. To carry out effectively this general strategy will require a
                            flexible combination of military, political, economic, propaganda, and
                            covert actions which enables the full exercise of U.S. initiative. These
                            actions must be so coordinated as to reinforce one another. Programs for
                            the general strategy between now and the time when the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has greatly increased nuclear power
                            should be developed as a matter of urgency.</p>
                        <p>28. Provided that it is resolutely pursued, this general strategy offers
                            the best hope of bringing about at least a prolonged period of armed
                            truce, and ultimately a peaceful resolution of the Soviet bloc-free <pb xml:id="pg_32" n="32" facs="0056"/>world conflict and a peaceful and
                            orderly world environment. Failure resolutely to pursue this gerneral
                            strategy could, within a relatively short span of years, place the U.S.
                            in great jeopardy.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Section C</p>
                        <p rend="center">Elements of National Strategy</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. Military Problem</p>
                        <p>29. A central aim of U.S. policy must be to deter the Communists from use
                            of their military power, remaining prepared to fight general war should
                            one be forced upon the U.S. This stress on deterrence is dictated by the
                            disastrous character of total nuclear war, the possibility of local
                            conflicts developing into total war, and the serious effect of further
                            Communist aggression. Hence the Communist rulers must be convinced that
                            aggression will not serve their interests: that it will not pay.</p>
                        <p>30. If this purpose is to be achieved, the U.S. and its allies in the
                            aggregate will have to have, for an indefinite period, military forces
                            with sufficient strength, flexibility and mobility to enable them to
                            deal swiftly and severely with Communist overt aggression in its various
                            forms and to cope successfully with general war should it develop. In
                            addition, the U.S. and its major allies must show that they are united
                            in their determination to use military force against such
                            aggression.</p>
                        <p>31. As part of its military forces, the U.S. must develop and maintain
                            its effective nuclear-air retaliatory power, and must keep that power
                            secure from neutralization or from a Soviet knockout blow, even by
                            surprise. The U.S. must also continue accelerated military and
                            non-military programs for continental defense. So long as the Soviets
                            are uncertain of their ability to neutralize the U.S. nuclear-air
                            retaliatory power, there is little reason to expect them to initiate
                            general war or actions which they believe would carry appreciable risk
                            of general war, and thereby endanger the regime and the security of the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>32. The United States must also have other ready forces, which, together
                            with those of its allies, must be sufficient (a) to help deter any
                            resort to local aggression, or (b) to punish swiftly and severely any
                            such local aggression, in a manner and on a scale best calculated to
                            avoid the hostilities broadening into total nuclear war. Such ready
                            forces will be in addition to those assigned to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>; they must be properly balanced, sufficiently
                            versatile, suitably deployed, highly mobile, and equipped as appropriate
                            with atomic capability, to perform these tasks; and must also, along
                            with those assigned to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, be capable
                            of discharging initial tasks in the event of general war.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_33" n="33" facs="0057"/>
                        <p>33. Such a policy is predicated upon the support and cooperation of
                            appropriate major allies and certain other free world countries, in
                            furnishing bases for U.S. military power, especially strategic air, and
                            in providing their share of military forces. To succeed, the basic
                            strategy and policy of the U.S. must be believed by our appropriate
                            major allies generally to serve their security as well as ours. Thus, it
                            is important for the United States to take the necessary steps to
                            convince them that such is the case, to strengthen the collective
                            defense system, and to utilize, where appropriate, the possibilities of
                            collective action through the UN. In addition, the United States should
                            continue to provide military and other assistance to dependable allied
                            nations where such assistance is necessary to enable them to make their
                            appropriate contributions to collective military power.</p>
                        <p>34. The ability to apply force selectively and flexibly will become
                            increasingly important in maintaining the morale and will of the free
                            world to resist aggression. As the fear of nuclear war grows, the United
                            States and its allies must never allow themselves to get into the
                            position where they must choose between (a) not responding to local
                            aggression and (b) applying force in a way which our own people or our
                            allies would consider entails undue risk of nuclear devastation.
                            However, the United States cannot afford to preclude itself from using
                            nuclear weapons even in a local situation, if such use will bring the
                            aggression to a swift and positive cessation, and if, on a balance of
                            political and military consideration, such use will best advance U.S.
                            security interests. In the last analysis, if confronted by the choice of
                            (a) acquiescing in Communist aggression or (b) taking measures risking
                            either general war or loss of allied support, the United States must be
                            prepared to take these risks if necessary for its security.</p>
                        <p>35. The United States and its allies must reject the concept of
                            preventive war or acts intended to provoke war. Hence, the United States
                            should attempt to make clear, by word or conduct, that it is not our
                            intention to provoke war. At the same time the United States and its
                            major allies must make clear their determination to oppose aggression
                            despite risk of general war, and the United States must make clear its
                            determination to prevail if general war eventuates.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II Strengthening the Free World</p>
                        <p>36. The United States should place more stress than heretofore on
                            building the strength and cohesion of the free world, and take adequate
                            actions for the purpose of (a) creating cohesion within and among all
                            the free nations, remedying their weaknesses, and steadily improving the
                            relative position of the free world; and (b) destroying the
                            effectiveness of the Communist apparatus in the free world. Success <pb xml:id="pg_34" n="34" facs="0058"/>in these endeavors will depend
                            heavily on the degree to which the U.S. and its major allies can attain
                            agreement on basic objectives and actions to achieve them.</p>
                        <p>37. Direct action against the Communist apparatus must rest largely with
                            the local governments concerned, although the U.S. should be able to
                            help significantly, chiefly through covert means. In countries
                            vulnerable to subversion, the U.S. should, as one of its objectives,
                            assist in the development of adequate internal security forces. In case
                            of an imminent or actual Communist seizure of control, the U.S. should
                            take all feasible political, economic, and covert measures to thwart it,
                            and, it appropriate, should take military action, if required to cope
                            with the situation.</p>
                        <p>38. Recognizing that the Soviet bloc is at present stressing and
                            effectively utilizing subversive forces and techniques, the US. should
                            strengthen its effort against such forces and techniques by developing
                            and employing in a well-coordinated manner all means at its disposal
                            appropriate to this purpose, specifically including covert operations
                            and other pertinent political information, economic, and military
                            programs and activities. [<hi rend="italic">1 sentence (22 words) not

                        <p>39. The existence of conditions in the free world which the Communists
                            can exploit makes it very difficult for the free world to overcome its
                            divisions, fears, and weaknesses. In many cases, the U.S. faces the
                            choice of (a) taking timely action to help remedy such conditions, or of
                            (b) allowing the situation to deteriorate with the prospect of later
                            trying to prevent Communist gains by more costly and less certain
                            measures, or even military action. The ability of the free world, over
                            the long pull, to meet the challenge and competition of the Communist
                            world will depend in large measure on the capacity to demonstrate
                            progress toward meeting the basic needs and aspirations of its
                            peoples.</p>
                        <p>40. Two of the basic problems in the economic field are: (a)
                            industrialized areas require further economic growth and expanded trade;
                            and (b) the less developed areas seek to develop and modernize their
                            economies and must also maintain a substantial volume of exports of
                            primary products. It should be within the capacity of the free world,
                            with U.S. initiative and leadership, to turn these two problems into
                            mutually supporting assets for the promotion of appropriate economic
                            strength and growth.</p>
                        <p>41. A necessary condition for such strength and growth is a high level of
                            international trade within the free world. In order to foster this, the
                            U.S. (a) should continue to press strongly for a general reduction of
                            trade barriers; (b) must take the lead by reducing further its own
                            tariff level over the next few years; and (c) should also support sound
                            moves to widen the convertibility of currencies.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_35" n="35" facs="0059"/>
                        <p>42. The dangers to free world stability are particularly acute in the
                            less developed areas. The task of speeding up their economic growth,
                            providing adequate dietary conditions, and promoting stability presents
                            a multitude of problems, political and social as well as economic. For
                            example, it calls for some changes in traditional habits and attitudes
                            and for greatly expanded training in administrative and technical
                            skills. In any case, new capital investment is a prerequisite to growth.
                            Local capital will have to be supplemented by the provision of capital
                            from abroad. In addition to external public and private investment and
                            IBRD loans, substantial financing from U.S. public funds (including the
                            Export-Import Bank) will be necessary, in some cases over an extended
                            period, to help achieve the economic progress essential to U.S.
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>43. In order to promote conditions of sound development in less developed
                            areas the United States should be prepared to use economic means
                            available to it where (a) such action serves U.S. objectives, (b) such
                            development cannot be financed by local or other foreign capital, and
                            (c) such assistance will be effectively used. The total level of U.S.
                            economic assistance worldwide should, however, be reduced as rapidly as
                            is consistent with U.S. security interests.</p>
                        <p>44. U.S. financial assistance alone cannot produce satisfactory economic
                            growth in less developed areas, and external assistance should be used
                            in a way to promote and not decrease local incentives and self-help. In
                            addition to the provision of financial assistance, the United States
                            should train indigenous leaders, develop skills, and provide competent
                            advisers. U.S. information, cultural, education and exchange programs
                            should also be strengthened.</p>
                        <p>45. U.S. political policies must be adapted to conditions prevailing in
                            each less developed area. The U.S. should not exert pressure to make
                            active allies of those not so included. The U.S. should provide
                            assistance on the basis of the willingness and ability of countries to
                            strengthen and defend their independence against Communist expansion
                            rather than on their formal alignment with the U.S. As far as possible,
                            the U.S. should attempt to work with rather than against those forces,
                            such as constructive nationalist and reform movements, which are likely
                            to remain powerful over a long period.</p>
                        <p>46. Where disputes and tensions between free nations threaten to impair
                            free world strength and cohesion, the U.S. should exert its best efforts
                            to help settle them or at least moderate their effects. In addition to
                            efforts to settle specific current controversies, the U.S. should
                            develop long-term policies to deal with deep-seated problems (such as
                            those involved in the evolution of colonial peoples).</p>

                            Bloc</p>
                        <p>47. The U.S. should develop a political strategy against the Communist
                            bloc designed (a) to reduce the likelihood of aggression, (b) to
                            influence, in ways favorable to U.S. and free world interests, decisions
                            and developments within the Communist bloc, such as toward greater
                            emphasis on internal problems, and (c) to foster long-run trends which
                            might lead to basic changes in the outlook or character of Communist
                            regimes.</p>
                        <p>48. In pursuing this strategy, the U.S. should seek (a) to convince the
                            Communist regimes that alternatives exist to their present policies
                            which would be acceptable to the U.S. and which they might come to
                            consider compatible with their basic security interests, (b) to give to
                            the Communist regimes a clear conception of the true U.S. and free world
                            purposes and uncompromising determination to resist Communist aggressive
                            moves, and (c) to exploit, in ways consistent with this strategy,
                            differences within the Soviet system or between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and other members of the Communist
                            bloc.</p>
                        <p>49. The U.S. should be ready to negotiate with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> whenever it clearly appears that U.S.
                            security interests will be served thereby.</p>
                        <p>50. In applying this strategy to Communist China, the U.S. must take
                            account of non-recognition of the regime and the regime’s recent and
                            continuing aggressive policies. However, the U.S. should be ready to
                            participate in talks including Communist China on specific subjects on
                            an ad hoc basis, where the general objectives mentioned in connection
                            with negotiations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would
                            be served thereby.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">IV. Domestic Strength</p>
                        <p>51. <hi rend="italic">Sound U.S. Economy</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>a. A strong, healthy and expanding U.S. economy is essential to the
                            security and stability of the free world. The level of expenditures for
                            national security programs must take into full account the danger to the
                            U.S. and its allies resulting from impairment, through inflation or the
                            undermining of incentives, of the basic soundness of the U.S. economy or
                            of the continuing expansion of the U.S. economy under a free enterprise
                            system.</p>
                        <p>b. The Federal Government should continue to make a determined effort to
                            bring its total annual expenditures and its total annual revenues into
                            balance, or into substantial balance; and should maintain overall credit
                            and fiscal policies designed to assist in stabilizing the economy.</p>
                        <p>c. Nevertheless, the U.S. must continue to meet the necessary costs of
                            the programs essential for its security.</p>
                        <p>d. All Federal expenditures, especially those not essential for the
                            national security, should be held to a necessary minimum. Every effort
                            should be made to eliminate waste, duplication, and unnecessary overhead
                            in the Federal Government.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_37" n="37" facs="0061"/>
                        <p>e. The United States should also seek (1) to maintain a higher and
                            expanding rate of economic activity at relatively stable price levels,
                            and (2) to maximize the economic potential of private enterprise by
                            minimizing governmental controls and regulations and by encouraging
                            private enterprise to develop natural and technological resources (e.g.,
                            nuclear power).</p>
                        <p>52. <hi rend="italic">Internal Security</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Internal security measures should be adequate to meet the threat to U.S.
                            security of covert attack by the Soviet bloc on the United States by
                            means of sabotage, subversion, espionage, and particularly the
                            clandestine introduction and detonation of nuclear weapons.</p>
                        <p>53. <hi rend="italic">Civil Defense</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>An essential ingredient of our domestic strength is an improved and
                            strengthened civil defense program which seeks to minimize damage from
                            nuclear attack by both preventive and ameliorative measures.</p>
                        <p>54. <hi rend="italic">Support by U.S. Citizens</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>a. No national strategy to meet the Soviet threat can be successful
                            without the support of the American people. During a time of increasing
                            Soviet atomic power, the determination of U.S. citizens to face the
                            risks involved in carrying out such national strategy will be of
                            increasing importance. Continuing efforts should be made to inform the
                            American people of the demands on their spiritual and material resources
                            necessary to ensure U.S. security during a period of armed truce, which
                            may either continue for many years or be broken by an atomic war.</p>
                        <p>b. Eternal vigilance is necessary in carrying out the national strategy,
                            to prevent the intimidation of free criticism. Necessary protective
                            measures should not be used to destroy national unity, which must be
                            based on freedom and not on fear.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>a. Essential to the strong security posture required by the national

                        <p>[Here follows discussion of unrelated subjects.]</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BS1">Bridges</persName> started off a discussion
                            when he asked the President how he would recommend the Senators handle
                            the <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName> testimony of
                                yesterday<note n="2" xml:id="d8fn2">Given at a January 31 hearing
                                before the House Armed Services Committee.</note> when <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName> said that the cuts in Army
                            personnel would jeopardize to a degree the security of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The President, in reply, launched into a long and exceedingly emphatic
                            discussion of this question which ran as follows:</p>
                        <p>“Gentlemen, <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName> is Chief of
                            Staff of the Army. When he is called up on the Hill and asked for
                            personal convictions, he has got to give them. Each Service has as its
                            head and has traditionally had as its head, people who think that their
                            service is the only service that can ultimately save the Unites States
                            in time of war. They all want additional manpower and they always will.
                            But we must realize that as Commander–in–Chief, I have to make the final
                            decisions. I have to look at this whole question of the military
                            establishment as one which must be kept in balance. I have to
                            consider—which the heads of the services do not—the very delicate
                            balance between the national debt, taxes and expenditures. I have to
                            decide what is necessary for adequate security. If I had all the money I
                            wanted right now, I wouldn’t use that money to keep 300,000 men in the
                            Army. I would use it for other purposes. Why, even from the question of
                            the defense of the United States I would much rather put that money into
                            new highways and roads so that we could get around this country in a
                            hurry in case of attack.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_40" n="40" facs="0064"/>
                        <p>“You see, actually, the only thing we fear is an atomic attack delivered
                            by air on our cities. Suppose that attack were to occur tomorrow on
                            fifteen of our cities. God damn it? It would be perfect rot to talk
                            about shipping troops abroad when fifteen of our cities were in ruins.
                            You would have disorder and almost complete chaos in the cities and in
                            the roads around them. You would have to restore order and who is going
                            to restore it? Do you think the police and fire departments of those
                            cities could restore order? Nuts! That order is going to have to be
                            restored by disciplined armed forces. It’s going to have to be restored
                            by our military forces and by our Reserve. That’s what our military is
                            going to be doing in the first days of an all-out atomic attack. They
                            are going to have to restore order and get our production going again.
                            Anyone who thinks we are going to immediately ship out of this country
                            division after division is just talking through his hat. It couldn’t be
                            done and if I tried to do it, you would want to impeach me. That’s the
                            trouble with <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName>. He’s
                            talking theory—I’m trying to talk sound sense. He did the same thing at
                                <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">shape</gloss>. I was there before
                                <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName> went over and he
                            tried to ruin it with the same sort of talk. We have to have a sound
                            base here at home. We have got to restore order and our productivity
                            before we do anything else. That’s why in our military thinking today we
                            have to put emphasis on two or three things first. One—we have to
                            maintain a strong striking retaliatory air force and secondly, we have
                            to build up our warning system so that we can receive as much advance
                            notice as possible of any attack.</p>
                        <p>“What do you people think would happen if this city were hit today by an
                            H-bomb? Do you think you would vote or ask me to send the troops at Fort
                            Meade overseas—or would you be knocking on my door to get me to bring
                            them in to try to pick up the pieces here in Washington? We have to do
                            that. All our military plans are based really on two main things—One, to
                            destroy the enemy’s production and two, protect your own. To do that we
                            need not just more men. We need more equipment, an expanded air force
                            and an expanded warning system.”</p>
                        <p>As the President was talking, you could hear a pin drop in the room. He
                            pounded the table quite a few times for emphasis, and everyone in the
                            room, I am sure, realized both the seriousness of the situation and the
                            President’s arguments.</p>

                                    White House meeting on March 27, 1954, that a study be made of
                                    U.S. technological capability to reduce the threat of surprise
                                    attack. The resulting panel, frequently referred to as the

                                    The committee set as its objective an examination of the current
                                    vulnerability of the United States to surprise attack and an
                                    investigation of how science and technology could be used to
                                    reduce that vulnerability by contributing to the following five
                                    developments: An increase in U.S. nuclear retaliatory power to
                                    deter or at least defeat a surprise attack; an increase in U.S.
                                    intelligence capabilities to enhance the ability to predict and
                                    give adequate warning of an intended surprise attack; a
                                    strengthening of U.S. defenses to deter or blunt a surprise
                                    attack; the achievement of a secure and reliable communications
                                    network; and an understanding of the effect of advanced
                                    technology on the manpower requirements of the armed forces.</p>

                            technology over the next decade or so.</p>
                        <p>This timetable reflects a careful evaluation of the present status and
                            future trend of military technology, particularly the technology of
                            air-atomic power. It also assumes the correctness of the current
                            national intelligence estimates of the corresponding Soviet air-atomic
                            power. It is obvious that a serious error in these estimates of Russian
                                <pb xml:id="pg_42" n="42" facs="0066"/>capabilities would destroy
                            the foundations on which this timetable is constructed. At present we
                            see no better alternative than to base our assumptions on these
                            estimates.</p>
                        <p>A framework of this kind, showing the changes possible in our position
                            relative to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, is of fundamental
                            importance in analyzing the problem of surprise, in planning our program
                            of military technology, and in the formulation of broad national policy
                            with respect to national security and to our relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The periods and possibilities
                            described below must be considered in our planning if we are to give
                            proper weight to the technological factors.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Period I—The Present Phase</p>
                        <p>Because of our air-atomic power we have an offensive advantage but are
                            vulnerable to surprise attack.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Characteristcs</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Because of the strength of <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> and our
                            large capability in atomic bombs, the striking power of U.S. is great
                            relative to <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. We do not yet have large multimegation capability.</p>
                        <p>3. No reliable U.S. early warning; our defense system is inadequate;
                            therefore <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> is vulnerable and U.S. is
                            open to surprise attack.</p>
                        <p>4. Evidence is accumulating that Soviets are developing their long-range
                            delivery capability.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Effects</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A. Neither the U.S. nor the Soviets can mount an air <hi rend="italic">strike</hi> against the other that would surely be decisive.<note n="2" xml:id="d9fn2">Decisive is defined as follows: (1) ability to
                                strike back essentially eliminated; or (2) civil, political, or
                                cultural life reduced to a condition of chaos; or both (1) and (2).
                                [Footnote in the source text.]</note> The U.S., however, could mount
                            a sustained air <hi rend="italic">offensive</hi> that would inflict
                            massive damage and would probably be conclusive in a general War.</p>
                        <p>B. Because of our vulnerability, Soviets might be tempted to try a
                            surprise attack. They might be so tempted in order to attack before we
                            achieve a large multimegaton capability.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Period II (Starting 1956/57—Ending 1958/60)</p>
                        <p>We will have a very great offensive advantage relative to <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and will be less vulnerable than
                            previously to surprise attack.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Characteristics</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. We will have achieved substantial numbers of multimegaton weapons in
                            addition to our large stockpile of atomic bombs. Soviets will not
                            have.</p>
                        <p>2. Some improvement in Russian delivery capability.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_43" n="43" facs="0067"/>
                        <p>3. Both Russia and the U.S. are achieving increased defense capability
                            but both continue vulnerable to surprise attack.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Effects</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A. Our deterrent power greatly increased; our military power relative to
                            that of Russia at its maximum. The U.S. can mount a decisive air strike;
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> cannot. In the event of
                            conflict the U.S. would be severely damaged, but would emerge a battered
                            victor even if the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> mounted a
                            surprise attack on the U.S.</p>
                        <p>B. Because the U.S. will have a substantial stockpile of multimegaton
                            weapons and the ability to deliver them on target, this is a period,
                            possibly of short duration, when the U.S. will possess great relative
                            military strength. Our military superiority may never be so great
                            again.</p>
                        <p>An intensive study should be undertaken to determine what diplomatic and
                            political policies will be most appropriate during Period II to turn it
                            to our best advantage and to the advantage of the free world. These
                            policies should recognize that any war which might occur would result in
                            severe damage to the U.S. despite our great relative strength.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Period III</p>
                        <p>This is a period of transition from Period II to Period IV involving the
                            occurrence in some order of the following characteristics:</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Characteristics</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. The development by the Soviets of a multimegaton capability. The
                            firing of a multimegaton weapon would be positive evidence that the
                            Soviets have begun to develop a capability with this weapon. The absence
                            of such an explosion is not positive assurance that they have not begun
                            to develop this capability. Although possible, the stockpiling of
                            multimegaton bombs would be improbable without a test firing. The
                            Russian test firing of August 1953 was not conclusive evidence of their
                            ability to make a modern multimegaton weapon.</p>
                        <p>2. The availability to the Soviets of a large number of high-performance
                            jet aircraft capable of reaching U.S. targets.</p>
                        <p>3. Substantial strengthening of U.S. defenses, including the achievement
                            of an effective continental defense system and the reduction of the
                            vulnerability of our strategic delivery systems.</p>
                        <p>4. Continued improvement in U.S. delivery capabilities, probably offset
                            to some extent by further improvement in Russian defense.</p>
                        <p>These four characteristics will occur somewhat gradually so that overlap
                            in time is almost inevitable.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_44" n="44" facs="0068"/>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Effects</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A. If our defenses against conventional attack are strengthened before
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has attained a multimegaton
                            capability and adequate delivery forces, the deterrent power of the U.S.
                            is increased. From the standpoint of military strength, this would
                            continue to be a phase favorable to the U.S.</p>
                        <p>B. Deterrent effect of U.S. power dangerously lessened if Soviet
                            production of multimegaton weapons and an adequate conventional delivery
                            capability is achieved prior to the development of an adequate U.S.
                            warning and defense system and before we have achieved a reduction of
                            the vulnerability of our strategic delivery systems. Under these
                            conditions, Soviet possession of such weapons and delivery capabilities
                            would place the U.S. in danger of surprise attack and possible
                            defeat.</p>
                        <p>This situation might develop as early as 1958. If we permit our military
                            position to worsen to this extent, we will be in a poor position to ward
                            off Russion political and diplomatic moves or to make such moves of our
                            own.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Period IV (Indefinite in length; possibly
                            beginning within a decade)</p>
                        <p>An attack by either side would result in mutual destruction.</p>
                        <p>This is the period when both the U.S. and Russia will be in a position
                            from which neither country can derive a winning advantage, because each
                            country will possess enough multimegaton weapons and adequate means of
                            delivering them, either by conventional or more sophisticated methods,
                            through the defenses then existing. The ability to achieve surprise will
                            not affect the outcome because each country will have the residual
                            offensive power to break through the defenses of the other country and
                            destroy it regardless of whether the other country strikes first.</p>
                        <p>The intercontinental ballistic missile can profoundly affect the military
                            posture of either country with respect to Period III and Period IV. If
                            the U.S. were to achieve an intercontinental ballistic missile
                            capability first, it could maintain that position of advantage,
                            described in III–A above, so long as the Soviets did not have this
                            missile capability. If the Russians achieve an intercontinental
                            ballistic missile capability first, they might gain a comparable
                            position of advantage.</p>
                        <p>Period IV is so fraught with danger to the U.S. that we should push all
                            promising technological development so that we may stay in Periods II
                            and III–A as long as possible, and, if we pass into Period IV, may
                            escape from it into another period resembling II or III–A.</p>
                        <p>It is recognized that Period IV would be a period of instability that
                            might easily be upset by either side and that a world catastrophe might
                            occur.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_45" n="45" facs="0069"/>
                        <p>Should we arrive at a condition where the contest is drawn and neither
                            contestant can derive military advantage (i.e., Period IV), we need not
                            assume that this state is unchangeable or that one country or the other
                            cannot move again into a position of relative advantage. We see no
                            certainty, however, that the condition of stalemate can be changed
                            through science and technology. This does not mean that some now
                            unimagined weapon or development, far afield from any present weapons
                            system, might not provide an advantage to one side or the other.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Implications of the Timetable</p>
                        <p>The periods of relative military strength which we have delineated
                            reflect our own appraisal of the technological, intelligence, and
                            military factors affecting our military position in relation to that of
                            Russia. While we originally had other objectives in constucting the
                            table it is apparent that it has implications for our diplomatic policy
                            and international negotiations. It seems clear, for example, that Period
                            II (also Period III–A) may be from the standpoint of relative military
                            strength a very favorable period for political moves and diplomatic
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>We emphasize that even though our <hi rend="italic">relative</hi>
                            military strength may change in the manner suggested in the table, we
                            still remain in a position where the United States can be grievously
                            hurt.</p>
                        <p>The timetable points up other urgencies in our program. We must press
                            forward in the United States to fill the gaps and correct the weaknesses
                            in our offense and defense. Our capacity to maintain a position of
                            advantage will depend upon our carrying through, thoroughly and without
                            delays, the remedies already available, authorized, or planned to
                            overcome present weaknesses.</p>
                        <p>We must also press forward to develop more sophisticated offenses and
                            defenses. We must constantly seek new technological breakthroughs that
                            will bring about significant advances in our military power. The
                            Russians will certainly do everything possible to achieve an advantage
                            by searching for big advances in their weapons technology.</p>
                        <p>In the succeeding parts of this report, we have sought to point out the
                            places where we need to carry through, to expedite, and to complete
                            currently accepted improvements in our weapons systems which will
                            provide new strength in both offense and defense. We have sought to
                            suggest the new decisions, undertakings, and developments which we
                            believe to be important to the continued buildup of our military
                            strength. We have tried to pick up those promising developments that
                            might be important new advances in technology and in <pb xml:id="pg_46" n="46" facs="0070"/>intelligence. All these things that we analyze,
                            report upon, and recommend are designed to keep us in a position of
                            advantage in terms of the timetable we have constructed.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">We recommend that:</p>
                        <p>1. After review by the President and the National Security Council of the
                            “Timetable of Change in Our Military Position Relative to Russia,”
                            consideration be given to the recommendation in this timetable that an
                            intensive study be undertaken to determine what diplomatic and political
                            policies will be most appropriate during Period II to turn it to our
                            best advantage and to the advantage of the free world. (See pages 10
                            through 13, Part I.)<note n="3" xml:id="d9fn3">These pages comprise Part
                                I, Section 4, printed above.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. The National Security Council formally recognize the present Air Force
                            program for the development of an intercontinental ballistic missile as
                            a nationally suported effort of highest priority.</p>
                        <p>3. Actions be taken to permit the present unacceptable ground
                            vulnerability of the Strategic Air Command to be reduced more rapidly.
                            We recommend, further, that the emergency measures, discussed on page 68
                            of Part III,<note n="4" xml:id="d9fn4">Not printed.</note> be carefully
                            examined by the National Security Council in relation to the immediacy
                            of the threat.</p>
                        <p>4. The National Security Council examine the specific recommendations we
                            have made for strengthening our continental defenses with a view to
                            incorporating them in an early revision of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5408.<note n="5" xml:id="d9fn5">For text, see <ref target="frus1952-54v02p1">

                        <p>5. The National Security Council examine the technical, procedural and
                            personal links by which early warnings are translated into responsive
                            national action. We recommend, further, that a mechanism be established
                            within the Executive Office of the President for promoting and
                            monitoring the planning and execution of readiness tests.</p>

                        <p>6. The National Security Council establish policies and take actions
                            which will permit the full exploitation of the intelligence and other
                            advantages which can be made available to us through the establishment
                            of stations on the polar pack ice, particularly on the Eurasian rim.</p>
                        <p>7. The National Security Council initiate preparatory studies of the
                            problems of international negotiation in the following areas growing out
                            of recommendations of this report.</p>

                        <p>8. A re-examination be made of U.S.-Canadian continental defense
                            relationships with a view toward bringing about still more effective
                            cooperation between the two countries.</p>
                        <p>9. A re-examination be made of the following principles or practices of
                            international law from the standpoint of recent advances in weapons
                            technology:</p>

                            nuclear missiles.</p>
                        <p>b. <hi rend="italic">[remainder of paragraph (4½ lines of source text)

                        </p>
                        <p>10. An agency be established, or designated, having responsibility for
                            investigating the reliability of the overseas communications networks,
                            and for planning and promoting technical and other improvements needed
                            to achieve a considerable reduction in the vulnerability of our overseas
                            communications.</p>
                        <p>We recommend, further, that a communications office be established, or
                            designated, having responsibility for the continuous collection and
                            evaluation of information on the current performance of all vital links
                            of the overseas communications networks; and that this, or a related
                            office, have responsibility for coordinating the rapid interchange and
                            rerouting of traffic in the event of widespread interference with our
                            communications.</p>
                        <p>11. A study group be appointed to undertake an exhaustive examination of
                            the techniques and the weapons technology for peripheral wars. Such a
                            technical study might be but a part of a more comprehensive examination
                            of the peripheral war problem.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_48" n="48" facs="0072"/>
                        <p>12. A study, as a follow-up to this present report, be sponsored by the
                            Executive Office of the President within two years. The technology of
                            national defense is dynamic in nature and requires continual review and
                            evaluation to take into account international and political, as well as
                            technological change.</p>
                        <p rend="center">2. Specific Recommendations</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A For Still Further Strengthening Our Striking
                            Power, we recommend that:</p>
                        <p>1. The development of an intercontinental ballistic missile (with about
                            5500 nautical mile range and megaton warhead) continue to receive the
                            very substantial support necessary to complete it at the earliest
                            possible date.</p>
                        <p>2. There be developed a ballistic missile (with about 1500 nautical mile
                            range and megaton warhead) for strategic bombardment; both land-basing
                            and ship-basing should be considered.</p>
                        <p>3. The program for the development of high energy aircraft fuels, and
                            propulsion systems capable of using them, be approved and receive strong
                            support.</p>
                        <p>4. Supplies of high energy aircraft fuels adequate for development and
                            testing of engines and equipment be manufactured and made available at
                            an early date.</p>
                        <p>5. The program directed toward development of aircraft nuclear propulsion
                            systems continue to receive strong support and that the program include
                            a propulsion system for bombers.</p>
                        <p>6. The Strategic Air Command be provided additional bases in numbers
                            sufficient to permit its bombers to be airborne towards target within
                            the warning interval, as well as to limit to a reasonable number the
                            bombers at risk at each base.</p>
                        <p>7. The new significance of the striking power of small aircraft, which
                            would come with the availability of lightweight megaton bombs in
                            quantity, be taken into account in future planning.</p>
                        <p>8. The Department of Defense conduct further studies and experimentation
                            to determine the feasibility of a seaplane nuclear bomber force.</p>
                        <p>9. As a first step in comparing the capabilities and vulnerabilities of
                            the United States and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in a
                            possible nuclear air war, a comprehensive comparison of U.S. and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> Bravo, Romeo, and Delta target
                            systems be undertaken in the context of a single symmetric study, using
                            common terms of reference and a common framework of analysis.</p>
                        <p>10. For planning purposes, the maximum yield per weight of nuclear
                            weapons be taken as [<hi rend="italic">7 words not
                            declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_49" n="49" facs="0073"/>
                        <p>11. For U.S. defense planning purposes, it be considered technically
                            feasible for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to deliver, by
                            ship or by submarine, very large and heavy, though expensive, bombs
                            having yields up to about [<hi rend="italic">2 words not
                                declassified</hi>],</p>
                        <p>12. For U.S. defenses planning purposes, it should be considered
                            technically feasible for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to
                            construct, for clandestine introduction into the United States, nuclear
                            bombs having yields as high as megatons.</p>
                        <p>13. Current studies directed toward better understanding of the
                            radiological hazards that may result from the detonation of large
                            numbers of nuclear weapons be continued.</p>
                        <p>14. Plans for the military use of nuclear bombs should not at this time
                            be restrained because of the long-term radiological hazard.</p>

                            seaward portions, and urge its installation without delaying for
                            technical or geographic refinements. We recommend early installation of
                            the proposed extension of the North Canada Line to Greenland and
                            shifting to the northern terminus of the Atlantic extension from
                            Newfoundland to Greenland, in accordance with the suggestion of <gloss target="#t_CONAD1">CONAD</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. We endorse the planned additions of long-range radars and gap-filler

                            including extensions of contiguous radar coverage to seaward (Atlantic

                        <p>3. We recommend that nuclear warheads be adopted as the major armament
                            for our air defense forces and that this step be implemented by:</p>
                        <p>a. Expeditious development, procurement, and deployment of sufficient
                            weapons to provide a high kill capability at an early date.</p>
                        <p>b. Commencement of negotiations with Canada to provide defense forces
                            with authority for instant use of atomic warheads wherever needed over
                            Canada.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_50" n="50" facs="0074"/>
                        <p>c. Use of the high-altitude shot at the next atomic test series as a
                            springboard for a public information program with the dual objective of
                            allaying possible civilian fears and informing our enemies and allies
                            that we are using our atomic capabilities for defensive purposes.</p>
                        <p>4. We recommend an intensified effort to create effective defenses at low
                            and very high altitudes, and a broadened attack on the basic technical
                            problems involved. Important elements of this program are (specific
                            recommendations are given in Part IV, Sections 3 and 5):<note n="8" xml:id="d9fn8">Not printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>a. Interim rules, pending completion of the warning and continental radar
                            nets, to keep Nike batteries in alert status and free to fire on
                            aircraft above a predetermined altitude.</p>
                        <p>b. Firm planning for the evolution of a radar net to match the needs and
                            capabilities of the <gloss target="#t_SAGE1">SAGE</gloss> system.</p>
                        <p>c. Further development of air-to-air and ground-to-air nuclear
                            weapons.</p>

                        <p>i. A greatly enlarged program of field and operational trials and
                            experiments to support the developments and investigations
                            recommended.</p>
                        <p>5. We recommend that defenses against attack from or over the sea be—in
                            plan, organization, and operation—an integral and coordinate part of the
                            over-all continental defenses; this can be achieved only if the
                            responsibilities, missions, and means now under the authorities of
                                <gloss target="#t_CONAD1">CONAD</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CINCLANT1">CinCLant</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CinCPac</gloss> are coordinated for joint

                        <p>6. We recommend that programs for submarine detection and surveillance
                            systems be advanced and modified as follows:</p>
                        <p>a. <hi rend="italic">[remainder of paragraph (2½ lines of source text)

                        </p>
                        <p>7. We recommend that a positive program to invigorate our non-military
                            defenses be instituted by:</p>
                        <p>a. Immediate initiation by the Federal Civil Defense Administration of a
                            study of the casualties expected from typical thermonuclear attacks
                            under various conditions of evacuation and shelter. This study, which
                            should be made by a group with access to all necessary classified <pb xml:id="pg_51" n="51" facs="0075"/>data, should point out at an
                            early date the factors influencing the proper balance between shelters
                            and evacuation and provide data for individual community planning.</p>
                        <p>b. Prompt formulation of a new national civil defense policy designed to
                            cope with the new threat from thermonuclear weapons and radioactive
                            fall-out from surface bursts.</p>
                        <p>c. Clear statements of this policy by the President and other high
                            government officials, informing the public of the nature of the threat,
                            the anticipated effects of thermonuclear weapons and the defense
                            measures designed to give all individuals maximum opportunity for
                            survival. These statements should provide the leadership required to</p>
                        <p>five public assurance that, when this policy is implemented, megaton bomb
                            attacks will not produe national collapse.</p>
                        <p>d. Re-examination and re-statement of the proper relationships that must
                            exist between civil and military authorities in order to cope with the
                            disaster conditions that may follow a large-scale attack.</p>
                        <p>e. Providing the Federal Civil Defense Administration with authority and
                            the necessary funds to carry out an orderly and continuous research and
                            development program designed to solve its own particular problems.</p>
                        <p>f. Further attention to measures to reduce the vulnerability of our
                            essential civilian-supporting industries, in addition to those measures
                            now directed toward the dispersion of direct war-supporting
                            industries.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>8. We recommend further development of the warning and surveillance
                            system by:</p>
                        <p>a. Early installation of a radar line 500 to 700 miles from our
                            continental boundaries to provide the required unmistakeable signal of
                            an actual attack and to provide tracking information on which to base
                            deployment of defensive forces. The planned mid-Canada line would
                            furnish the northern element of this line.</p>
                        <p>b. Extension of the Distant Early Warning Line from Greenland via Iceland
                            and the Faroes to join the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> warning
                            system (virtually non-existent at present) at some point recommended by
                                <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">shape</gloss>. Long-range, land-based
                            radars should be used wherever possible. They should be installed as
                            soon as feasible, regardless of when other components can become
                            operational. By themselves they could give satisfactory cover, except at
                            low altitudes midway between stations.</p>
                        <p>c. Consideration of ultimate replacement of the Alaska–Hawaii line by a
                            system of fixed radars along the Aleutians plus an overwater line to
                            Midway. Such a system would increase initial warning and reduce the
                            overwater link.</p>
                        <p>d. Determination of the effectiveness of Airborne Early Warning planes in
                            trailing unknown aircraft crossing the Distant Early Warning Line, as a
                            step toward developing a distant surveillance capability.</p>
                        <p>e. Experimentation with fixed radars and listening devices and with
                            irregular Airborne Early Warning patrol planes in important areas near
                            the enemy’s perimeter, particularly in the neighborhood of his forward
                            launching bases. Should they prove effective, consideration <pb xml:id="pg_52" n="52" facs="0076"/>should be given to their
                            permanent adoption in appropriate areas (e.g., in refueling areas)—for
                            intelligence purposes, to give possible early alert of potential attack,
                            and to harass the enemy.</p>
                        <p>9. To exploit the full potentialities of defense in depth, to protect our
                            peripheral cities, and to minimize the danger from large bombs anywhere
                            within our borders, we recommend continuing outward extension of the
                            combat zone, by:</p>
                        <p>a. Providing a zone of radar surveillance for about 300 miles beyond the
                            programmed extensions of contiguous radar coverage over the Atlantic and
                            Pacific; this need would be met by the zonal coverage provided by the
                            radar line of recommendation 8a.</p>
                        <p>b. Extending prime radar coverage northward to approximately the
                            mid-Canada line and low-altitude coverage (gap fillers) to a distance
                            well beyond the heavily populated regions of Canada; taking steps to
                            enable our interceptors to supplement the Canadan defense forces in this
                            region (i.e., by obtaining the necessary agreements and bases).</p>
                        <p>c. Exploiting future improvements in interceptor ranges by corresponding
                            extensions to seaward of the full weapons control capability, and of the
                            surveillance-only zone beyond. [<hi rend="italic">Note:</hi> Extension
                            of the Atlantic zone may ultimately justify elimination of the
                            Greenland–Azores warning line (recommendation 1), provided the
                            Greenland–Iceland–Europe line (recommendation 8b) has been
                                installed.]<note n="9" xml:id="d9fn9">Brackets in the source
                                text.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>d. Immediate development and installation of effective data processing
                            and transmitting equipment and procedures to integrate overwater
                            surveillance information into a system linked with the land-based
                            “ground environment.”</p>
                        <p>10. Drastic revision of the function and traditional form of the
                            interceptor aircraft to conduct effective combat at very high altitudes.
                            We believe that the burden of speed and maneuverability in combat must
                            be shifted to the air-to-air missile, and that the interceptor must
                            become a launching platform having adequate radar and the range and
                            mobility needed to marshal forces against a concentrated attack. We
                            recommend a broad program of study and development to understand and
                            exploit the potential of guided missiles in air-to-air combat.</p>
                        <p>11. In order further to improve our sea defenses, we recommend</p>
                        <p>that:</p>
                        <p>a. <hi rend="italic">[remainder of paragraph (3 lines of source text) not
                                declassified]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>b. <hi rend="italic">[remainder of paragraph (6 lines of source text) not
                                declassified]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>12. We recommend that comprehensive programs be instituted to provide
                            effective control of surface and, insofar as possible, subsurface
                            traffic in both oceans from the coast lines to beyond the likely
                            striking range of sea-launched attacks. For proper implementation:</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_53" n="53" facs="0077"/>
                        <p>a. International arrangements should be made for the establishment of
                            information reporting procedures and of control measures.</p>
                        <p>b. Studies should be made of appropriate changes in the concept of the
                            “three-mile limit” to permit actions in keeping with the threat; for
                            realistic implementation of any policy changes, the missions of the
                            Coast Guard and Navy must be amended and forces increased to equal the
                            tasks of inspection and control.</p>
                        <p>c. Sea traffic plots should be established utilizing modern techniques
                            for correlating, analyzing, storing and displaying traffic information
                            gathered from both military and civilian sources. Traffic patterns as
                            well as individual ship movements should be care fully watched.</p>
                        <p>d. Maximum utilization should be made of the surface surveillance
                            capability of the seaward components of the air defense radar
                            system.</p>
                        <p>e. The feasibility of shore-based low-frequency radar for long-range
                            detection and tracking of surface traffic should be vigorously explored
                            and, if warranted, systems should be installed.</p>
                        <p>13. Although the technical problems that must be solved in attaining a
                            defense against intercontinental ballistic missiles are extremely
                            complex, there are sufficiently promising leads to justify an expanded
                            and accelerated research effort on a broad front. Accordingly, we
                            recommend that there be established a strong, balanced program of
                            theoretical and experimental investigations of the basic problems of
                            detection, interception and destruction. We suggest that the newly
                            established Special Panel of the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board
                            give early consideration to the formation of a full-time technical group
                            to carry out a rapid but thorough examination of the entire problem,
                            with the objective of laying the framework for the expanded program.</p>
                        <p>14. One important element of defense against <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> attack— warning in minutes—is attainable. We recommend
                            the immediate initiation of component development, engineering design
                            and planning for the installation of a radar detection system to provide
                            the maximum practicable amount of warning on the approach of ballistic
                            missiles to the United States from likely launching areas.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. For Improvement and Better Use of Our
                            Intelligence</p>
                        <p>1. Because we are unable to conclude that the United States surely will,
                            or surely will not, have useful strategic warning in the event of a
                            surprise attack, we recommend that our planning take serious account of
                            both possibilities.</p>
                        <p>2. The fact that the probability of strategic warning increases with the
                            size of the attack gives added support to the recommendations that our
                            striking forces be further dispersed and that our defenses be
                            strengthened.</p>

                        <p>3. We <hi rend="italic">must</hi> find ways to increase the number of
                            hard facts upon which our intelligence estimates are based, to provide
                            better strategic warning, to minimize surprise in the kind of attack,
                            and to reduce the danger of gross overestimation or gross
                            underestimation of the threat. To this end, we recommend adoption of a
                            vigorous program for the extensive use, in many intelligence procedures,
                            of the most advanced knowledge in science and technology.</p>

                        <p>Overseas communications systems less vulnerable to jamming and sabotage
                            are urgently needed. Without them, messages containing strategic-warning

                            We recommend the following technical improvements in communications

                            military circuits.</p>
                        <p>5. Tests and other work on the NOMAC system be carried on with highest
                            priority.</p>
                        <p>6. Further studies of feasibility and usefulness be made of high-speed
                            (Squirt) transmission.</p>
                        <p>7. Further study be made of multifrequency switching to determine whether
                            such military equipment should be developed.</p>
                        <p>8. In the design of future equipment, consideration be given to possible
                            use of facsimile in the case of jamming.</p>
                        <p>9. The services be prepared to use <gloss target="#t_CW1">CW</gloss>
                            (hand code) operations in cases where experienced operators can be
                            provided.</p>
                        <p>10. Operational tests be made of the communications zone indicator (COZI)
                            system under jamming conditions and, if results prove favorable, that
                            the equipment be added to the communications system.</p>
                        <p>11. Jamming tests be made at reasonable intervals under conditions that
                            will tax to the limit the ability of those charged with operating the
                            facilities to use evasive techniques, alternate routings, and their
                            operational understanding.</p>
                        <p>12. Extensive studies and tests be made immediately to determine the
                            jamming characteristics of forward-scatter transmissions and that where
                            it appears effective the services be encouraged to install such systems
                            where geographic conditions permit.</p>

                        <p>13. Further work on the development of the Janet equipment for
                            meteor-trail transmissions be encouraged.</p>
                        <p>14. Further study and evaluation of the artificial satellite transmission
                            system be made.</p>
                        <p>15. The merits of Voice of America point-to-point circuits be studied in
                            detail and, if the results look promising, immediate steps be taken for
                            the implementation of a conversion program.</p>
                        <p>16. The problem of cable vulnerability be given thorough study in the
                            light of the present political situation and modern technology for
                            mining and cable cutting.</p>
                        <p>17. Efforts be made to bring to a conclusion present studies to
                            determine:</p>
                        <p>a. If an old cable between San Francisco and Guam is worth acquiring and
                            rehabilitating.</p>
                        <p>b. Whether a completely new broad-band cable in the Pacific area should
                            be planned.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">E. For Better Maintenance of Equipment, we
                            recommend that:</p>
                        <p>1. A professional “hard core” military maintenance force for each service
                            be developed of sufficient stability to satisfy future military needs
                            for maintenance personnel.</p>
                        <p>2. Careful and continuing study be given to the effects of the recently
                            enacted re-enlistment bonus, and, if enacted, of the proposals contained
                            in the President’s recent message to Congress to determine whether
                            stonger incentives are required to correct the precarious lack of highly
                            trained maintenance personnel.</p>
                        <p>3. Greater efforts be made to develop a career motivation for skilled
                            maintenance personnel by providing an organizational environment that
                            recognizes the skill attainments of such personnel and that permits a
                            greater range of promotional opportunities.</p>
                        <p>4. More attention and emphasis be given to long-range personnel planning
                            in the highly skilled technical manpower areas, and to the impact that
                            planned new weapons systems will have on future requirements for
                            technical maintenance personnel.</p>
                        <p>5. The specific use of industrial contractors for the maintenance of
                            weapons systems in the ZI and overseas be given more extensive study by
                            the Department of Defense. This requires investigation of the kinds of
                            military operations that can be served through industrial maintenance
                            contracts and of ways in which civilian maintenance can be adapted to
                            the military system, particularly under conditions of emergency.</p>
                        <p>6. Consideration be given by each service to the organization of a select
                            corps of maintenance personnel willing to serve extensive periods of
                            time in the Arctic area, in anticipation of expanded military operations
                            in that area.</p>

                            keeping with the recommendation of the Net Capabilities Evaluation
                            Subcommittee that a permanent procedure be established to ensure a

                        <p>According to the directive in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5511,
                            the Net Evaluation Subcommittee was to provide “integrated evaluations

                            the event of general war, to inflict direct injury upon the continental

                            watch for changes which would significantly alter those net
                            capabilities.” These evaluations were to be submitted to the Council by
                            October 1 of each year and were to “Relate to the situation on a
                            critical date normally about three years in the future.” In addition to
                            these annual reports, the subcommittee was to submit a new evaluation
                            whenever it felt that a change had become apparent “that would
                            significantly alter the net capabilities of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.”</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">National Security</hi>—In discussion of the opposition
                            to the Administration’s plan for reducing force levels of the services,
                            the President remarked on the irony of having spent a good part of his
                            life fighting for an increase in the strength of the Army from 118,000
                            to 121,000, and then getting to the time when an Army of a million men
                            backed by large reserve forces would be regarded as too small.</p>
                        <p>The President said there comes a limit to how much defense we can buy,
                            and then morale and spirit and such things become of top importance. He
                            noted how some say we should have more divisions on hand because many of
                            the divisions of some of our allies aren’t as effective as they should
                            be. But if a great Russian land attack occurs, <pb xml:id="pg_58" n="58" facs="0082"/>he pointed out, it would do no good to ship divisions;
                            by the time these divisions could be getting into full action, the
                            damage would be done.</p>
                        <p>The President said that if you graph the curves of various elements and
                            their strength and effectiveness at particular times, you can see how
                            you must concentrate on the curves that are most practical. If, for
                            instance, Cleveland were bombed, forces at Camp Hood could not do much
                            good when there would be such chaos in the transportation system. But,
                            he thought, it would be useful to have a good “home guard.”</p>

                        <p>The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (Public Law 83–703, enacted August 30,
                            1954; 68 Stat. 919) empowered the President to authorize the Department
                            of Defense, with the assistance of the Atomic Energy Commission, to
                            cooperate with a regional defense organization to which the United
                            States was a party. It further authorized the Defense Department and

                            cooperation, however, was only to be undertaken in the context of an

                            and was submitted to the North Atlantic Council for negotiation. On

                        <p>In a series of conversations on March 6 and 7, the President and the
                            Secretary of State discussed the importance of educating the public on
                            the distinction between “atomic missiles for tactical purposes and the
                            big bomb with huge radioactive fall-outs.” According to Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, “the President felt
                            strongly that we must get acceptance of the use of atomic weapons as
                            ‘conventional’” and thought that a reference to atomic missiles might
                            usefully be inserted “in an incidental way” in the Secretary’s
                            forthcoming report to the nation on his 2-week <pb xml:id="pg_61" n="61" facs="0085"/>trip to Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific to
                            indicate that these tactical weapons, as opposed to weapons of mass
                            destruction, would be used interchangeably with conventional weaponry.
                                (<persName>Dulles</persName>’ memoranda of conversation are in the

                        <p>Accordingly, in his radio and television address on March 8, the
                            Secretary, in the course of his discussion of allied defense power in
                            the Far East, stated that “the United States in particular has sea and
                            air forces now equipped with new and powerful weapons of precision which
                            can utterly destroy military targets without endangering unrelated
                            civilian centers.” (Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>,
                            March 21, 1955, pages 459–464)</p>
                        <p>In response to a question at his news conference on March 15, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> elaborated on this
                            statement. According to press acounts of the conference (a complete
                            transcript has not been found in Department of State files), the
                            Secretary expounded a policy of “lessthan-massive retaliation” by the
                            United States anywhere in the world based on the use of small nuclear
                            weapons against military targets rather than full-scale, city-destroying
                            hydrogen bombs. According to the Secretary, the likelihood that weapons
                            of mass destruction would be used would decrease with the increased
                            availability of tactical nuclear weapons. <persName>Dulles</persName>
                            went on to say that unlike the situation in World War II, these new
                            weapons offered a chance for battlefield victory without harming
                            civilians and he indicated that in the event of a major assault against
                            Formosa, the United States might well intervene with forces so equipped.

                            statement and that “he [<persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName>]
                            was all for it,” telling <persName corresp="#p_HJC1">Hagerty</persName>
                            that “we wanted to show our enemies that we now deal with <gloss target="#t_A1">A</gloss>-bombs as conventional weapons.” (Eisenhower

                        <p>At his news conference that day, President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> said he could see no reason why, in a combat
                            situation where they could be used on strictly military targets,
                            tactical nuclear weapons should not be used “just exactly as you would
                            use a bullet or anything else. I believe that the great question about
                            these things comes when you begin to get into those areas where you
                            cannot make sure that you are operating merely against military targets.
                            But with that one qualification, I would say, yes, of course they would
                            be used.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the

                        <p>On December 14, the Planning Coordination Group met and approved a report
                            stating that, after 7 months’ experience, it was clear to the four
                            constituent members that the <gloss target="#t_PCG1">PCG</gloss>
                            mechanism would not be able to accomplish its assigned objectives and
                            they were therefore recommending that the President abolish the <gloss target="#t_PCG1">PCG</gloss> effective December 31. On December 20,
                            the President approved this recommendation.</p>

                        <p>At the regular <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting, which began
                            at 9:45 a.m. and which was held in the Broadcast Room of The White
                            House, Dr.<persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> made the
                            following introductory remarks: He recalled that the Science Advisory
                            Committee of <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> met in the President’s
                            office some months ago, at which time the President mentioned
                            technological aspects of our defense program which he desired to be
                            further explored. As a result, a highly competent panel of the Science
                            Advisory Committee was established under Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName>. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> said the panel had undertaken
                            its task enthusiastically; that over forty key scientists participated
                            in the work of the panel, with a considerable amount of sacrifice and
                            effort on their part. He expressed appreciation to the members of the
                            panel, and particularly to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName>, for giving unstintingly of both time and
                            effort. He then introduced Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> advised that the work
                            of his panel had not been fruitless. He commented on the cooperation and
                            support received from every agency, stating it was generous and
                            complete. He mentioned the high quality of most of the personnel in the
                            several agencies who deal <pb xml:id="pg_64" n="64" facs="0088"/>with
                            problems involving the subject of his report. He mentioned that his
                            panel submitted its report in a desire to be helpful; that the panel did
                            not express superior judgment in any sense; and that the panel was
                            acutely aware of the many practical difficulties in the way of
                            fulfilling some of the recommendations in the report. He said his panel
                            had sought to assist, to the extent of its abilities, by recommending
                            the best conceivable defense. He noted that he and his associates in
                            this work had the responsibility of preserving the amenities and the
                            confidential character of the relationship which they had enjoyed as
                            regards highly classified areas of Governmental business by virtue of
                            their work on the panel.</p>
                        <p>The following individuals then briefed the Council on the highlights of
                            the report, covering the Preface and pages 3 through 33 of the report:
                            Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_FJB1">Fisk</persName>, DuBridge, <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> and Land.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of this briefing, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> advised the Council that there had been
                            circulated, prior to the meeting, a draft Council action on the
                            recommendations of the report. He summarized its content and indicated
                            that the Departments concerned would have an opportunity to study it
                            further before final action was taken thereon.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Smith, Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Air, noted that in his
                            portion of the briefing Dr. DuBridge spoke in terms of <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> being based ultimately in the United
                            States. Mr. Smith asked if such a policy would be consistent with what
                            we are doing now. Dr. DuBridge replied in the affirmative, stating that
                            we do not recommend replacing, displacing, or obliterating our present
                            foreign bases. Dr. DuBridge said that, looking to the future, this
                            recommendation regarding <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> was aimed
                            at the time when the United States would have a better long-range
                            intercontinental bombing force which for security purposes would be
                            based in the United States without adversely affecting the
                            accomplishment of its operational objectives. Mr. Smith then inquired
                            why the briefing did not emphasize the refueling problem, and Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> replied that
                            refueling was covered in detail in the body of the report.</p>
                        <p>The President referred to that portion of the briefing which indicated
                            that the United States was approaching attainment of maximum yields from
                            nuclear weapons, whereas the Russians were not. He then made reference
                            to the proposal which has been made that the United States declare a
                            moratorium on the testing of nuclear weapons of certain sizes or yields,
                            and queried whether it wouldn’t be a good idea to endorse such a
                            moratorium proposal, particularly since we were so far ahead of the
                            Russians in this area. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FJB1">Fisk</persName>
                            replied that a moratorium which would restrict nuclear tests on the part
                            of the United States wouldn’t be a good idea in terms of what the United
                            States still needs to do. He said he was speaking not in terms of
                            achieving greater explosive yields, but rather in terms of tests which
                            would enable the <pb xml:id="pg_65" n="65" facs="0089"/>United States to
                            tailor nuclear weapons to a variety of military needs. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FJB1">Fisk</persName> added that we could not be assured
                            that the Russians have not tailored their atomic weapons to their
                            military needs. The President asked whether it would be practical for
                            the United States, in a moratorium-type approach to the problem, to cut
                            off at 100 k.t. on the grounds that if the Russians detonated nuclear
                            devices of greater yields we would be able to discover that fact and
                            turn it against them psychologically.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Holloway stated that if the United States restricted its nuclear
                            tests, this wouldn’t give us any guarantee that the Russians would
                            restrict theirs. The President questioned whether the Soviets might
                            stockpile thermonuclear bombs based on intelligence obtained about our
                            bomb tests without an actual Soviet full-scale test. Mr. Holloway
                            expressed his firm belief that such a step would require an exceptional
                            amount of courage on the part of the Soviet scientists to be sure their
                            designs would actually work.</p>
                        <p>At this point, the President spoke in terms of having a continuing panel
                            (with the scientists well represented) which could perform a very
                            helpful advisory role on the kind of information that could be given to
                            the public with respect to this general subject. He said that he did not
                            believe there was any agency in Government which was looking at this
                            problem from this standpoint on a continuing basis, and he said he
                            thought that the scientists could effectively cooperate with the
                            Government in this area.</p>
                        <p>Turning to another aspect of the subject, the President inquired of Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> whether his panel
                            found an unsatisfactory situation in respect to the present disposition
                            of atomic weapons, which arrangement he had approved for the military.
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> replied that he and
                            one other member of the panel had been primarily responsible for looking
                            into this aspect of the subject; that they had done so; and that they
                            had found the present arrangements for the deployment of atomic weapons
                            to be first-rate.</p>
                        <p>The President concluded the discussion with pertinent comments concerning
                            several aspects of the general subject, and he expressed his deep
                            appreciation to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName>,
                            members of the <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName>
                            Committee, and other scientists who had given much of their time and
                            efforts to the study on which the Council was briefed today by the
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> Committee.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> briefed the Council and
                            read the three different categories of Soviet actions with which the
                            paper was concerned.<note n="5" xml:id="d18fn5">Reference is to
                                paragraphs of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5515/1.</note>
                            With respect to Category II, which dealt with specific Soviet actions
                            which should be judged as a clear warning that Soviet attack on the
                            continental U.S. was probably imminent, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> pointed to subparagraph i, listing “Soviet action
                            to assassinate or to attempt to assassinate key U.S. civil and military
                            authorities”. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> indicated
                            his own view (with a smile) that a Soviet attempt to assassinate
                            President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> should be
                            placed in Catetegory I, as indicating that Soviet attack was not merely
                            probably imminent but certain or imminent. The Planning Board, however,
                            had disagreed. The President laughed, and said that the Planning Board
                            was undoubtedly right, and the attempt to assassinate him might merely
                            be based on personal dislike.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then indicated the view
                            of the Planning Board that the present report should be handled with
                            very great caution and that the Council might well confine itself to
                            merely noting the report. The President agreed, and stated that the
                            paper had largely served its purpose after it had been presented to
                            himself. He had simply wanted to know what the members of the various
                            staffs felt about possible hostile Soviet actions, and he thought that
                            the paper had been useful. He was sorry that it had taken so much time
                            and trouble to prepare.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that he had
                            only one suggestion to make regarding this report. Would it not be
                            useful to turn the picture around and examine what actions the United
                            States was taking or might take which the Soviet Union could judge to be
                            indications of the likelihood of a U.S. attack on the Soviet Union?</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> said that he
                            wished to make a comment about the third category of Soviet
                            actions—namely, actions which should be judged not as indictions that
                            attack was imminent or probably imminent, but as a possible prelude to
                            Soviet attack or as creating a serious international situation which,
                            through action and counteraction, might eventually lead to Soviet attack
                            on the continental United States. Would it not be wise, inquired
                            Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>, to study how
                            the <pb xml:id="pg_70" n="70" facs="0094"/>United States can get itself
                            in a position to counter such threatening Soviet actions without
                            actually setting in motion the chain of action and reaction which might
                            lead to war?</p>
                        <p>The President merely commented that this would be a good trick if you
                            could pull it off.</p>

                            includes action ranging from lesser measures (such as mobilization,
                            redisposition of U.S. forces, a possible warning to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> accompanied by a limited
                            demonstration of force, etc.) all the way to actual hostilities. The
                            study is limited to consideration of the Soviet actions which might be
                            taken; it does not identify the sources or methods by which intelligence
                            or information of such actions might be derived, or identify the precise
                            nature of the military actions (war plans) which might be taken. While
                            refraining from dealing with the nature of U.S. counteraction, the study
                            nevertheless does not imply that the U.S. response should necessarily be
                            uniform in nature. The U.S. response would have to be adapted to the
                            danger to the U.S. inherent in each instance, and might include actions
                            other than military measures.</p>
                        <p>3. Possible Soviet actions have been examined in terms of their bearing
                            on the imminence and probability of an attack on the U.S. by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The possibility can not be excluded
                            that certain actions, obviously acts of war, might be undertaken by the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> without warning, such as a
                            declaration of war on the U.S., a Soviet military attack on the
                            continental U.S., or the detonation of a nuclear weapon in the U.S.
                            However, such acts are outside the scope of this study, the purpose of
                            which is to identify and anticipate Soviet actions preliminary to an
                            attack.</p>
                        <p>4. Possible Soviet actions preliminary to an attack upon the continental
                            U.S. are listed in the next section of this study under three categories
                            according to the degree of certainty or imminence of such an attack.</p>
                        <p>5. There is no hard and fast dividing line between the categories of
                            possible Soviet actions. It is probable that Soviet actions enumerated
                            in category I would not occur in isolation from those listed in
                            categories II or III. The impression of simplicity and precision given
                            by the lists which follow should not be allowed to disguise the fact
                            that a difficult and complex value judgment would be involved in
                            determining the exact significance of certain of these actions within
                            the context of the general situation existing at the time of their
                            occurrence.</p>
                        <p>6. This study can be considered valid only in terms of the current world
                            situation and of Soviet capabilities as set forth in current National
                            Intelligence Estimates. As the world situation and Soviet capabilities
                            develop in the future, the significance of certain of the Soviet actions
                            considered herein will doubtless change. Therefore, this study cannot be
                            viewed either as a long-range or all-inclusive guide.</p>

                        <p>7. It is assumed that firm and conclusive evidence that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had decided to undertake any of the
                            actions listed below would be equivalent to the occurrence of the act
                            itself. The order of listing in any category is not necessarily an
                            indication of priority. Moreover, it should be noted that nothing in
                            this study affects the mission of the Watch Committee of the <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss>, which is “To provide earliest possible
                            warning to the United States Government of hostile action by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, or its Allies, which endangers the
                            security of the United States.”</p>

                        <p>8. Although as previously mentioned the possibility of total surprise
                            cannot be excluded, it is considered that Soviet actions immediately
                            threatening the safety of the continental U.S. would probably occur
                            against a background of increased international tension and a drastic
                            change toward an offensive posture by Soviet military forces.</p>

                            of itself as clear evidence that Soviet attack upon the continental U.S.
                            is certain or imminent:</p>
                        <p>a. Penetration of the continental air control and warning system by

                            possessions, the Pacific Trust Territory, the Panama Canal Zone, U.S.
                            armed forces or bases overseas.<note n="6" xml:id="d19fn6">The term
                                “attack” as used in this study refers to offensive action undertaken

                                An “attack” is distinct from a skirmish or armed reconnaissance.

                        <p>10. Any of the following specific Soviet actions should be judged as
                            clear warning that Soviet attack upon the continental U.S. is probably
                            imminent:</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_74" n="74" facs="0098"/>
                        <p>a. Soviet aircraft in a flight pattern capable of attack upon the

                            such a situation might be (1) movement of key atomic technicians to
                            launching sites, (2) extensive standdowns of long-range air units for
                            maximum maintenance, (3) unusual or increased logistical activities
                            under high priority to launching sites, (4) massing of substantial

                            counteraction, might lead to Soviet attack on the continental U.S.:</p>

                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> as Special Assistant to
                            the President for National Security Affairs on April 1, 1955, briefed
                            the Council on the subject, and then introduced Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> said that he would open the
                            presentation on the subject by a general statement with respect to the
                            deployment of U.S. forces world-wide as of December 31, 1954 and as
                            planned by June 30, 1955. Thereafter the four Chiefs of Staff would
                            speak in greater detail on their respective programs.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of his general statement, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> called on General <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName> to describe the status of the
                            Army programs. In general, the Chief of Staff of the Army described the
                            Army’s capabilities as inadequate to carry out its present
                            responsibilities and commitments.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of his report, General <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName> called on Admiral Carney to discuss the status
                            of the Navy’s programs. Admiral Carney’s conclusions were less
                            pessimistic than General <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName>’s, but he did emphasize notable deficiencies in
                            naval capabilities in the Atlantic resulting from the demands on naval
                            capabilities in the Pacific as a result of the disturbed situation in
                            the Formosa area.</p>

                        <p>At the conclusion of Admiral Carney’s report, the President referred to a
                            statement which Admiral Carney had made respecting the deployment
                            commitments of the U.S. Navy. If, asked the President, general war were
                            to break out, would the present large forces of the U.S. Navy be kept in
                            the Western Pacific, or would there be a redeployment from the Pacific
                            to such other area as was the scene of actual hostilities? Admiral
                            Carney replied that present plans in such an emergency called for
                            redeployment from the Pacific to the Atlantic. The President agreed that
                            such a redeployment would have to be undertaken.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Carney then called on General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName>. The Chief of Staff of the Air Force summed up
                            his presentation by reassuring the Council that the Air Force programs
                            were either on schedule or ahead of schedule, except for certain
                            deficiencies which did detract somewhat from its capabilities.
                            Nevertheless, General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName>
                            said that an acceptable combat-ready U.S. Air Force was presently
                            available.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> called on General
                            Shepherd to report on the status of Marine Corps programs. General
                            Shepherd summed up his statement with the observation that in general
                            the Marine Corps programs were advancing satisfactorily, although
                            current personnel reductions would affect to some degree the capability
                            of the Marine Corps to carry out its mission. Nevertheless, he assured
                            the President that the Marine Corps was at this time prepared to carry
                            out its commitments.</p>
                        <p>The President referred to a statement by General Shepherd indicating that
                            while the Marine Corps had sufficient military end items and matériel to
                            enable it to carry out its missions throughout the period
                            D-plus-three-months, there would be difficulties in this field after the
                            expiration of the three-month period. The President asked whether the
                            procurement possibilities after the three-month interval were sufficient
                            to provide what would be necessary for the Marine Corps. General
                            Shepherd answered in the affirmative, but Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> said that this was doubtful
                            if, during the course of the war to that date, an attack on the
                            continental United States had occurred. The President therefore
                            suggested that it might be desirable to provide in some safe place more
                            of the military end items which General Shepherd would need and might
                            not have immediately on hand after the period D-plus-three-months. Dr.
                            Hemming said that we would certainly be in better <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">shape</gloss> if we could stockpile such items in
                            sufficient amounts to last longer than three months. The President
                            thought a six-months stockpile would be appropriate, and Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> replied that such a
                            six-months stockpile would provide the basis for all but the most
                            critical military end items to be stockpiled.</p>

                        <p>At the 247th meeting of the National Security Council, May 5, <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> began his oral briefing on
                            “Significant World Developments Affecting United States Security” with
                            the following comments:</p>
                        <p>“The Director of Central Intelligence informed the Council that the
                            weather in Moscow on May Day had been so bad that the expected fly-bys
                            of new aircraft had not materialized. Accordingly, we were now left with
                            only such evidence on the numbers of the Type 37 jet heavy bomber as we
                            had been able to collect during the period of rehearsals. We believe,
                            continued Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>, that at least eleven such
                            Type 37 bombers had been in the air in Moscow in the rehearsal period.
                            This information, together with evidence on certain other types of
                            aircraft, was in the process of analysis by the Air Force and would be
                            the subject of a report in the near future. Meanwhile Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> expressed some anxiety as to the effect,
                            particularly on members of Congress and the Congressional committees, of
                            news about the appearance of a number of the Type 37 bombers.</p>
                        <p>”The President agreed, and said that it was quite possible that comments
                            would be made on these developments by members of Congress in connection
                            with the hearings on the Defense Department budget.</p>
                        <p>“Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> said that what
                            particularly distressed him was that our intelligence estimates on these
                            Soviet aircraft had proved again to be so badly off track. In point of
                            fact, the Soviets had done just as good a job in the development of the
                            Type 37 bomber as the United States had managed to do with its own
                            counterpart, the B–52 bomber. He repeated that our intelligence was way
                            off the beam.</p>
                        <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> pointed out that
                            we still did not know very much about the speed, performance, and
                            durability of the Type 37 bomber. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> replied that he believed that in these respects
                            the Type 37 bomber compared very favorably with our own heavy bombers
                            and, indeed, that it was indicated that the Soviets had outdistanced us
                            in the jet engine field. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> added that the Soviet Type 37 had four larger jet
                            engines instead of our six jet engines of a smaller size.</p>
                        <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> pointed out that
                            we did not get our intelligence information with regard to these Soviet
                            aircraft by clandestine methods. What we know we get by overt means as
                            circumstances permit. The President said that it was precisely this fact
                            which made him almost apoplectic when our Services published so much
                            information about new weapons development.</p>
                        <p>“Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> said that in any
                            case it was going to be very embarrassing for him when he went back to
                            Capitol Hill to testify before the Congressional committees. He had got
                            a very bad going over last year, owing to faulty intelligence estimates,
                            and he anticipated a worse going over on the next occasion.” (Memorandum

                                before the Magazine Publishers Association at White Sulphur Springs,
                                West Virginia, and that the speech was not published. <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName>’s memorandum stated that the
                                outline was written on the assumption that the speech would be
                                off-the-record and not broadcast or published, adding that he would
                                question the wisdom of publishing this kind of speech. The
                                memorandum further indicated that the speech was given May 23. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.)</note>

                        <p>1. In recent weeks Soviet diplomatic activity has been of a range and
                            intensity unequalled in the last decade. Clearly they are trying very
                            hard to do something; they are engaged in some sort of an important
                            campaign.</p>
                        <p>2. It is most important that we give close study to the implications of
                            what they have done; we must see whether these Soviet efforts afford
                            real opportunities for improving the prospects of peace and freedom.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II Recent Soviet Activity</p>
                        <p>In swift succession the Soviets have:</p>
                        <p>1. signed an Austrian peace treaty which provides for the withdrawal of
                            Russian forces from Austria;</p>
                        <p>2. presented a disarmament proposal which in some respects represents an
                            important narrowing of Western and Soviet differences;</p>
                        <p>3. announced a mission or the very top Soviet leaders to Yugoslavia;</p>
                        <p>4. accepted a proposal to hold talks with the leaders of the U.S., UK,
                            and France;</p>
                        <p>5. held a conference at Warsaw to organize Communist bloc counter to
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>;</p>
                        <p>6. imposed heavy tolls on truck traffic to Berlin inconsistent with 1949
                            agreement on access;</p>
                        <p>7. engaged in a whole series of public statements by Soviet leaders,
                            directed to questions of foreign affairs.</p>
                        <p>(Describe each of above actions briefly.)</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. Reasons for Soviet Activity</p>
                        <p>We cannot pretend to be able to say with certainty just why the Russians
                            are so active. On many things we can only conjecture. But various
                            reasons suggest themselves:</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_80" n="80" facs="0104"/>
                        <p>1. Soviet actions are in large part a reaction to the achievements of the
                            Free World in developing strength and unity through collective means.
                            They are all in some manner related to the important fact that the West
                            has achieved a greater solidarity mainly through <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and that the Federal Republic has
                            become a full partner in the Western Community.</p>
                        <p>2. The Russians may also be coming to realize more fully the tragedies
                            and devastation which would take place if their policies should lead
                            them and the world into a war. They are aware that the growing unity of
                            the West is accompanied by a steadily developing capacity for defense
                            and retaliation. Their own familiarity with the awful consequences of
                            modern weapons may have increased along with their own modern
                            capabilities. We may surmise that the Russians have been sobered by a
                            growing awareness of the meaning of modern war.</p>
                        <p>3. It may also be that the Soviets find themselves overextended; they are
                            having to give massive support and assistance to Communist China; their
                            controls in the satellites cannot be maintained without cost to Russia;
                            their massive military machine is an expensive drain on resources; and
                            their domestic problems in expanding food and consumer goods for their
                            people appear to be giving them some trouble.</p>
                        <p>4. The Russian leadership, or some of the men in it, may have concluded
                            that Russian security and domestic interests have not been well served
                            by previous policies; that those policies have led only to greater
                            strains and potential dangers for Russia itself; and that a changed
                            relationship with the outside world would serve them better. Or they may
                            merely consider that less aggressive tactics are more likely to succeed
                            in dividing the West and lowering its guard.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">IV. Goals of Soviet Action</p>
                        <p>We can see some of the things that the Soviets would like to achieve by
                            their present activity:</p>
                        <p>1. They would like to reverse the admission to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> of the Federal Republic or to forestall the
                            development of German forces, especially with close U.S. collaboration.
                            Toward this end, at Warsaw and elsewhere, they have put forward the idea
                            of a neutralization of “two Germanies”; they have proposed a formula for
                            withdrawal of foreign forces from Germany and a continuation of
                            four-power control as one part of their disarmament proposals; they have
                            talked of the Austrian treaty as a pattern for a German solution.</p>
                        <p>2. They would like to weaken the security aspects of the North Atlantic
                            Treaty and in particular to eliminate U.S. participation in European
                            defense. Toward this end they have included withdrawal from foreign
                            bases in their disarmament proposals; they have inserted in their Warsaw
                            treaty clauses which invite the European <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries <pb xml:id="pg_81" n="81" facs="0105"/>to
                            abandon <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and join in a general
                            European security arrangement with the promise that the Warsaw
                            arrangement would then be abandoned; they have tried to give the
                            impression in statements about the Yugoslavia mission that there is no
                            difficulty in a former antagonist getting along with Russia if only it
                            will abstain from entering collective security treaties which the
                            Soviets do not like; they have sedulously cultivated the ideas of
                            neutrality and neutralism for non-Communist states.</p>
                        <p>3. They may wish to reduce the threat of nuclear war and the economic
                            drain of large armaments. Their recent proposals on disarmament leave
                            many questions unclear but they do constitue a major step toward
                            previous Western positions.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">V. Uncertainties of Soviet Position</p>
                        <p>1. We cannot, however, at this stage foresee to what degree Soviet
                            activities are addressed toward serious negotiation about those major
                            problems which require for solution a considerable change in Soviet
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>2. Thus none of the Soviet actions so far clearly indicates:</p>
                        <p>a. that they are ready to give up their control of East Germany and allow
                            the unification of a genuinely free Germany;</p>
                        <p>b. that they are willing to accept adequately safeguarded disarmament and
                            removal of the threat of atomic weapons;</p>
                        <p>c. that they are willing to extend freedom to the Eastern European
                            satellites.</p>
                        <p>3. Obviously there are good grounds for scepticism in the light of past
                            experience.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">VI. Our Task</p>
                        <p>1. In the coming meeting of Heads of Governments and in the months to
                            come, we must explore carefully the possibilities that there may be some
                            way forward toward just solutions of the problems that now cause
                            tensions between the Soviets and the free world.</p>
                        <p>2. The recent Soviet activities give us some reason for hope that
                            progress may be made. We know that our policies of unity and strength
                            for the free world have already been productive. We can hope that the
                            Russians have become convinced that their own interests will be better
                            served by settling some of the pressing problems of the world. This need
                            not mean that they have suddenly “reformed” but merely that they have
                            adjusted their policies to changed conditions or placed greater emphasis
                            on specific goals, such as security.</p>
                        <p>3. We must not expect miracles. We must not expect rapid or easy
                            solutions. But we must move forward with care and purpose in the hope
                            that we can really achieve a turning of the tide of history.</p>

                            Bombers</p>
                        <p>The President stated that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> wished to make some remarks to the Council
                            regarding the program for the production of the B–52 heavy bomber.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said facilities
                            for the production of B–52 aircraft had recently been doubled. He had
                            not believed, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, that the Soviets would have been able to
                            manufacture as many as ten of their so-called Type 37 heavy bombers in
                            one year. Since they had, however, he believed that we should step up
                            our B–52 production program. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> added that the President had already given his
                            approval to this change in the program, which would now be increased
                            from eleven or twelve B–52’s each month to seventeen a month.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> then alluded to
                            the fact that the Defense Department was getting quite a going-over in
                            the Senate, especially by Senator Symington. Accordingly, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> proposed to tell the
                            appropriate Senate committee about the increase in the B–52 program, and
                            also to tell the committee that there appeared to be no immediate need
                            for additional funds for increasing the production of these aircraft. He
                            had authorized Secretary Talbott to state that the increase in the
                            production of B–52 aircraft had been approved by the President and by
                            the Secretary of Defense.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired how many B–52’s were now actually flying. Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> replied that there
                            were nineteen or twenty.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> added that we
                            were also increasing the program for the production of F–100 aircraft by
                            adding a second facility.</p>
                        <p>At the end of the discussion, the President warned Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> that whatever he did about
                            aircraft production would be subject to politics in Congress.
                            Accordingly, there was no sense in becoming frantic about criticism.</p>

                            Rostow. The report consisted of five chapters and four appendices, plus
                            ten papers prepared by individual panel members. In his covering
                            memorandum, Rostow wrote that the one impression that stood out in his
                            mind was “the unanimous belief of the Panel members that the U.S. now
                            enjoys a significant but transitory period of over-all strength
                            vis-à-vis the Soviet bloc.” He noted further that the “next two or three
                            years afford the United States the opportunity to negotiate from a
                            strong position for genuine concessions by the enemy without sacrifice
                            of essential positions of strength” and that this kind of negotiation,
                            “along with a vigorous and urgent development of potential Free World
                            strength, could create the conditions for victory in the cold war.”
                            Rostow’s covering memorandum and a summary of the recommendations by the
                            panel are printed in volume V, page 216.</p>

                                memorandum of discussion, “the only comment was made by the
                                President to the effect that the people of the world are getting
                                thoroughly scared of the implications of nuclear war. They were
                                running for cover as fast they could go.” (Eisenhower Library,
                                Whitman File, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Records)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. The most important effect in non-Communist countries of growing
                            nuclear capabilities is to diminish the willingness of most governments
                            and peoples to incur risks of war. A second effect is to increase public
                            desire for a reduction of international tensions, and for the use of all
                            possible means, even including those which the governments themselves
                            may consider ill-advised, to work towards a settlement with the
                            Communist powers. Finally, there is increased public pressure on
                            governments to find some means of international disarmament, and
                            especially some means of insuring that nuclear weapons will not be used
                            in war. (<hi rend="italic">Para. 18</hi>)</p>
                        <p>2. Evidence from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> indicates that
                            the Soviet rulers are well aware of the nature and the power of nuclear
                            weapons, which had generally been minimized publicly in Stalin’s time.
                            We believe that they are deeply concerned by the implication of these
                            weapons. US nuclear capabilities almost certainly constitute a major
                            deterrent to overt military aggression by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. (<hi rend="italic">Paras. 13–14, 22</hi>)</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_86" n="86" facs="0110"/>
                        <p>3. As nuclear capabilities further increase, and the possibilities of
                            mutual devastation grow, the tendencies to caution and compromise
                            presently discernible in non-Communist countries will probably be
                            accentuated. Aversion to risks of war, pressures for disarmament, and
                            fear of general war, will almost certainly be more marked than now. The
                            difficulties of conducting policy against such adversaries as the
                            Communist leaders will probably be increased, and the chances may become
                            greater of a weakening of the non-Communist position by successive
                            concessions. At the same time the Soviet leaders themselves, because of
                            their recognition of the devastating effects of nuclear weapons, will
                            still almost certainly be concerned not to pursue aggressive actions to
                            the point of incurring substantial risk of general war. (<hi rend="italic">Para. 26</hi>)</p>
                        <p>4. We believe that the allies of the US, and especially the major allies,
                            will continue in the alliance despite the increase of nuclear
                            capabilities, at least as long as general war does not appear imminent.
                            If general war appeared imminent or actually occurred, their policies
                            would depend in large measure on the course of events. Some of the
                            allies might have no choice, and could not remain uninvolved even if
                            they wished to do so. Some might consider the issues at stake
                            insufficiently important to risk general war, and might therefore
                            declare themselves neutral at an early stage of the crisis. Some
                            governments might estimate that full-scale nuclear war between the US
                            and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would end with complete or
                            near complete destruction of the war-making potential of both powers,
                            and therefore that neutrality might be both a safe and a profitable
                            position. If events developed in such a way as to confront governments
                            with a clear and immediate choice between nuclear devastation and
                            neutrality, we believe that practically all would choose neutrality.
                                (<hi rend="italic">Paras. 27, 30</hi>)</p>
                        <p>5. As its nuclear capabilities grow, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will have a greatly increased capability to inflict
                            destruction, particularly on the US itself. Nevertheless, the Soviet
                            leaders will probably still not be confident that they could attack the
                            US with nuclear weapons without exposing the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to an even more devastating counterblow. We believe,
                            therefore, that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will continue
                            to try to avoid substantial risks of general war despite the increase of
                            its nuclear capabilities. However, as these capabilities grow, Soviet
                            leaders may come to estimate that the US, because of fear for itself or
                            for its allies, or because of pressure by its allies, will be
                            increasingly deterred from initiating full-scale nuclear war. They may
                            therefore come to belive that local wars will be less likely than at
                            present to expand into general war, and thus that superior Bloc military
                            capabilities in certain local areas can be exercised without substantial
                            risk of provoking general war. (<hi rend="italic">Para. 31</hi>)</p>

                            by the three Services. <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> had no remarks at this point. Major General
                            Gerhart thereupon advised the Council that the Services’ presentations
                            would be made by the following individuals; Colonel Bothwell, <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>, who briefed the Council on the
                            status of the Air Force elements of the Continetal Defense program;
                            Colonel Turner, <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>, who briefed the
                            Council on the Army elements of the Continental Defense program; and
                            Captain Leverton, <gloss target="#t_USN1">USN</gloss>, who briefed the
                            Council on the Navy elements of the Continental Defense program.
                            Following the completion of the presentation by the Services (covering
                            65 minutes), Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> called on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> to give the highlights of his
                            independent views on the Department of Defense report. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> then summarized the highlights
                            of his June 16, 1955 report on the subject, copies of which were
                            available on the Council table throughout the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting.<note n="4" xml:id="d28fn4">A copy of this
                                report is in the Eisenhower Library, Sp. Asst. for Nat. Sec. Affairs
                                Records. In a June 14 memorandum to the Acting Secretary of State,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Robert Bowie</persName> stated that
                                the essence of the Defense Department’s progress report was that
                                some programs were doing well while others were behind schedule, but
                                that the implications of greatest interest in this report were those
                                brought out by Robert Sprague:<p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> comes to a conclusion of great
                                    significance to our national security and basic national
                                    security policies set forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5501. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> concludes: (a) that at the present rate
                                    of development of our continental defense system the Soviets by
                                    mid-1957 will be able to destroy our nuclear retaliatory power
                                    by surprise attack; (b) that the situation can be rectified if
                                    certain programs are speeded up or enhanced; and (c) that to do
                                    so might cost during the next two years about $500 million in
                                    addition to funds presently programmed for continental defense
                                    (this figure represents a personal estimate on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName>’s part and is not
                                    contained in his memorandum). It is also his personal belief
                                    that if the Administration or the Congress is unwilling to
                                    appropriate additional moneys for this purpose the necessary
                                    funds should be taken from other programs.</p>
                                <p>“It is quite possible that the Joint Chiefs and Secretary of
                                    Defense will dispute Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName>’s conclusion, but it is a subject of
                                    such critical importance to our national security and our
                                    national strategy that any doubt should be resolved in favor of
                                    greater efforts so that our retaliatory force, at least, will
                                    receive greater protection at an earlier date.” (Department of

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> mentioned at this
                            point that Defense had already planned stepped-up production of our
                            B–52’s by 35% and, in addition, had asked for the transfer of additional
                            funds to the Secretary of Defense for allocation for research purposes
                            in those areas of continental military defense which seemed most
                            promising.</p>
                        <p>The President said he was grateful to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> for his contribution, and mentioned that, if he
                            were Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName>, he would not be
                            apologetic in advancing differing views from other individuals who, like
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName>, were also concerned
                            with our Continental Defense problems.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> referred to the
                            figures used in that portion of the <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> report of June 16 which reflected that by
                            mid-1957 the Russians would have [<hi rend="italic">1 number not
                                declassified</hi>] modern bombers in operation. He said that while
                            these figures were taken from <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>’s
                                estimates,<note n="5" xml:id="d28fn5">

                            deal of care before final conclusions were reached on Soviet long-range
                            delivery capabilities. He said that while he would not discount the
                            increased attention being devoted to long-range delivery capabilities by
                            the Soviets, he personally was inclined to the [<hi rend="italic">1 word
                                not declassified</hi>] estimate, which takes a somewhat less
                            alarmist view than the estimate prepared by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and used by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> in his June 16 report. He said that while the
                            situation was more grave than indicated by the intelligence estimate of
                            last November, he thought that more study was needed before firm
                            conclusions were reached on the basis of the evidence now available.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, reverting to his
                            prior reference to the stepped-up production program for the B–52,
                            mentioned that some 200,000 people in the United States were now working
                            either directly or indirectly on the B–52; that the plane was a very
                            good one; and that Defense felt the production program for the B–52 was
                            now ready to be pushed with safety. As to this point, the President
                            observed that this increased production would result in putting more
                            planes on the same number of <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>
                            bases.</p>
                        <p>The President then commented that the value of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName>’s survey was not limited to
                            questions of the intelligence estimate alone; that its great value lay
                            in making us reassess our programs in relation to the major items raised
                            by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> for the purpose of
                            seeing if we were placing proper emphasis on the right programs. He said
                            that our great objective here is (a) to avert disaster, and (b) to win
                            the war, if it comes. He added that he personally would agree with the
                            more conservative estimate of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>’s long-range air delivery capability.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_90" n="90" facs="0114"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, noting that
                            our Government was placing great reliance on its massive retaliatory
                            capability, said he would like to know if the Air Force thought an
                            attack, such as that earlier described by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName>, could wipe out our retaliatory
                            capability. He asked if 15 or 16 bombs on our <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> bases could put us out of business. <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General Twining</persName> replied that he did
                            not think a small attack could have that effect. He said the Air Force
                            was more concerned over a larger attack. He stated that in the event of
                            an attack such as that described by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName>, it would be impossible for all the attacking
                            aircraft to come in simultaneously over their respective targets; as a
                            consequence, with the first attacking plane we would disperse other
                                <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> aircraft. <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General Twining</persName> then went on to say
                            that the Air Force did not believe it should plan to build fighters with
                            interceptor capability at 57,000 feet. He said that if we were about to
                            do that, we couldn’t do anything else. He concluded that he did not
                            think the Soviets would sacrifice their heavy, long-range aircraft on a
                            one-way mission with complete strategic surprise, as suggested by Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Strauss then asked <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General
                                Twining</persName> how much time would be required to get all <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> planes in the air, assuming there was
                            some warning, and <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General
                                Twining</persName> replied that he thought it would be possible to
                            get about 80% of the bombers off pretty fast and that the remainder,
                            exclusive of <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> aircraft undergoing
                            repairs or refit-tings, could be gotten off the ground within a period
                            of one hour to 1½ hours.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> expressed appreciation to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> on behalf of the Council for
                            the work he had performed, and then went on to discussion of the <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> report.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> summarized the highlights of the <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> report, noting that emergency
                            relocation plans to insure the continuity of essential functions of the
                            Executive Branch had reached a high state of readiness, and that there
                            had been no substantial change in the status of the following
                            continental defense programs which are the responsibility of <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss>: (a) emergency plans for the relocation
                            of the Legislative and Judicial Branches; (b) plans for the

                            from the Washington, D.C. target area; (c) plans for continuity of
                            industry, reduction of urban vulnerability, and physical security of

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> said that he had no

                            this time, adding that in the evaluation exercise to follow on June 17,
                            the officials concerned would assess the effectiveness of <pb xml:id="pg_91" n="91" facs="0115"/>emergency relocation plans being

                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName> said that in the

                            late, but it was not anywhere near an acceptable level. He said that in
                            the final analysis, the safety of the American people in our large
                            cities rested on passive defense, i.e., civil defense, which placed a
                            tremendous responsibility on our civil defense forces. He noted that
                            under the present law, State and local governments had primary
                            responsibility for civil defense. He said that at their last conference,
                            the Governors were agreed that primary responsibility for civil defense
                            should not rest on the local people alone; that it should be a shared
                            responsibility, i.e., shared between the Federal and the local
                            governments. He said that he had asked the Governors to submit their
                            proposed solution to this problem, and when the solution was submitted
                            it would be staffed through the normal mechanism and eventually
                            submitted to the President. He said that it might well be that the U.S.
                            would have to have such a program, and to that end it might be necessary
                            for the Administration to seek increased authority and responsibility
                            for <gloss target="#t_FCDA1">FCDA</gloss> in this field. He said that he
                            was fearful that when <gloss target="#t_FCDA1">FCDA</gloss> came up with
                            recommendations for sound civil defense programs it would encounter
                            severe budgetary problems. He concluded with the view that in this very
                            involved field <gloss target="#t_FCDA1">FCDA</gloss> should proceed
                            slowly and carefully before pushing too hard for greatly increased
                            programs.</p>

                        <p>The President inquired whether <gloss target="#t_FCDA1">FCDA</gloss>
                            expected to get the additional funds totaling $12 million which have
                            been requested for civil defense research and related purposes. Governor
                                <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName> replied that he
                            thought that the Congress would appropriate these funds.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> next took up the <gloss target="#t_IIC1">IIC</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_ICIS1">ICIS</gloss>
                            report, noting that the several programs assigned to the Committees were

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> next recommended <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> action on the third series of progress
                            reports along the lines indicated in the final paragraph of this
                            memorandum.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> inquired how soon the
                            Council would consider the agency comments on the <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> committee recommendations. Mr.
                                <persName>Anderson</persName> indicated that they had been
                            tentatively scheduled for <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            consideration in July,<note n="7" xml:id="d28fn7">See <ref target="#d25">Document 25</ref>.</note> but that they might have to be
                            postponed because of more urgent matters. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> said that his inquiry was
                            based upon his concern that the agency responses to the <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> recommendations be considered
                            in sufficient time to be related to the preparation of the budget for
                            the next fiscal year.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that a lot
                            of progress was being made in some of the areas referred to both in the
                            Department of Defense report on Continental Defense and in the <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> report, and that, in so far as
                            the <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> recommendations were
                            concerned, he would be inclined to take a little more time in order to
                            do a better job.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> observed that it
                            would be well to have in mind that if the Soviets attempted a strike
                            against the United States, they would probably be making all types of
                            peaceful overtures just prior to the attack. Accordingly, Governor
                                <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> emphasized the
                            necessity of good intelligence in order that there would be advance
                            warning of an impending attack.</p>
                        <p>The President observed that this brought up the political aspects of the
                            situation again. He said he knew of few cases in history wherein a
                            government, after making a great many peaceful overtures, attempted a
                            surprise attack; he said in those circumstances such political
                            aggressors would have to take into account public and world opinion.</p>
                        <p>The President said he agreed with the recommended <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> action.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_93" n="93" facs="0117"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said he
                            understood that action to mean that when something new came up, the same
                            general principles would apply as had applied in the past. He emphasized
                            the necessity of weighing various aspects of the Continental Defense
                            program on their relative merits, stating that if it were decided to
                            accelerate greatly one particular aspect, efforts should be made to find
                            other less important programs which could be cut down to compensate
                            therefor, [<hi rend="italic">remainder of paragraph (3 lines of source

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRR1">Hughes</persName> said he assumed that
                            the recommended action at today’s meeting would not be taken as a change
                            of policy, to which the President responded that one change had already
                            been indicated—namely, the stepped-up production in the B–52 program.
                            The President added that he thought it necessary to use a rule of reason
                            in assessing the various programs involved.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that if
                            you don’t think about offsetting moves to compensate for increased
                            programs, budgetary-wise and tax-wise the Government would be placed in
                            a considerable bind unless there was real reason to change our policies,
                            in which event it would be necessary to seek an increase in the tax
                            program next year.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that he did
                            not favor any effort to bring before the Council by July final agency
                            comments on the <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> report,
                            to which Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> responded that comments were
                            now in from all agencies in one form or another.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName> mentioned the
                            psychological and morale aspects of the subject, saying that he thought
                            there should be a psychological plan to dovetail with the Continental
                            Defense program.</p>
                        <p>The President, noting Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName>’s observation, said that there would be
                            great chaos in the event of an attack, and consequently these
                            psychological and related factors had to be carefully considered. Mr.
                                <persName>Anderson</persName> suggested that these factors might be
                            included in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5408 when revised.</p>
                        <p>The Attorney General inquired if there wouldn’t be some advance warning,
                            such as large troop movements in satellite countries, etc., in the event
                            of the attack on our <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> bases envisaged
                            by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The President said he would think it odd if we received no warning at
                            all, mentioning that our Air Force was unable to effect attacks with
                            complete surprise during World War II, citing the air strikes against
                            the Ploesti fields as an example. The President said that we were unable
                            to make such attacks with complete surprise; that the enemy had warning
                            of such attacks each time they were mounted.</p>
                        <p>The President reiterated his concurrence in the action recommended by Mr.
                                <persName>Anderson</persName>.</p>

                        <p>The Council discussion was introduced by a briefing by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName> on the <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> report and the agency
                            responses. Following a general introduction of the subject he proceeded

                        <p>In connection with paragraph a of the proposed action, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> inquired whether the Planning
                            Board’s recommendation meant that the Planning Board would report back
                            to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> on the Timetable before it
                            completed its review of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5501. The
                            President stated that since the Timetable affects the other Panel
                            recommendations, he assumed that the Planning Board would make such a
                            report prior to completion of its review.<note n="5" xml:id="d30fn5">Reference is to “A Timetable of Change in Our Military Position

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> noted that
                            Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>’s presentation
                            on disarmament had also included a timetable, and it had been the
                            Secretary’s understanding that this <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> timetable would be a guide to what our
                            disarmament program should be. He inquired of Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> as to whether this was not
                            correct.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> confirmed the
                            Secretary’s statement, and stated that his timetable was one covering
                            ten years. It is the second five years which we would like to avoid. Any
                            speed-up of the timetable would therefore be of significance to our
                            disarmament policy.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_96" n="96" facs="0120"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> went on to say
                            that he didn’t want to leave the impression in this discussion that our
                            international policy was determined and enforced by obliteration and
                            warfare such as was envisaged in the Timetable and the Panel’s
                            recommendation. Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>
                            thought that that was not what the Panel had in mind. The Panel’s
                            premise was that the Soviets would be more amenable during the period
                            when they had, and knew that they had, a lesser power position, than
                            they would be later. It didn’t mean that we should use our relative
                            military advantage for military purposes.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he assumed that what was intended here was the
                            same thing that we meant when we talked about negotiating from strength.
                            He also believed that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ view was correct.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> suggested that
                            the Soviets might desire a period of peace during which they could pull
                            their manpower out of the army and put it into agriculture while they
                            concentrated their military effort on such things as the missiles
                            program.</p>
                        <p>The President said that in everything we have placed reliance on the
                            Timetable; it should therefore be reviewed and a report made back to the
                            Council. The Council should be notified of any radical change in the
                            Timetable while the work is still going forward on the revision of basic
                            policy. Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> pointed out that the Planning
                            Board planned to examine the policy implications of the Timetable and
                            report back to the Council on them. The President said that that was
                            true, but there should nonetheless be a report back on the Timetable
                            itself which would indicate the changes that should be made in the
                            various periods described.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> told the Council that
                            the Panel members concerned had recently reconsidered Period II in the
                            light of recent intelligence, and that it was their unanimous opinion
                            that the period may end nearer the end of 1958 than in 1960. There had
                            been estimated an improvement in Soviet delivery capabilities but not in
                            their nuclear weapons capabilities since the date of the Panel
                            report.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> then presented the briefing note
                            regarding paragraphs b through d. After he had introduced paragraph d,
                            he said that he believed the President had some views as to the kind of
                            briefing that he desired on the vulnerability of <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>. The President said that the kind of briefing that
                            would be valuable to the Council was not one which would go into great
                            detail on the kinds of protection that might be provided, but one which
                            would indicate where we were exposed and how badly, and that would give
                            some idea of what could be done about the situation.</p>
                        <p>After Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName>’s presentation of paragraph f of
                            the proposed action, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName>
                            said that it was true that there was general agreement among the
                            agencies concerned that it would not be practical <pb xml:id="pg_97" n="97" facs="0121"/>to set up an office to handle the rapid
                            interchange and rerouting of communications traffic, but there was still
                            some feeling that the basic idea in the Panel recommendation should not
                            be dropped. He felt, for example, that it would be useful to have a
                            display center at which the status of our communications networks would
                            be clearly indicated at all times. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> also felt that it would be desirable to work
                            out a three-Service procedure, under which each Service would transmit,
                            on the same basis as its own first-priority messages, the first-priority
                            messages of the other Services. He felt that these proposals could be
                            worked out by the agencies.</p>
                        <p>The President said that every time a new function or need was identified,
                            it was suggested that a new department be set up. This led to confusion
                            and overlapping. Nonetheless, the idea that, in the event of extensive
                            jamming, rapid action would be required to get warning information
                            through to responsible officials, was, he felt valid. He would like, he
                            said, to have this matter followed up and reported on to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that Defense was the only department that
                            could do the things proposed. In response, the President said that if
                            this were the case, Defense should be the department to report. Mr.
                                <persName>Anderson</persName> said that he believed that the action
                            the President desired could be taken under the Council action proposed
                            by the Planning Board. In response, the President said that it could be
                            done, but he wanted to know whether it was done.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">Note</hi>: The following portion of this memorandum
                            was dictated by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSJ1">Lay</persName> from Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>’s notes.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> spoke from his briefing notes regarding
                            paragraph g. He added that prior to revision of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5501, the Planning Board would be submitting, within
                            the next thirty days, related policy recommendations as to U.S. action
                            in the event hostilities are renewed in Indochina.</p>
                        <p>The President said he wished to issue one word of warning. From the
                            beginning, the U.S. has pursued a policy of supporting the free world
                            economically and militarily, and has regarded itself as a central
                            reserve ideologically, militarily and industrially. However, we do not
                            want to get the idea that wherever there is a peripheral war we will
                            send off U.S. expeditionary forces. Ground forces for such wars will
                            have to be supplied indigenously, and we are trying to build them up.
                            Support will come from us with our mobile reserve of naval and air
                            forces and logistic support. If this sort of aggression, however, gets
                            to be too common, we may have to fight a major war because we can’t go
                            around wasting our strength, [<hi rend="italic">remainder of this

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> then presented the briefing note

                        <p>The President commented that, as he recalled his decision, U.S.
                            capability to damage the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was
                            included in the net evaluation directive.<note n="6" xml:id="d30fn6">Reference is to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5511, “A Net

                                see <ref target="#d10">Document 10</ref>.</note> He said that he had
                            always talked about reciprocal action and counter-action, and assumed
                            that it would be included in any such study. We have to calculate what

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> assured the
                            President that the first 30-day war period is being war-gamed to show
                            the damage we could do to the Russian Air Force but not to Russian
                            industry.</p>
                        <p>The President said that “You have assumed, then, that they will attack us
                            in the same way—that is, hit our <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>—as
                            we would attack them.”</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said that Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> had been planning,
                            in the report to the Council of the Net Evaluation Subcommittee, to show
                            only what had been done to the U.S., but that he (<persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName>) was sure that the report
                            could show the effect of our attacks on the Russian Air Force.</p>
                        <p>The President stated that, if we are confining U.S. attacks initially to
                            the Russian <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>, the present study will
                            give the picture. He agreed that we should knock out their <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> first.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> thought that in the present study the
                            U.S. attack on the Russian <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> was
                            incidental, and he thought that the President wanted a complete
                            evaluation on the other side, namely, what we could do to them.</p>
                        <p>The President said that, if our plans for attack don’t include other
                            targets, then we don’t need a complete evaluation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> asked whether the President wished,
                            therefore, that the study be completed as planned. The President
                            wondered whether we should not also study, after the first thirty days
                            are over, then what do we do?</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> believed that it was
                            not necessary to wait until the October 1st report to decide whether to

                        <p>The President thought that it would be sufficient to be sure that General
                            George was taking account of our power to damage the Russian <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> then presented his briefing notes on
                            paragraphs i, j and k.</p>
                        <p>Regarding informing the public on civil defense, the President admitted
                            that this was very difficult because we want to avoid hysteria on one
                            side and complacency on the other. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> commented that what we should say also depends on
                            the reaction of our foreign friends. Governor <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName> stated that, for the first time, <gloss target="#t_FCDA1">FCDA</gloss> got enough money from Congress to do
                            more basic research, and he thought that we should now do more working
                            and less talking in the next few months. The President summed up by
                            saying “ We will have to figure out what the various agencies (<gloss target="#t_FCDA1">FCDA</gloss>, Defense, <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>, and others) should keep before the public on this
                            subject.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">2 paragraphs (½ page of source text) not
                                declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>With regard to the recommended improvement of continental defense
                            relations with Canada, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> thought we shouldn’t just turn that
                            recommendation down, since all the Panel meant was to keep it under
                            constant reexamination. The President thought this was true of any
                            aspect of our relations with all countries.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the recommended extension of the three-mile limit, Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> thought the panel
                            was concerned with controlling hostile vessels approaching our shores in
                            the event that a sea plot indicated unusual concentrations of such
                            vessels. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> said that
                            the Panel had no disagreement with what is proposed by the agencies and
                            the Planning Board.<note n="8" xml:id="d30fn8">This reference and others
                                in this document are to the agency comments and proposals conveyed
                                in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5522.</note> Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> asked if we were being
                            realistic in this matter. The President admitted that the three-mile
                            limit had been set by the range of cannon on sailing ships. However, he
                            thought that when we have a strong Navy and the other side is weak, this
                            limit is to our advantage. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he always gets concerned where technological
                            change requires a reexamination of old concepts. He thought we sometimes
                            tend to put our heads in the sand. The President thought this was a good
                            general proposition, but questions its applicability here. However, he
                            suggested that Defense might study this further and bring any
                            suggestions before the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> if
                            necessary.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> stated that he understood that, with
                            regard to the rejection of the recommendation that Nike’s be free to
                            fire at planes above a certain altitude, the Panel concurred in the
                            Defense comment. In answer to the President’s question as to how long it
                            takes Nike to get in the air, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> said that some are on 15-minute alert.</p>
                        <p>After briefing the Council on paragraphs 1 and m, Mr.
                                <persName>Anderson</persName> explained the split views in paragraph
                            n.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_100" n="100" facs="0124"/>
                        <p>The President said that, if we just continue to look over the shoulders
                            of the people in charge of these various projects, we will interfere
                            with their work. He would rather take the judgment of the department
                            heads on this matter. If we overload the staffs with reports, things are
                            glossed over and dished up to us. He suggested that the next time this
                            subject is reported on, he would like use made of maps and diagrams to
                            show the Panel recommendations and where the departments agreed and
                            where they didn’t. He thought such visual aids would show the position
                            where the Panel recommendations would place the U.S. defensively and how
                            far the departments would go along with them. Mr.
                                <persName>Anderson</persName> suggested that the next status reports
                            from the agencies, such as Defense, could be done in that way.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName>, noting that certain
                            items are earmarked for report by December 1, suggested that thirty days
                            prior to that the responsible agencies should be provided with an
                            opportunity to make a progress report on significant developments.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> asked how do we
                            get out of this reporting system. We bury ourselves in paper work so
                            that there are too many reports and not enough people working. Mr.
                                <persName>Anderson</persName> commented that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> felt that the earliest a
                            meaningful report would be possible is the year’s period suggested by
                            the majority.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> agreed regarding an
                            over-all report, but thought that some recommendations were so
                            significant we should have a progress report on them in the meantime. He
                            commented that we have had an outstanding group of scientists make this
                            study, and therefore shouldn’t just put it on the shelf, but give some
                            assurance of a follow-through.</p>
                        <p>The President said it would be all right if the agencies thought that a
                            progress report would be desirable, but that he would not put it on the
                            schedule. In answer to Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName>, the President
                            said that the progress reports should be largely on a voluntary
                            basis.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> said there was
                            one aspect which affected his disarmament studies. He noted that the
                            heartland of the free world was the East-Central industrial triangle of
                            the United States. One of our strengths is that this area is so much
                            further from the Russians than their targets are from us. A 1500-mile
                            missile is therefore more important to us than to the Russians. Governor
                                <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> felt that having this
                            project a component development of a 5500-mile missiles is not enough,
                            particularly in a matter where we are as far behind as we now know. He
                            thought we should make the 1500-mile missile a special objective rather
                            than a part of the 5500-mile missile development.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_101" n="101" facs="0125"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> noted that the
                            decision was made some years ago not to push the 1500-mile missile.
                            Defense is now reviewing five plans and will come up in December with
                            its choice. We now have additional information we didn’t have at the
                            time the original decision was made.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> believed that if
                            we just look at the 1500-mile missile as part of the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program, it would not move as fast as
                            if it were a separate project. Yet the 1500-mile missile would cancel
                            out the advantage the Russians would otherwise gain by achieving the
                            5500-mile missile first.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> pointed out that
                            there are other developments for the 1500-mile range, such as pilotless
                            ships that will fly faster and more accurately and can do the trick
                            better than a missile.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General Twining</persName> pointed out that
                            we may not always have our overseas bases to launch the 1500-mile
                            missile. Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>
                            nevertheless thought that there should be another project on the
                            1500-mile missile if we assume our bases are available. On such an
                            important matter Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>
                            felt we needed to bet on two or three possibilities.</p>
                        <p>The President said he agreed in general with Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>’s point. However, if the
                            Russians can fire 1000 a day at us and we can fire 1000 a day at them,
                            then he personally would want to take off for the Argentine. Governor
                                <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> commented that we
                            still need them in order to keep the Russians from starting to use them
                            against us. The President agreed that we do need some of these missiles
                            as a threat and a deterrent; but we don’t want to produce them in
                            quantity because we can’t fight that kind of a war.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that we
                            don’t want to put all our eggs in the 1500-mile basket because our bases
                            are doubtful. [<hi rend="italic">1 sentence (23 words) not

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that he was
                            worried about the number of new projects we have already. Once they get
                            started, we can’t stop. Congress will always vote for new stuff (such as
                            opposing the reduction of Marine strength), but it will never eliminate
                            old projects or provide the taxes to pay for new ones.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> thought that the
                            decision made earlier on the 1500-mile missile was now shown to be
                            wrong. <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General Twining</persName> pointed
                            out that availability of bases had been an important element in that
                            decision. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said
                            that big rockets cost twice as much or more than a plane, and can only
                            be used once.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed to the December 1st reporting date on the 1500-mile
                            missile. However, he thought that Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>’s point was valid, that we should exploit the
                            advantage now of our overseas <pb xml:id="pg_102" n="102" facs="0126"/>bases. At some future time we may have to take account of the
                            possibility that they will not be available, and so the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> must also be pushed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> pointed out that both
                            the long- and medium-range missiles aren’t going to replace manned
                            bombers, for three reasons: First, they are one-way devices; secondly,
                            they can carry a much smaller warhead, but are also expensive in
                            fissionable material; and third, their accuracy is less. On the other
                            hand, they are a nasty thing to defend against, and therefore we need
                            that program. He said that the Panel agreed with the Planning Board’s
                            recommendation for delay until December 1st to pick the best
                            approach.</p>
                        <p>The President stated vigorously that, if this is the only means of waging
                            war, he would never wage it. If we wage such a war to establish respect
                            for free government in Europe and Asia, we won’t have that type of
                            government left ourselves. He thought we should develop a few of these
                            missiles as a threat, but not 1000 or more. The nature of conflict has
                            gotten beyond man. We are getting to the point where it is no longer
                            worthwhile to have the operating staffs study such a war.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> commented that,
                            as we approach this period, peripheral wars will become more important
                            as general war is no longer possible. Then what do you do? The President
                            thought that when you start a little fight there is every chance that it
                            will get larger. Korea stayed a little war, and we have criticized
                            others for their action to keep it so.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> thought that
                            little people can fight little wars, but big people such as us cannot
                            fight little wars.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed the hope that the future character of war will
                            repel men from the use of force. In a few years it may be possible for
                            Guatemala to build these weapons to threaten us. The President noted
                            that Mr. Baruch brought up this possibility to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in 1946 or 1947 in trying to sell

                            flight about thirty minutes. Its launching platforms could be made
                            almost invulnerable to attack and an effective defense against it would
                            be extremely difficult, if possible, No more than fifteen minute warning
                            appears attainable.</p>

                        <p>Obviously, as stated in the action proposed by the Planning Board
                            (paragraph a), “There would be the gravest repercussions on the national
                            security and on the cohesion of the free world, should the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> achieve an operational capability

                            of the U.S.”</p>
                        <p>In the Defense Department the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                            program is already rated as “highest priority”. About 180 other
                            projects, however, are said to enjoy this same rating. Moreover, it is
                            understood that, even with this rating, the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program has been seriously delayed by the existing <pb xml:id="pg_111" n="111" facs="0135"/>procedures for clearance and
                            approval. It has been estimated that as much as a year or more could be
                            saved by cutting through some of this procedural routine.</p>
                        <p>To draft an <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> action which will have
                            this effect is difficult. The Planning Board was told that the Secretary
                            of Defense has the authority to short cut the routine procedures.
                            Doubtless to do so will entail certain risks of waste of funds and
                            effort. In view of the stakes involved, it appears that these risks
                            should be taken.</p>
                        <p>The proposed action appears to be as good as can be devised for this
                            purpose. Much will still depend on how it is applied but it serves to
                            highlight the crucial importance of this program and the necessity of
                            the utmost expedition in carrying it through.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> indicated that
                            there were two questions he would like to ask. First, he would like to
                            ask <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General Twining</persName> how really
                            superior the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> was to airplane
                            delivery of nuclear weapons in the event of U.S. retaliation, on the
                            assumption that the Russians <pb xml:id="pg_112" n="112" facs="0136"/>had a 5000-mile missile with a considerable degree of accuracy as to
                            the point of delivery. Secondly, he would like to inquire, from the
                            point of view of the United States and with the world situation as it
                            was today, how much advantage there was in the possession of a 5000-mile
                            missile as compared with a 1500-mile missile.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> undertook to
                            answer Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>’s two
                            questions. He said that, in the first place, it was most desirable to
                            place the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> in its proper
                            perspective. It was not in itself a single entity, but rather part of a
                            program, which program of the Department of Defense contained two other
                            significant missiles programs, though admittedly these other programs
                            did not have the potentialities of the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>. The first of these two was the “Navajo” project,
                            which Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> briefly
                            described. He thereafter pointed out that the Navajo weapon would be of
                            great help to us if we came out second-best to the Soviets in achieving
                            the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>. He said he also wished to
                            emphasize that of course our manned aircraft capability was still the
                            most important single capability in this field.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> then asked a
                            further question, as to the significance of the difference in
                            capabilities between the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> and the
                            manned aircraft. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> replied that the manned aircraft was superior to
                            the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>, both in accuracy and weight
                            of destructive force. He added that the appraisal of the importance of
                            the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> set forth in the Council
                            action proposed by the Planning Board constituted an exactly correct
                            appraisal. However, this appraisal needed to be viewed in the context of
                            the whole problem, in which case the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> would appear as a back-up weapon rather than as the
                            prime weapon.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President and Govenor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> concurrently raised the question of the terrific
                            speed of the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>. Did not this speed
                            carry with it the danger that the Soviets would be able to destroy U.S.
                            retaliatory capabilities with the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>?
                            To Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> this seemed
                            the crucial aspect of the problem. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> replied that this would certainly be true if the
                            Soviets were able to achieve a sufficient number of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>’s with the necessary degree of
                            accuracy in delivery. But that they should be able to do so required a
                            very great stretch of the imagination. Moreover, the fears that Governor
                                <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> had expressed applied
                            more cogently to our overseas bases than to our bases on the American
                            continent. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName>
                            expressed the opinion that the Russians were not likely to achieve the
                            requisite number of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>’s with the
                            requisite degree of accuracy in the period up to 1960.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> then said that
                            the accuracy of the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> and its
                            devastating effects would of course depend on Soviet achievement of
                            thermonuclear warheads for their <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> replied that
                            this was likely.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_113" n="113" facs="0137"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> then stated to
                            the Council that it was his judgment that we ought to make the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program a program of continuous
                            development but not something which must be attained next year.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> commented that
                            the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program possessed all the
                            priority and importance which the proposed <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> action confers on it. He believed that we should give
                            the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program all of the backing
                            which we can practicably.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> then inquired as to
                            the meaning of the term “a program of highest priority” as contained in
                            subparagraph c of the proposed <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                                action.<note n="4" xml:id="d34fn4">See paragraph a (3) of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action below.</note> Did, for
                            example, the term “highest priority” indicate an overriding priority?
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> replied that
                            ascribing to the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> the highest
                            priority, as was done in the proposed <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> action, would put the Secretary of Defense in the
                            position of being able to issue a directive to get ahead with the
                            prosecution of the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program in such
                            fashion that no other priority program would interfere with it. This
                            priority prevailed against all other priorities unless it was the
                            judgment of the Secretary of Defense that it was desirable to modify
                            this course of action. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> said he understood that in effect there were
                            two or three programs in this top priority category which from time to
                            time might have to be maneuvered. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> confirmed that such was his understanding.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> then said that it was
                            his understanding that if the proposed action were accepted, the
                            National Security Council would gets its first report on the development
                            of the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program next December. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName> confirmed Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName>’s understanding, and
                            indicated the likelihood that the report on the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program would be given to the National Security
                            Council at approximately the same time (December) that the Department of
                            Defense would report on the progress made in achieving the 1500-mile
                                missile.<note n="5" xml:id="d34fn5">See <ref target="#d44">Document
                                    44</ref>. The report was discussed by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> on December 1; see <ref target="#d45">Document 45</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Vice President said that he understood that no warning system would
                            operate against an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> replied that it was
                            the belief of the Defense Department that we could perhaps attain at
                            least a 15-minute warning of the approach of an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>. He pointed out that once such a missile enters the
                            upper atmosphere it is committed to a certain course. Accordingly, we
                            would know where it would land, and this knowledge gave hope of
                            providing 15 minutes for people to take cover before the strike
                            occurred.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_114" n="114" facs="0138"/>
                        <p>The Vice President then turned to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_VNJ1">Von
                                Neumann</persName> and asked him whether, in his judgment, the
                            proposed <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> action on the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program “went far enough”. In
                            responding, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_VNJ1">Von Neumann</persName>
                            emphasized that he was speaking for himself only and not for the
                            Chairman, <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>. He then went on to say
                            that while he might be accused of merely playing with words, it seemed
                            to him desirable to change the wording in subparagraph d<note n="6" xml:id="d34fn6">See paragraph a (4) of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action below.</note> to read that the program would
                            be prosecuted “with all possible speed” rather than as written, “with
                            all practicable speed”. Such a change would probably make no substantial
                            difference in the actual prosecution of the program, but it might be
                            useful. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_VNJ1">Von Neumann</persName> then went
                            on to comment that the task of intercepting an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> was horribly difficult. Once it was launched, all that
                            we would know is what city it was going to hit. Moreover, the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> would be able to take at least some
                            slight evasive action. Only a very heavy atomic missile could possibly
                            intercept it.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> then inquired
                            how much an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> would cost. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_VNJ1">Von Neumann</persName> said that this
                            was a difficult question to answer, but that he would guess that after
                            several of the missiles had actually been manufactured, the cost would
                            be about $1 million apiece. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said in short, that would be “relatively
                            cheap”, and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_VNJ1">Von Neumann</persName> said
                            yes.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> then inquired of
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_VNJ1">Von Neumann</persName> as to the
                            accuracy characteristics of the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>.
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_VNJ1">Von Neumann</persName> replied, and
                            concluded with a statement that we have no evidence at this point that
                            the Russians actually have a thermonuclear warhead for their ballistic
                            missiles. On the other hand, we must certainly assume that they would
                            have such a warhead in a matter of two or three years.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> then asked
                            whether there was a tremendous gap between the difficulties of making a
                            1500-mile ballistic missile and a 5500-mile missile. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_VNJ1">Von Neumann</persName> replied that it was a
                            matter of extension rather than of difference in kind. Things that
                            looked highly feasible in a 1500-mile missile looked much more difficult
                            when applied to a 5500-mile missile. We know, for example, that every
                            one of the 1500-mile missiles will actually work. Nevertheless the
                            achievement of a 1500[<hi rend="italic">5500</hi>]-mile missile would
                            follow along the same path as would lead to success with a 1500[<hi rend="italic">1500</hi>]-mile missile.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> then raised the
                            domestic political implications of the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program, and pointed out that a lot of questions about
                            this program would inevitably be asked on Capitol Hill. Since this was
                            the case, he believed that it would be wiser to have the directive read
                            that the Secretary of Defense would prosecute the program with all
                            “possible speed” rather than with all “practicable speed”. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> commented that the
                            difference in wording was quite academic so far as <pb xml:id="pg_115" n="115" facs="0139"/>it concerned the actual course of action in the
                            prosecution of the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program. This
                            program was in any event a multi-billion dollar program. For his
                            conservative blood, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName>, that was enough, and he was opposed to
                            providing any stronger basis than already existed for individuals who
                            felt that there were all kinds of other alternative possibilities in the
                            prosecution of the program and wanted another billion or so in order to
                            try out such possibilities. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> emphasized that we would probably not have a
                            real solution to the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> earlier than
                            1959, and again stressed his view that the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> was not “a replacement weapon”. The background of our
                            strategic force, he said, was still the manned aircraft. In adopting the
                            proposed <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> action, the Department of
                            Defense would contemplate a billion-dollar bulge in its budget for the
                            Fiscal Year 1957 or 1958.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President said that as he saw it, the adjective “practicable”
                            meant that you would spend about all the money on this program that you
                            practicably could. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said he believed that the phrase “all
                            practicable speed” was the proper one to use. It was essential that you
                            know what you are spending your money for.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President then pointed out that what he was trying to do in part
                            was to anticipate the domestic political problem to which Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> had just alluded. For this
                            reason, the Vice President said, he would again like to repeat his
                            question as to the meaning of the phrase “all practicable speed”.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> replied that it
                            was a very difficult question to answer. The research people on the
                                <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> project were constantly
                            perceiving marginal possibilities for carrying it through which are not
                            now actually in the program. Beyond these marginal possibilities there
                            were several alternative approaches to the problem. Accordingly, it
                            became very difficult to define the precise meaning of such phrases as
                            “all practicable speed” and “all possible speed”. He said that he rather
                            liked the adjective “practicable”, but the phrase “all possible speed”
                            was not objectionable to him.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> said that he had
                            one comment to make at this point. He explained that he was speaking as
                            an individual with an engineering background, and that he was addressing
                            himself to the problem of the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> in
                            the context of our <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>. If the
                            Soviets were to demonstrate to the world that they actually had an
                                <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> before we had such a weapon,
                            the result would have the most devastating effect on the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> of the United States of
                            anything that could possibly happen. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> pointed out that the Western
                            coalition was held together essentially by the knowledge of the members
                            of the coalition of the ability of the United States to protect them. If
                            this umbrella of protection were removed, neutralism would advance
                            tremendously throughout the free world. From a developmental point of
                            view, continued Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName>, we in the <pb xml:id="pg_116" n="116" facs="0140"/>State Department view the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                            project as in very much the same category as the Manhattan Project
                            during World War II. All possible avenues to success would be tried, and
                            we should not confine ourselves only to those which seemed most likely
                            to produce results. In the State Department it was understood that there
                            were some 180 projects in the Defense Department in the category of
                            “highest priority”. The State Department believed that the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> project should be at the very top of
                            this priority, even if to put it there inevitably meant going down
                            certain unproductive avenues. Accordingly, it seemed to Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> that the difference
                            between the phrases “all practicable speed” and “all possible speed” was
                            not a mere verbal difference, but constituted the very essence of the
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that he
                            still thought that the difference between these two phrases was largely
                            academic. What you actually should do was to spend all the money you
                            could that would be productive of results in achieving this capability.
                            You should follow all reasonable avenues of approach to success.
                            Essentially the difference in the two sets of words was the difference
                            between a sensible approach to a solution of the problem and a crash
                            approach.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> replied by
                            stating that when you absolutely have to get a job done, you have to
                            take something of the shotgun approach. There are a number of very
                            difficult decisions which those who directly manage the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program are obliged to take. In
                            making such decisions these project managers should feel free of
                            restraints. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName>
                            added that he would strongly recommend that we make the most complete
                            use of all our resources to achieve this objective, even if in so doing
                            waste was involved. The stakes were too high to permit any other course
                            of action.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> said he wished
                            strongly to support these views of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName>, and asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> whether he would not agree to
                            the use of the words “all possible speed” provided additional language
                            were inserted as a safeguard—for example, a statement that the
                            Department of Defense would check back with the National Security
                            Council if vast additional sums should be involved.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> did not reply
                            directly to Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>’s
                            inquiry, but himself put the question as to whether the reports by the
                            Department of Defense to the National Security Council on the progress
                            of the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program would not contain
                            cost estimates and therefore act as or constitute a kind of check on
                            it.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> suggested that
                            regardless of the choice of words, whether “all possible speed” or “all
                            practicable speed”, the Science Advisory group should be asked to report
                            to the National Security Council as to whether there were any areas of
                            scientific progress toward the achievement of an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> which were not being adequately <pb xml:id="pg_117" n="117" facs="0141"/>explored in the current <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> believed that reporting such
                            information was much more significant than the issue of the words to be
                            selected.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> said he had yet
                            another observation to make. This was to call the attention of the
                            Council to the fact that the earth satellite exercise had gone a long
                            way to help the peoples of the free world realize that we were forging
                            ahead in our technological capabilities.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName> stated his
                            understanding that the language of the proposed directive, as modified
                            and approved by the President, would produce a situation in which no
                            other project within the Department of Defense would enjoy a priority as
                            high as the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program. As the
                            President understood the proposed <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            action and directive, the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> would
                            certainly not be one of the 180 top priority projects.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President then referred to the letter which Senators <persName corresp="#p_ACP1">Anderson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_JWH1">Jackson</persName> had written to the President,
                            urging a crash program for the achievement of an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>.<note n="7" xml:id="d34fn7">Dated
                                June 30, not printed. (Eisenhower Library, Staff Secretary Records,
                                Atomic Energy–Joint Committee)</note> On this point the Vice
                            President said that when he and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon
                                Anderson</persName> had talked to the President at Denver on
                            September 5, the President had indicated that he did not favor a crash
                            program for the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> of the Manhattan
                            type. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> said that
                            nevertheless we ought to avoid any possibility that the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program should be merely one of 180
                            other top priority programs.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General Twining</persName> observed that no
                            other project within the Air Force had a priority as high as the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>. He said that he was greatly
                            impressed with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_VNJ1">Von Neumann</persName>’s
                            idea of a report to the National Security Council on what avenues of
                            approach to achieving an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> were not
                            actually being explored. He then went on to point out his view that it
                            was essential that all parts of the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program go forward together, so that the end result
                            would be a complete weapon capability with the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> ready to be used. He was therefore opposed to a
                            Manhattan-type project.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> said he now
                            understood that no other project enjoyed so high a priority in the Air
                            Force as did the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>; but would this
                            proposed directive assure that no project throughout the entire
                            Department of Defense would enjoy as high a priority as the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>? Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> replied by stating that the
                                <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> project under this directive
                            would enjoy a special priority and would, alone among all the projects,
                            be given special treatment in the Department of Defense.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_118" n="118" facs="0142"/>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> then suggested
                            that, after the statement that the U.S. <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program is therefore a program of the highest
                            priority, the words “above all others” should be inserted. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> replied that he still
                            preferred the existing language without Governor Stassen’s addition,
                            because the existing language would assure the Defense Department of
                            greater flexibility.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_VNJ1">Von Neumann</persName> commented that the
                            question of these different phrases was more or less academic as far as
                            the National Security Council was concerned. The members of the Council
                            actually knew what was intended by these words. However, the precise
                            choice of words became much more important the further down the line you
                            went and the further you got away from the clear understanding of the
                            words in the National Security Council.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName> then said he
                            thought it desirable to add one or two facts bearing on the domestic
                            political aspects of the problem. He summarized the President’s proposed
                            response to the letter sent him by Senators <persName corresp="#p_ACP1">Anderson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_JWH1">Jackson</persName>. This response would indicate that the President
                            did not like a Manhattan type of project for the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program. The President had expressed
                            the thought that if we went beyond the priority assigned to the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> by the presently proposed <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> action, the result would be to destroy
                            the flexibility which was required by the responsible department and
                            might actually delay development. In sum, the President believed that
                            the language of the present directive went as far as one could go
                            without getting into a panicky or frantic state of mind.<note n="8" xml:id="d34fn8">The President explained this position in a letter to
                                Senator <persName corresp="#p_ACP1">Anderson</persName>, dated
                                September 13. Emphasizing that “the earliest development of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> capability is of vital importance
                                to the security of the United States,” the President stated that
                                “nothing surmountable shall stand in the way of the most rapid
                                progress on this program” and that none of the delays common to
                                normal peacetime development or procurement programs would be
                                tolerated. The President took note of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action, printed below, ensuring that the
                                Departments of Defense and the Air Force would prosecute the program
                                “with all speed,” but he declined to set up an alternative
                                organizational procedure that would involve “lifting this program
                                completely out of the context in which it is established.” Such a
                                step, the President believed, “could and probably would cause the
                                loss of some of the momentum the program has where it is and
                                postpone the date of operational capability.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> then suggested
                            that subparagraph c might be amended to read “The U.S. <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program is therefore a program of the
                            highest priority above all others, except as directed by the
                            President.”</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> said that of
                            course this entire matter had been discussed at the greatest length in
                            the Defense Department. He could assure the Vice President and the
                            National Security Council that the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                            program was enjoying the very highest priority not only in the Air Force
                            but in the entire Defense Department. All internal pressure <pb xml:id="pg_119" n="119" facs="0143"/>will be directed by the
                            Department of Defense along this line, and questions of judgment as to
                            practicability will be answered in terms of this kind of priority.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> said that he not
                            only seconded the suggested revision of subparagraph c made by Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, but would also add
                            the suggestion made earlier that the Department of Defense report to the
                            National Security Council on avenues of approach to the achievement of
                            an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> which were not being currently
                            used in the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> again warned the
                            Council that this whole <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program
                            could flare up into an intensely emotional political issue. Hence, he
                            would resolve all doubts by choosing to use the strongest possible words
                            as to the manner in which the program would be prosecuted. He would
                            therefore still recommend “all possible speed” rather than “all
                            practicable speed” because the use of the term “all possible speed”
                            would expose the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program to all
                            kinds of difficulties.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President said he had been very greatly impressed by Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName>’s earlier argument
                            that the important thing is not merely the achievement of a developed
                            weapons capability in the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> field,
                            but, from the point of view of <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>,
                            that the peoples of the free world believe that you have achieved an
                                <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>. Accordingly, it seemed of the
                            utmost importance to the Vice President that the United States get an
                            experimental <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> missile and not wait
                            for the final and developed weapon which <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General Twining</persName> desired from the military point of
                            view.</p>
                        <p>At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName>
                            placed before the Council the three proposed revisions which had been
                            suggested in the course of the discussion. Before these issues could be
                            decided, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> said
                            he had one more question to put to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_VNJ1">Von
                                Neumann</persName> with respect to the latter’s argument that the
                            language adopted by the Council, while quite clear in its meaning to the
                            Council itself, might be much less clear to those on the firing line who
                            were intimately engaged in the prosecution of the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program. Would the language “to be
                            prosecuted with all possible speed” have a clearer meaning to these
                            people than the term “all practicable speed”? Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> said he believed it would, and
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_VNJ1">Von Neumann</persName> agreed with
                            him.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> then referred
                            to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName>’s earlier
                            reference to the foreign policy aspects of these weapons developments,
                            and raised the question as to the foreign policy implication of the
                            possiblity that the United States would develop a 1500-mile ballistic
                            missile prior to the achievement by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> of a 5500-mile missile. Would prior achievement of a
                            1500-mile missile in effect counter somewhat the achievement by the
                            Russians of a 5500-mile missile <pb xml:id="pg_120" n="120" facs="0144"/>prior to the U.S.? In short, should we make a particular try for the
                            1500-mile missile? Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> thought that some study should be given to the
                            foreign policy implications which he had raised.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> expressed
                            interest in such a proposed study, and pointed out first that most of
                            America’s allies were within the range of a Soviet 1500-mile weapon.
                            Futhermore, he questioned whether our allies would permit us to use
                            overseas bases on their territory from which to launch 1500-mile
                            missiles.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> said there was
                            yet another subject which ought to be studied. Will we not soon have to
                            assume that the Soviets will beat us out in the race to achieve an
                                <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>, and should we not therefore
                            consider what moves we will make if this indeed becomes a fact? Governor
                                <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> then inquired whether
                            the Russians would feel it necessary to make tests of an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> before being assured that they have
                            actually achieved an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> capability.
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_VNJ1">Von Neumann</persName> answered in the
                            affirmative, and said that a number of tests would in all probability be
                            made by the Russians, who thought much as we did with regard to the
                            necessity of tests. He pointed out, however, that the test might be made
                            by sending the missile straight up into the air rather than directing it
                            across a stretch of 5500 miles.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> explained that
                            he was not yet quite clear on this difference between the problems
                            presented by the development of the long-range and the medium-range
                            ballistic missiles. Does work on these two weapons go along together, or
                            do they develop along separate courses? Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> replied that the technology of
                            the long-range weapon was very similar to the technology of the shorter
                            range weapon, if you perfected the technology of the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>, you would be perfecting the
                            technology of the shorter range missile. On the other hand, if you
                            concentrated on the 1500-mile missile you would be likely to get it
                            earlier. <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General Twining</persName> added
                            that of course the British were pushing hard for the development of a
                            1500-mile missile, and we were giving them all the help we could.</p>
                        <p>As Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> was about to sum up the consensus of
                            the Council as to changes in the proposed directive, the Acting Director
                            of the Budget, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName>, said
                            he had one other concern, which had been called to his attention by the
                            Budget member of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning Board.
                            Could the language in subparagraph d of the proposed action, to the
                            effect that “all other Executive departments and agencies will assist
                            the Department of Defense as required”, give the Secretary of Defense
                            authority over other Executive departments and agencies? Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> pointed out that the President
                            was the source of the Secretary of Defense’s authority here, and
                            Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> said that he
                            supposed this language was inserted in order to avoid delays which might
                            be caused by resorting to regular budgetary review. Mr.
                                <persName>Anderson</persName> said that if any dispute arose in this
                            area it would presumably go <pb xml:id="pg_121" n="121" facs="0145"/>to
                            the President to be resolved. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> added that so far as his interpretation was
                            concerned, he believed that this language meant that the <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> would give the requirements of the
                            Secretary of Defense an overriding priority in <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> and would assure the Secretary of Defense that he could
                            get anything from <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> that he
                            required.</p>
                        <p>At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName>
                            presented to the Council the three revisons in the proposed directive
                            which had been suggested in the course of the discussion. The Council
                            decided to revise subparagraph c by inclusion of the words “above all
                            others, except as directed by the President.” It also accepted the
                            amendment to subparagraph d which inserted the phrase “including avenues
                            not explored”. The Council rejected the proposal that the phrase “all
                            practicable speed”, in subparagraph d, be replaced by the phrase “all
                            possible speed”.</p>

                        <p>a. Agreed that:</p>
                        <p>(1) There would be the gravest repercussions on the national security and
                            on the cohesion of the free world, should the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> achieve an operational capability with the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> substantially in advance of the
                            U.S.</p>
                        <p>(2) In view of known Soviet progress in this field, the development by
                            the U.S. of an operational capability with the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> is a matter of great urgency.</p>
                        <p>(3) The U.S. <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program is therefore a
                            program of the highest priority above all others, except as directed by
                            the President.</p>
                        <p>(4) The Secretary of Defense will prosecute the program with all
                            practicable speed, and all other Executive departments and agencies will
                            assist the Department of Defense as required. The Secretary of Defense
                            will report promptly to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> any
                            significant developments or causes of delay in this program (including
                            avenues not explored), and additionally will give the Council a special
                            briefing at least once a year, normally in December, on the status of
                            setting an earlier target date for operational capability and the
                            arguments for and against such a proposal.</p>
                        <p>b. Requested the Department of State to report to the Council, not later
                            than December 1, 1955, on the foreign policy implications of a
                            demonstration by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> that it had
                            developed an intercontinental or a 1500-mile ballistic missile prior to
                            the U.S., and an estimate of the extent to which U.S. achievement of a
                            1500-mile missile would counter the implications of Soviet achievement
                            of an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> or a 1500-mile missile.<note n="10" xml:id="d34fn10">See <ref target="#d34fn5">footnote 5</ref>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. General</p>
                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5501 remains generally valid as an
                            expression of basic national security policy. Although some revision
                            would, in any event, be required to take into account more recent
                            estimates of comparative capabilities and other changes, the basic
                            problem concerns the nature of the change of external climate which has
                            occurred since the approval of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5501
                            and the implications this change holds for the directions of U.S.
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>2. The underlying concepts of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5501
                            were designed for a world situation in which flexibility had just begun
                            to mark Soviet policy, in which the requirements of free world strength
                            and cohesion had begun to shift from safeguards against imminent
                            aggression to preparations for long-term competition, and in which the
                            U.S. had begun to ready itself for the possibility of negotiations with
                            Soviet-Communist power.</p>
                        <p>3. The coming period seems likely to be characterized by decreasing fear
                            of overt Soviet aggression; greater horror of nuclear war; full exercise
                            of Soviet-Communist diplomatic resource; and by prolonged negotiations
                            with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and possibly Communist
                            China.</p>
                        <p>4. The paragraphs which follow raise some of the issues inherent in the
                            new situation. Specific comments of the Department on textual changes in
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5501 will be submitted
                            later.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Estimate of Significant Change in the World
                            Situation</p>
                        <p>5. Current Soviet policy appears to be marked by: (a) a recognition that
                            general war no longer can advance its own national interests; (b) a
                            greater emphasis in its diplomacy on “amiability” and lure than on
                            threat; (c) a possible interest in negotiating on some major problems,
                            such as disarmament; (d) a hardening of their positions on some of the
                            main areas of dispute, such as Germany; (e) the continuing objective to
                            eliminate <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, U.S. overseas bases,
                            and U.S. influence abroad; (f) unclarity as to whether the Soviets view
                            détente as a durable modus vivendi or a short-term modus operandi.</p>
                        <p>6. The free coalitions now seem to regard Soviet military aggression as
                            unlikely and to contemplate general war, if it should occur, with even
                            greater dread. These factors have already had a number of consequences
                            of basic significance for the course of U.S. policy: (a) stronger
                            impulses inside the free world toward neutralism and disengagement; (b)
                            greater reluctance to continue to build up national and coalition
                            military establishments; (c) tendencies toward trusting accommodation;
                            (d) more selfish pursuit of separate national interests and ambitions
                            previously submerged by a sense of common danger.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. Opposing Intentions and Strategy in the New
                            Situation</p>
                        <p>7. In the period ahead, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will
                            achieve advantage if, without curtailing its offensive capabilities,
                            expansionist ambitions, and the internal strait-jacketing of its people,
                            it can impair will and capability to resist in the free world. The U.S.
                            will improve its position if, by maintaining the essentials of free
                            world strength and cohesion, it can create conditions which will induce
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to advance further toward
                            responsible participation in a world order.</p>
                        <p>8. In the period ahead, Soviet strategy is likely to operate primarily
                            against free world unity: seeking to disrupt alliances; promote
                            neutralism; lower political and military vigor; reduce U.S. influence;
                            and isolate the U.S. from its allies and from the uncommitted
                            states.</p>
                        <p>9. U.S. policy will have to seek to create conditions which will (a)
                            thwart the Soviet efforts to disrupt the free world; (b) influence the
                            Soviets, over a period of time, to modify their conduct and to revise
                            their practical goals; (c) encourage them to take measures which will
                            make it more difficult to abandon a peaceful policy; (d) induce them to
                            reduce their military capabilities.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">IV. Elements of National Strategy in the New
                            Situation</p>
                        <p>10. For the pursuit of these objectives, many of our present policies are
                            sound and should be carried out vigorously; others will require
                            modification; and certain new elements will have to be added:</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_125" n="125" facs="0149"/>
                        <p>a. <hi rend="italic">In military policy</hi>, our deterrent to general
                            war must be maintained and our ability to apply force, if needed,
                            flexibly and selectively, must be improved in order to deter Communist
                            moves in vulnerable local situations. In view of the probable reluctance
                            of the free world to maintain present levels of military spending in a
                            prolonged détente, as well as for other reasons, we should vigorously
                            seek mutual reductions in military establishments with the Communists.
                            Agreement on effective disarmament is the only promising approach in
                            affecting the growth of a Soviet capability to imperil the continental
                            U.S.</p>
                        <p>b. <hi rend="italic">In maintaining our alliances</hi>, we shall need
                            additional emphasis on measures for unity and staying power over the
                            next period. We shall have to attempt to replace the cement of fear with
                            new means of cohesion, such as steps toward integration and sound
                            regionalism, and common efforts to use technological advances for
                            peaceful ends. In addition, we shall have to consider ways of adjusting
                            our own positions to a less tightly knit coalition.</p>
                        <p>c. <hi rend="italic">In East-West non-military competition for the
                                underdeveloped areas</hi>, the Soviet-Communist challenge seems
                            likely to intensify and to expand to areas it has hitherto neglected,
                            i.e., the Middle East and the other American Republics. In the Far East,
                            South and Southeast Asia, some of the new states may, however, feel
                            freer to work more closely with the rest of the free world in an
                            atmosphere of détente. The strengthening of the healthy nationalism of
                            those areas and assistance to their governments in achieving stability
                            will be cardinal tasks for U.S. policy. Basic changes in the
                            Soviet-Communist world cannot be expected if its creeping expansionism
                            proceeds unchecked.</p>
                        <p>d. <hi rend="italic">In our economic policy</hi>, both toward our allies
                            and the neutrals, we must place increased stress on fostering growth,

                        <p>e. <hi rend="italic">The expansion of East-West contacts</hi> and the

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> said that the next item on the agenda
                            would be the Net Evaluation Subcommittee’s report which would be
                            presented in the Broadcast Room of the White House. <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> commented that the Net
                            Evaluation report which the Council was about to hear had been much more
                            difficult to prepare than its predecessors. Moreover, it went further
                            into very highly classified intelligence information, although not as
                            far as General George, who had directed the preparation of the report,
                            had wanted to go. <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> also expressed the opinion that the National
                            Security Council directive establishing the Net Evaluation Subcommittee
                            was too broad in its terms. He likewise warned that the Council would be
                            hearing statements made in the course of the forthcoming presentation
                            which he hoped the Council would not accept as altogether factual. Many
                            of the conclusions of the Net Evaluation report would actually be
                            approximations based on certain assumptions. If one changed these
                            assumptions, and it was quite reasonable to do so, one would get
                            different answers. Finally, <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> expressed considerable doubt as to the value of
                            the exercise performed by the Net Evaluation Subcommittee in view of the
                            immense amount of work and the considerable expense involved in the
                            months which were consumed in preparing the report of the Net Evaluation
                            Subcommittee.</p>
                        <p>The Council then moved from the Cabinet Room to the Broadcast Room of the
                            White House.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> opened the discussion on this item,
                            advising that the purpose of the meeting was to hear a briefing on the
                            first annual report by the Council’s Net Evaluation Subcommittee which
                            was established pursuant to a new directive recommended by the Council
                            and approved by the President on February 14, 1955. <note n="3" xml:id="d38fn3">Reference is to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                                5511.</note> He recalled that the directive established a permanent
                            procedure (in the form of a Net Evaluation Subcommittee) to provide
                            integrated evaluations of the net capabilities of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, in the event of general war, to
                            inflict direct injury upon the continental U.S. and U.S. installations
                            overseas, and to provide a continual watch for changes which would
                            significantly <pb xml:id="pg_127" n="127" facs="0151"/>alter those net
                            capabilities. Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> mentioned the makeup of
                            the Subcommittee and the fact that the President had appointed Lieut.
                            General Harold George, <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>, retired,
                            as the Subcommittee’s staff director. Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName>
                            also indicated that in addition to the regular attendants at this
                            Council meeting, there were present for this briefing the members of the
                            Net Evaluation Subcommittee, General George and the members of the
                            Subcommittee staff, and the Planning Board members and advisors. Mr.
                                <persName>Anderson</persName> then called upon <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName>, as Chairman of the
                            Subcommittee, to make any additional comments he deemed appropriate.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> observed that
                            the report the Council was to hear today was an interesting and highly
                            sensitive one. He requested that details of the briefing which was to
                            ensue not be covered further in any debriefing in the several
                            departments and agencies concerned. He indicated that General George has
                            been engaged in intensive work on this project since his appointment by
                            the President last February. He noted that earlier in the week the
                            Subcommittee had heard the briefing which was about to be put on for the
                            Council and that insofar as he, <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName>, knew, the Subcommittee members were in unanimous
                            agreement on the report. <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> indicated that while the individual members of
                            the Subcommittee were responsible for elements of the report falling
                            within their respective jurisdictions, that only the Chairman is
                            responsible for the report as a whole. <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> concluded with the opinion that the
                            Subcommittee staff has done an excellent job, whereupon he called upon
                            the staff director to initiate the briefing.</p>
                        <p>General George outlined in brief the general approach taken by the
                            Subcommittee staff to the implementation of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5511. He indicated that two basic plans were worked by
                            members of the staff who simulated the role of war planners in the
                            Kremlin. In brief, the first plan (Plan A) assumed a Soviet surprise
                            attack on the United States with no strategic warning. The second plan
                            (Plan C) assumed a Soviet attack preceded by sufficient strategic
                            warning to place U.S. military and civil defenses in a condition of full
                            alert in order to initiate U.S. retaliatory action. General George then
                            called upon the Deputy Director of the staff, Major General Gordon B.
                            Rogers, who introduced the following individuals: Colonel Worth Kindred,
                                <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>, and Colonel Edward Herbes,
                                <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>, who gave the briefing on Plan
                            A and on the war-gaming of that plan, including U.S. retaliatory action
                            as well as estimated damage effects resulting from the Soviet attack and
                            the U.S. retaliatory attack.</p>
                        <p>Plan C was thereupon presented, along lines identical to Plan A, by
                            Colonel George W. Criss, <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>, and
                            Captain Frank Turner, <gloss target="#t_USN1">USN</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_128" n="128" facs="0152"/>
                        <p>Next Dr. Ludwell Montague, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, briefed
                            the Council on various aspects of the threat to the United States posed
                            by the clandestine introduction of nuclear weapons by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Criss thereupon briefed the Council on significant variables
                            which could substantially alter the estimates and conclusions reached by
                            the Subcommittee in its war-gaming of Plans A and C. These variables
                            included basic questions as to (a) the size and make-up of the Soviet
                            nuclear stockpile (b) fallout effects (c) the psychological impact upon
                            the populace of large scale nuclear weapons (d) strategic warning and
                            (e) programmed U.S. military posture at the time of attack.</p>
                        <p>The formal briefing was terminated with the presentation of the
                            conclusions reached by the Net Evaluation Subcommittee. These
                            conclusions were presented by Colonel Richard Ross, <gloss target="#t_USMC1">USMC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President, at the suggestion of Mr.
                                <persName>Anderson</persName>, invited the Council members to
                            comment on the briefing and to raise any questions that they might have
                            with the Subcommittee.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> indicated that
                            when the Subcommittee received the briefing by General George’s staff
                            earlier in the week, questions had arisen and were answered at that
                            time. As a consequence, Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> had no questions
                            to put to the Subcommittee today. He wished to mention, however, that
                            all of the member agencies of the Subcommittee did not participate in
                            the war-gaming covered in the formal briefing.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> said he had no
                            questions and he expressed appreciation to General George and his staff
                            for the excellent work performed by them.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President said that he appreciated not only the great effort and
                            many hours which the staff had devoted to this project, but also the
                            excellent and concise manner of presenting their very complicated
                            report. He said that he assumed that the Subcommittee’s evaluations were
                            based on the best evidence available as to the contemplated capabilities
                            of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in 1958 and <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> advised that his
                            assumption was correct.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President then inquired whether the Soviets were aware of our
                            nuclear and delivery capabilities and if not, he wondered whether it
                            would be in the interest of the United States to create such an
                            awareness on the part of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> responded
                            that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> probably had much better
                            intelligence on our nuclear stockpile and delivery capability than we
                            had on theirs. In fact, he said, we publish a considerable amount of
                            information relating to aircraft delivery and fighter capability, all
                            which is readily available to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_129" n="129" facs="0153"/>
                        <p>The Vice President observed that up to a point there could be substantial
                            benefit accruing to the United States if the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> were cognizant of our great nuclear and delivery
                            capability.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President noted that the portion of the briefing which dealt
                            with clandestine attack appeared to be the closest thing to a
                            recommendation made by the Subcommittee and he inquired whether the
                            Subcommittee had further recommendations to make with respect to
                            clandestine attack or to other aspects of the subject. <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> said that the
                            Subcommittee was not asked to make recommendations; that General
                            George’s people had some recommendations but that it was his (<persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName>’s) view that in lieu
                            of Subcommittee recommendations as such, each member of the Subcommittee
                            should suggest any action in his particular area of responsibility which
                            he considers appropriate.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> observed that the
                            evaluations and briefing provided by the Subcommittee are basic to the
                            Council’s thinking on numerous subjects and problems which are
                            constantly arising in the field of national security. He noted that many
                            of these problems are being reexamined regularly by the Council and he
                            expressed the view that today’s briefing would substantially aid the
                            Council in its thinking on such problems as they come up for discussion
                            at future Council meetings.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, observing that
                            it did not appear that the <gloss target="#t_DEW1">DEW</gloss> Line
                            seemed to serve any particular purpose in terms of the attacks
                            contemplated under Plans A and C, asked what value, if any, the <gloss target="#t_DEW1">DEW</gloss> Line seems to have in terms on enemy
                            attack. General George responded that the <gloss target="#t_DEW1">DEW</gloss> Line is of great importance, particularly in terms of a
                            surprise attack such as is envisaged under Plan A, because it would be
                            the one means of alerting for such purposes as getting planes off the
                            ground to meet such an attack.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName> inquired why, in
                            terms of clandestine nuclear introduction, the Mexican Border was not
                            considered just as vulnerable as shipments via the diplomatic pouch or
                            other shipments under diplomatic seal. <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> responded that both means of
                            introduction were considered by the Subcommittee, but time did not allow
                            of the staff going into detail thereon at this particular briefing.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Herbert Hoover</persName> inquired
                            whether the Subcommittee considered in its evaluations the possible use
                            of intercontinental ballistic missiles and General George responded in
                            the negative, stating that such missiles were not deemed to be
                            programmed and operational by the 1958 date used as the basis for the
                            Subcommittee’s studies.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> said that one of
                            the basic questions which remains unanswered at the present is whether
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will have megaton weapons for
                            use by 1958.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_130" n="130" facs="0154"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> inquired whether it
                            would be likely that the Soviets would develop and stockpile such large
                            weapons without testing them and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Foster</persName>, <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>, responded
                            that it is the consensus of atomic energy officials both in the United
                            States and the United Kingdom that it is unlikely that the Soviets would
                            risk the chance of failure which could flow from stockpiling untested
                            high yield thermonuclear weapons.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName>, reverting to the references made
                            earlier in the meeting with respect to clandestine introductions
                            indicated his understanding that a report on the diplomatic pouch
                            problem would be forthcoming from the Council’s internal security
                            committees in the near future. He thought it desirable that the Planning
                            Board consider that report in the light of the report of the Net
                            Evaluation Subcommittee and in the light of the Council’s discussion of
                            the diplomatic pouch problem.<note n="4" xml:id="d38fn4">On December 1,

                        <p>The focus of this estimate is primarily on prospective trends in the
                            global power struggle between the Bloc and the Free World over the next
                            several years. Any such global projection is necessarily highly
                            speculative. Among other things it cannot, as an intelligence estimate,
                            take full account of US policies, which will have a great impact and
                            will doubtless be altered somewhat if only in response to such trends as
                            those projected herein.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. The Current World Situation</p>
                        <p>1. The salient feature of the present global situation is a change in the
                            character of the East-West conflict. Three factors appear to have
                            brought about this change: the growing number and destructiveness of
                            nuclear weapons, the growth of Western strength and unity in response to
                            the postwar Communist threat, and (at least partly as a result) the
                            subsequent shift in Bloc tactics. The change in the external
                            manifestations of Bloc behavior has been extensive, but the activities
                            of the international Soviet network of subversion and espionage continue
                            at a high level, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has made no
                            major concessions of substance, and we see no evidence of any alteration
                            in basic Soviet objectives.</p>
                        <p>2. In the immediate postwar period the Kremlim aimed at capitalizing on
                            the war-weariness of the non-Communist world to consolidate and expand
                            Communist influence and power. To this end, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> generally showed itself under Stalin’s leadership
                            uncompromising in negotiation, abusive in propaganda, and aggressive in
                            action. It was soon joined by Communist China. Eventually, however, the
                            Soviet and Chinese conduct brought forth a vigorous Western reaction,
                            developed under US leadership. Full mobilization of Free World
                            counterstrength was precluded by wide variations among Free World <pb xml:id="pg_132" n="132" facs="0156"/>countries in the degree of
                            their concern over the Communist threat, and by their preoccupation with
                            internal problems, colonial issues, or other disputes. Nevertheless,
                            there was an increasing tendency toward division of the world into two
                            armed and hostile camps.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">The Shift In Soviet Policy</hi>. The increase in
                            Free World will and ability to resist led to narrowing of opportunities
                            for Bloc expansionism and a growing risk that local military aggression
                            would lead to general war, which the Soviet leaders apparently desired
                            to avoid. Faced with a world situation increasingly inhospitable to
                            their aims, the Soviet leaders began to seek a way to restore their
                            maneuverability short of the alternative extremes of war or of
                            accommodation at unacceptable cost. Especially since early 1955, these
                            leaders have become less openly belligerent in their attitudes and have
                            made a series of conciliatory gestures. They ceased the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>’s long standing procrastination on an
                            Austrian peace treaty, indicated apparent willingness to accept some
                            important aspects of the Western position on disarmament, reduced the
                            hostility of their propaganda, and substantially increased Soviet
                            contacts with the West. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> at the
                            “Summit” Conference<note n="2" xml:id="d39fn2">Reference is to the
                                Meeting of the Heads of Government of the United States, the United
                                Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union held at Geneva, July 18–23.
                                See vol. v, pp. 119 ff.</note> and since has sought more or less
                            consistently to convince the Free World that is is possible to establish
                            conditions of “mutual trust.”</p>
                        <p>4. A complex of factors probably shaped the new Soviet policy. The
                            immediate impetus was probably supplied by the prospective rearmament of
                            West Germany, which appeared to be finally confirmed by the ratification
                            of the Paris Accords in February 1955. However, influencing in a more
                            general way all Soviet policy considerations must be a realization of
                            the destructive power of nuclear weapons and the fact that at present US
                            nuclear capabilities greatly exceed those of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. At least as long as this gap exists
                            the Soviet leaders will almost certainly wish to minimize the risks of
                            general war. Also in the background of Soviet policy-making may be the
                            mounting economic burden of the military establishment, especially
                            manifest in the increasing costs of new weapons systems. Further large
                            annual increases in military expenditures would in time force the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to pay a price in reduction of the
                            high rate of economic growth which has always been a basic Soviet aim.
                            The Soviet leaders may believe that a period of relaxed international
                            tensions would permit spreading the increasing cost of their military
                            establishment over a longer period of time.</p>
                        <p>5. The death of Stalin was probably also a factor since it allowed his
                            successors to exercise greater flexibility. The collective nature of the
                            new leadership probably made it more responsive to the variety of <pb xml:id="pg_133" n="133" facs="0157"/>pressures pointing toward a new
                            policy. Finally, the new Soviet leaders probably concluded that a
                            reduction in international tensions, if achieved, would promote the
                            opening of rifts in the Western coalition, bring about a decline in the
                            Western defense effort, and thus offer profitable new opportunities for
                            Communist political action.<note n="3" xml:id="d39fn3">[<hi rend="italic">Footnote in the source text not

                        </p>
                        <p>6. But while the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> clearly desires a
                            less tense relationship with the Western Powers, it apparently seeks to
                            achieve this on the basis of the territorial status quo, at least in
                            Europe, and without any settlements which would impair the Soviet power
                            position. The Soviet leaders have been intransigeant on Germany, and
                            have rejected even discussion of the status of the European Satellites
                            or of international Communism. The Free and Communist Worlds are still
                            far apart on main issues, except possibly on some phases of the
                            disarmament questions.</p>
                        <p>7. Communist China has adopted a course generally similar to that of the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. At the Bandung
                                Conference<note n="4" xml:id="d39fn4">Reference is to the Afro-Asian
                                Conference held at Bandung, April 18–24. See vol. XXI, pp. 81
                                ff.</note> Peiping stepped up its policy of wooing its fellow Asian
                            states. While steadily reinforcing its military threat in the Taiwan
                            Strait area and firmly reiterating its claims to Taiwan, Peiping also
                            apparently believes that for the present it is necessary to move toward
                            its objectives by political action.</p>
                        <p>8. Meanwhile, Peiping and Moscow are turning to a new cold war offensive,
                            involving for the first time the use of military and economic aid to
                            non-Communist countries. Particularly notable is their new emphasis on
                            the highly vulnerable areas of South Asia and the Middle East. The Bloc
                            is offering expanded trade and economic and technical assistance, often
                            on highly favorable terms, to a numbers of countries. Most recently it
                            has made arms available to Egypt and is offering them to Syria and Saudi
                            Arabia as well as to Austria and Finland.</p>
                        <p>9. <hi rend="italic">The Free World Reaction</hi>. The Free World’s
                            reaction to the shift in Bloc policy must be considered against the
                            background of growing concern over the devastating consequences of
                            all-out nuclear war. The most important effect of growing nuclear
                            capabilities is to diminish the willingness of most governments and
                            peoples to incur risks of war. This has led in turn to growing public
                            pressures for a reduction of cold war tensions, for negotiations toward
                            East-West settlements, and for some form of disarmament.</p>
                        <p>10. Against this background the shift in Bloc conduct has already had a
                            marked impact on the non-Communist world. It has inspired widespread
                            belief that the likelihood of general war has lessened, and hope that a
                            lasting East-West détente can be arranged. This atmosphere has also
                            reduced the incentive for Free World countries to submerge <pb xml:id="pg_134" n="134" facs="0158"/>their differences in the face
                            of a common threat; such disputes as that over Cyprus have taken on
                            extra intensity. Throughout the Free World, there is greater willingness
                            to accept Soviet offers of trade and aid and to normalize relations with
                            the Bloc. Austria has accepted a policy of neutrality, and Yugoslavia
                            has opted for a flexible “middle position” between East and West. Egypt
                            and other Arab states are receptive to Bloc arms aid, which aggravates
                            the explosive Arab-Israeli situation.</p>
                        <p>11. Meanwhile nationalist agitation in the remaining colonial areas
                            continues to create frictions between the European powers and their
                            former dependencies in Asia, and even among the Western Powers
                            themselves. [<hi rend="italic">1 sentence (22 words) not

                            Economic Power</p>
                        <p>12. The coming period will almost certainly be characterized by a
                            continuing build-up of Bloc economic strength and, except possibly in
                            the event of effective arms limitations, of Bloc military capabilities.
                            There is no indication that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            and Communist China are likely to abandon their objective of rapidly
                            narrowing the gaps between their own and Western power. Though the
                            economies of the Western countries remain subject to considerable
                            fluctuation, they at present appear likely to continue a high level of
                            activity. But whether the West would be willing to maintain prudent
                            military strength in the event of a protracted reduction of tensions is
                            uncertain.</p>
                        <p>13. <hi rend="italic">Trends in Military Balance of Power.</hi> Although
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> already has substantial
                            nuclear warfare capabilities, it is unlikely at least until mid-1958 to
                            acquire such capabilities sufficient either to neutralize US retaliatory
                            power or to inflict decisive damage on the US. During this time,
                            therefore, the US will retain a substantial advantage over the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in nuclear warfare capabilities.</p>
                        <p>14. However, Soviet delivery capabilities are growing steadily, the size
                            and flexibility of the Soviet weapons stockpile are increasing, and the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> probably will begin acquiring
                            multi-megaton weapons during the next few years. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> also appears to be broadening its
                            strategic concepts to give greater emphasis to the twin factors of
                            surprise and long-range nuclear attack and to be adapting its forces in
                            this direction. At some time after mid-1958, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will almost certainly have acquired a
                            greatly increased capability for nuclear warfare against the US and the
                            relative advantage of the US in this respect will have greatly
                            decreased. Moreover, Soviet capabilities in guided missiles are believed
                            to be growing rapidly. For example, at some time during the 1960–1965
                            period the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> (as well as the US)
                            probably will acquire militarily significant quantities of
                            intercontinental ballistic missiles.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_135" n="135" facs="0159"/>
                        <p>15. Thus a situation is approaching in which a total war involving use by
                            both sides of available nuclear weapons could bring about such extensive
                            destruction as to threaten the survival of both Western civilization and
                            the Soviet system. This might result in a condition of mutual
                            deterrence, in which each side would be strongly inhibited from
                            deliberately initiating general war or taking actions which it regarded
                            as materially increasing the risk of general war. However, general war
                            would remain a possibility, if only because of the element of
                            miscalculation by either side. Local wars might become more likely than
                            at present, since the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>’s growing
                            nuclear capabilities might lead it to calculate that increasing US and
                            allied unwillingness to initiate nuclear war would permit Soviet local
                            aggression without substantial risk of general war.</p>
                        <p>16. General war would also be a possibility in the event that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, either because of an unexpected
                            technological breakthrough or for other reasons, came to believe it
                            could destroy the US without effective retaliation. In an era of rapid
                            technological development it is always possible that a condition of
                            nuclear stalemate may prove transitory. Much may depend upon which side
                            can acquire or maintain technological superiority, in turn largely a
                            function of the application of trained scientific and technical
                            manpower. Though the present scientific assets of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> are less than those of the US (and
                            those of the Bloc as a whole far smaller than those of the West), the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> almost certainly is increasing
                            its scientific assets more rapidly than is the US.</p>
                        <p>17. Although the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is rapidly
                            developing its nuclear striking power it and the Bloc as a whole are
                            also making major efforts to re-equip and reorganize their conventional
                            forces. The Bloc may somewhat reduce the over-all personnel strength of
                            its forces, but these forces are being intensively modernized and their
                            capabilities are steadily improving. In the Far East, Communist China is
                            rapidly developing formidable military strength, though it remains
                            substantially dependent on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for
                            equipment and logistic support.</p>
                        <p>18. The Western coalition retains a potential for further substantial
                            increase in its military strength. However, the realization of this
                            potential depends upon Western will to do so, a will which even now does
                            not appear to be strong, and which would probably decline markedly in a
                            period of reduced tensions.</p>
                        <p>19. <hi rend="italic">Trends in Comparative Economic Strength.</hi> The
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> gives every sign of continuing
                            its intensive economic expansion, notably in heavy industry. The Soviet
                            economy still faces numerous problems, particularly in the fields of
                            agriculture, industrial productivity, and allocation of manpower. Over
                            the long run the rate of economic growth will depend partly on the scale
                            of military effort the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> decides to
                            support. The previous rapid rate of Soviet economic growth <pb xml:id="pg_136" n="136" facs="0160"/>will continue to decline;
                            nevertheless, this rate is likely to remain substantially higher than
                            that of the US. In broad terms we estimate that Soviet <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> (in 1954 little over one-third that of
                            the US) will increase by 1965 to somewhat under half that of the US. But
                            the US economy will probably continue to draw ahead in absolute terms,
                            the gap in <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> increasing from an
                            estimated $228 billion in 1954 to around $294 billion in 1965. On the
                            other hand, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will probably
                            continue to devote a much higher proportion of its resources to
                            investment and military use than will the US. Because of the increasing
                            importance of forces-in-being in an age of nuclear weapons, economic and
                            industrial strength is becoming a less dependable measure of national
                            military power than in past years.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Trends in Bloc Stability and Cohesion</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>20. Over the next several years at least it seems unlikely that the
                            nature of the Soviet political system will significantly change or the
                            stability of the regime be seriously weakened. Maneuvering for power
                            among the present collective leadership will probably continue but it is
                            likely to be confined to the small group at the top and not to result in
                            open violence involving the police or armed forces. Despite the
                            continued existence of major problems such as those in agriculture, and
                            possible future requirements for increases in consumer goods, we see
                            little likelihood of any early development of internal pressures so
                            great as to compel a basic alteration of Soviet policies. Soviet efforts
                            to reduce international tensions appear to have been received with
                            relief and approval by the Soviet people.</p>
                        <p>21. In the European Satellites the post-Stalin leadership is attempting
                            to modify the more obvious manifestations of Soviet control, and may
                            proceed further on this course. However, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> almost certainly will not abandon its hold over the
                            Satellites, nor is it likely that any upsurge of Satellite nationalism
                            will seriously shake this hold. The Satellite regimes share a common
                            interest with Moscow in maintaining tight Communist control over
                            populations which are still basically hostile. A prolonged reduction of
                            tensions would accelerate the already evident decline of popular hope
                            for liberation, and hasten the process of adjustment to Communist
                            rule.</p>
                        <p>22. Though the Peiping regime faces internal problems much greater than
                            those of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, its control over the
                            people is becoming increasingly firm. Meanwhile Communist China’s
                            prestige and influence within and outside the Bloc are growing, and the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will remain careful to treat
                            it as a partner. Latent conflicts of interest between the two powers may
                            eventually come to the fore, but ideological ties, China’s need for
                            industrial and military aid, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>’s
                            interest <pb xml:id="pg_137" n="137" facs="0161"/>in a strong Communist
                            power base in the Far East, common fear of US power, and common interest
                            in the extension of Communist power will probably continue to dictate a
                            close alliance for some years to come.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Major Trends in Soviet and Chinese Communist

                        </p>
                        <p>23. Despite the pronounced change in Soviet tactics, we see no indication
                            that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has given up its
                            long-range aim of achieving a Communist-dominated world. Indeed the new
                            Soviet leaders exhibit an air of confidence in their growing economic
                            and military strength and in the ultimate victory of Communism. What
                            they apparently have decided is that the existing world situation
                            requires a shift from their previous line if they are to make progress
                            toward their ultimate aims. Thus the East-West conflict is merely
                            shifting from a phase marked by direct Bloc threats and pressures to one
                            marked by increasing emphasis on less obvious forms of Communist
                            political warfare.</p>
                        <p>24. The Soviet policy of seeking a general easing of cold war tensions
                            seems pointed toward three main objectives: (a) reducing the threat of
                            nuclear conflict arising from continued tensions, particularly during
                            the period of Soviet nuclear inferiority; (b) gaining time to continue
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>’s military build-up and to
                            deal with its economic problems; and (c) opening new opportunities for
                            undermining Western strength and extending Communist penetration of the
                            Free World. In attempting to undermine Western strength the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will concentrate on neutralizing US
                            nuclear power, inducing a reduction in Free World military forces,
                            isolating the US, and bringing about its withdrawal from Western Europe
                            and from bases around the Bloc. Integral to this objective is the aim of
                            postponing and minimizing the rearmament of West Germany and Japan and
                            if possible weaning away such potentially powerful US allies.</p>
                        <p>25. Communist China will find it difficult to adopt as flexible and
                            amicable a pose as has the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. It is
                            still dominated by unrealized territorial claims, revolutionary fervor,
                            and strong nationalism and anti-Westernism. Nevertheless, for some time
                            it probably will also see advantages in conforming to over-all Soviet
                            policy. Among such advantages would be a relaxation of East-West trade
                            controls and a greater likelihood of achieving UN membership. Peiping
                            appears increasingly disposed to concentrate on creation of a strong
                            Communist power center. It will probably attempt, through subversive
                            penetration and diplomatic negotiation, to weaken hostile power on its
                            periphery and to create new opportunities for expanding its influence
                            without risking a military showdown with the US. Peiping remains
                            determined to eliminate the Nationalist government as unfinished
                            business of the revolution.</p>

                            neither Peiping nor Moscow is likely to undertake or sponsor any local
                            aggression which in their judgment would involve appreciable risk of
                            general war. If the weakness of non-Communist positions in Indochina,
                            Taiwan, or other areas appeared to offer opportunities which they
                            estimated would involve minimal risks of effective counteraction and
                            which could be localized, they might instigate or undertake local
                            aggression. But as long as they pursue their present policy they would
                            carefully weigh whether such a move would vitiate their over-all
                            attempts at reducing tensions.</p>

                            more likely than overt military aggression are continued Communist
                            efforts at penetration and subversion in vulnerable areas, designed to
                            create eventual “revolutions” from within. However, except possibly in
                            Southeast Asia, the more overt forms of subversion are likely to be
                            soft-pedalled, at least in the short run, in favor of subtler forms of
                            political action such as efforts to entice non-Communist parties into
                            popular fronts, to promote neutralist policies, and in general to
                            substitute Bloc for Western influence.</p>
                        <p>28. At the same time the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                            Communist China will probably re-emphasize their desire to negotiate,
                            but they are unlikely to make any major concessions on key issues such
                            as Taiwan or Germany. Nevertheless, they may demonstrate considerable
                            flexibility in other fields. It is possible, for example, that the Bloc
                            might make various arms reductions or undertake additional or even
                            complete withdrawals of nonindigenous Communist forces from areas like
                            North Korea or even from some areas in Europe, if they estimated they
                            could thereby create pressures for substantial Western concessions in
                            return.</p>
                        <p>29. In Europe, the short-term Soviet aim appears to be a general détente
                            based on the status quo, which would legitimize all the Satellite
                            regimes, including that of East Germany. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> appears determined not to accept German reunification
                            unless the European situation is so altered as to insure that a reunited

                            advancing their all-European security proposals, the Soviet leaders aim
                            to undermine <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and bring about a

                        <p>30. In the Middle and Far East the Communists will step up their current
                            campaign against Western efforts to build defensive strength and
                            alliances. They will seek to play on nationalist and anticolonial
                            sentiments and to encourage divisive conflicts. By further offers of
                            increased trade and of economic and military assistance, Moscow and <pb xml:id="pg_139" n="139" facs="0163"/>Peiping will take advantage of
                            the demands of the underdeveloped countries for external aid. Their aims
                            will be to promote neutralism, undermine Western influence, and create
                            subversive assets.</p>
                        <p>31. <hi rend="italic">Soviet Policy toward Disarmament.</hi> At present
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> probably hopes to obtain some
                            form of arms limitation which would greatly reduce the risk of surprise
                            nuclear attack and all-out nuclear warfare. Such a development would
                            minimize the gravest threat to Soviet security while leaving the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in a position to pursue its
                            long-range aims by political action, or even to resume overt
                            expansionism, without incurring unacceptable nuclear risks. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> may also desire some lessening of its
                            present arms burdens in order to permit greater allocation of resources
                            to agricultural and other economic uses.</p>
                        <p>32. Therefore, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> probably aims to
                            commit the West to fixed levels of reduced armament and to limit Western
                            freedom to employ nuclear weapons, but without agreeing to unrestricted
                            inspection. To achieve these gains, the Soviet leaders will probably be
                            willing to agree to similar restrictions, and to accept some limited
                            form of inspection. Meanwhile, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            will hope, through agitation of the disarmament issue, to divide Western
                            opinion, to encourage a relaxation of military effort in the West, and
                            to induce a withdrawal of US forces from overseas areas.</p>
                        <p>33. <hi rend="italic">Probable Duration of Current Phase of Soviet
                                Policy.</hi> Although Soviet policy has shown itself capable of
                            sudden reversal, which could again occur if the present policy failed to
                            achieve its expected results or led to developments prejudicial to
                            Soviet interests, our assessment of Soviet motivations leads us to
                            believe that the Soviet leaders intend to persist in their present
                            course for some time. The care which they have taken to publicize it
                            within the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, thus encouraging
                            popular expectations of relaxed international tensions, also suggests
                            that they do not intend to abandon this new tactic in the near future.
                            The new line of Soviet policy does not, of course, rule out the
                            occurrence of various Communist-incited crises and disturbances in the
                            world, which may even lead to appreciable losses in Western positions.
                            We believe, however, that the Bloc will take care that no one of these
                            is of such magnitude or importance as to return the world to conditions
                            of tension comparable to those existing in the years around 1950.</p>
                        <p>34. The Soviet leaders may nevertheless regard the present phase as only
                            an interim one, to be used to narrow the gap between their own and US
                            nuclear capabilities and to soften up the Free World. Once they had
                            achieved an adequate nuclear capability and possibly created new
                            revolutionary opportunities, or if it became evident that their policy
                            was not producing substantial successes, they might again adopt a more
                            aggressive policy, believing that in any resulting crisis <pb xml:id="pg_140" n="140" facs="0164"/>they could outbluff the West.
                            However, such a reversion would depend in great measure on the Bloc’s
                            estimate of Free World will and deterrent strength.</p>
                        <p>35. Provided that the US and its allies maintain adequte deterrent
                            strength, it remains unlikely that the Bloc would deliberately initiate
                            general nuclear war or local aggression seriously risking this outcome.
                            Even if the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> vastly increased its
                            nuclear capabilities, barring a technological breakthrough it still
                            could not be confident that even a maximum surprise attack would prevent
                            retaliatory devastation of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.
                            The Soviet leaders may be coming to feel that nuclear war in an age of
                            super-weapons involves unacceptable risks and that therefore they must
                            pursue their ultimate objectives by means which minimize the danger of
                            nuclear war.</p>
                        <p>36. An extended period of reduced international tensions and wider
                            East-West contacts would present problems for the Bloc as well as the
                            West. The relaxation of harsh police controls may be difficult to
                            reverse, and the promise of higher standards of living may be difficult
                            to abandon. If a change in Soviet foreign policy required reversion to a
                            policy of sacrifices enforced by drastic controls, internal discontent
                            would result, although it could almost certainly be kept in check.</p>
                        <p>37. However, a relaxation of domestic controls and of the atmosphere of
                            hostility in East-West relations could, if continued over the much
                            longer run, combine with other factors to create real problems for the
                            leaders in the Kremlin. There are signs that industrialization,
                            urbanization, and the system of mass education have produced a
                            bureaucratic and managerial group which might become increasingly
                            devoted to the preservation of its privileges and vested interests and
                            less willing to risk these to advance the cause of world Communism. If
                            current Soviet policy is not reversed it is conceivable that such
                            developments might reach significant proportions over a very long period
                            and might ultimately create pressures for change within the Bloc,
                            particularly in the event that the actions of the Free World prevent
                            Communist victories. Of course if the hard Communist core in the Kremlin
                            foresaw that such developments would threaten their control, they would
                            probably attempt to reverse the trend by force and repression. <note n="5" xml:id="d39fn5">The Deputy Director for Intelligence, The

                                conceivable over the much longer run, would nevertheless omit this
                                paragraph. Viewed in the light of an absence of evidence and of this

                                the next several years. [Footnote in the source text.]</note>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">IV Prospective Trends in the Free World</p>
                        <p>38. So long as the Bloc maintains its present course, a period of
                            apparent stabilization in Bloc–Free World relations will probably exist.
                            It will be marked by reduced fears of Bloc military aggression in the
                            context of prolonged East-West negotiations and of increased diplomatic,
                            economic, and cultural contacts. To most of the nations of the Free
                            World, the course of international events will seem to be dominated less
                            than before by action and counteraction in an East-West struggle. They
                            will therefore feel more free to concentrate on internal problems and on
                            pursuit of their separate national interests.</p>
                        <p>39. While a less strained international atmosphere would reduce the sense
                            of commom danger which has bound many Free World countries, it might
                            also facilitate greater economic and social progress in many areas, as
                            countries tend to concentrate more on these matters. Increased
                            international trade would probably develop. If the Free World should be
                            thus strengthened, and if the Free World maintained adequate military
                            strength, Bloc opportunities for subversive or expansionist gain would
                            probably be narrowed.</p>
                        <p>40. But there is also grave danger that the Bloc’s new policy, together
                            with the increasing recognition of the consequences of nuclear war, will
                            create an even more serious threat to the Free World than did Stalin’s
                            aggressive postwar policies. The US and its allies probably now are
                            confronted by a period of less obvious hostility, harder to identify as
                            such or to meet by such means as deterrent forces or military alliances.
                            While critical threats will still exist in such vulnerable areas as the
                            Taiwan Strait and Indochina, the new phase of the East-West
                            conflict—provided it lasts for any period—may be characterized more by
                            gradual erosion of Free World positions than by acute crises. Adjustment
                            to this new situation is likely to present serious problems to the
                            West.</p>
                        <p>41. The Bloc will not be able easily to overcome all the fear and
                            suspicion created by its past actions. Cautious attitudes on the part of
                            many Free World governments will continue and Bloc intransigeance on
                            major issues would diminish somewhat the impact of its studied
                            amicability. Nonetheless, the new Bloc behavior will accentuate already
                            evident Free World tendencies to make concessions in order to arrive at
                            acceptable settlements with the Bloc. For example, strong support
                            already exists for a shift in Western policies toward Communist China.
                            Very strong pressures are also developing for greatly expanded East-West
                            trade, even in presently controlled items.</p>
                        <p>42. The continued growth of Bloc and Western nuclear capabilities will
                            further stimulate tendencies toward accommodation in non-Communist
                            countries. This factor will be especially important in Western <pb xml:id="pg_142" n="142" facs="0166"/>Europe and Japan. Even wide
                            recognition that the US will for a few years retain a significant
                            nuclear advantage over the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will
                            not overcome these tendencies.</p>
                        <p>43. There is likely to be strong popular pressure upon the governments of
                            non-Communist countries for an agreed reduction in armaments,
                            particularly to reduce the risk of nuclear war. However, the allies of
                            the US will probably be cautious about urging any arms limitations which
                            would neutralize US nuclear deterrent power without full guarantees of
                            comparable restrictions on Soviet power.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Trends in the Western Alliances</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>44. Great difficulty will be encountered in maintaining military
                            deterrent strength and in preserving the cohesion of the Western
                            alliance systems. If the threat of Bloc aggression appears to diminish
                            some loosening of these alliances seems inevitable; in any event their
                            further extension will prove exceedingly difficult. European <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> force levels probably will decline;
                            West German rearmament (likely to be even slower than now planned) will
                            probably be insufficient to compensate for lower arms outlays in other
                            countries, for the probable continued diversion of French forces to
                            North Africa, and for the lack of cohesion in the Balkan alliance.
                            Greater strains will probably develop among some allied countries. Far
                            East issues will almost certainly create further frictions, expecially
                            as crises recur in the Far East where the interests of the European
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies are becoming less
                            engaged. Further intra-<gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> strains
                            will probably also develop over divisive issues such as Cyprus, the
                            Saar, and North Africa.</p>
                        <p>45. Nevertheless, we do not foresee any developments over the next
                            several years which will cause the disintegration of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The interest of the European members
                            in US economic and security commitments will almost certainly dictate
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>’s preservation. We do not
                            believe that even the advent of nuclear plenty would lead most allies of
                            the US, especially the major ones, to abandon their alliances,
                            particularly since they recognize the vital importance of being under
                            the umbrella of US deterrent power. However, in event of a major crisis
                            involving imminent danger of nuclear war, the internal strains which
                            most <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members would experience make
                            it impossible to predict their behavior.</p>
                        <p>46. Another major threat to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            structure may in time develop from increasing West German restiveness
                            over reunification. The present government is firmly attached to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and, in the short term at least,
                            security preoccupations will remain an overriding bar to any German deal
                            with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. But if reduced tensions
                            continued for a long time and the West Germans came to believe that the
                            Soviet <pb xml:id="pg_143" n="143" facs="0167"/>threat to their security
                            had materially lessened, mounting frustration might lead them to seek
                            reunification at the price of abandoning <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>47. Japan, because of its security and economic needs, will probably
                            remain basically aligned with the US. But it will assert progressively
                            greater independence of the US, while normalizing relations with the
                            Bloc. Japan’s serious political and economic problems make it unlikely
                            that it will develop sufficient power and prestige over the next decade
                            to play a major role as a leader of the non-Communist Far East, though
                            its contribution to Free World power in this area should gradually
                            increase.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Trends in the Uncommitted and Underdeveloped
                                Areas</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>48. In a situation of reduced tensions, the problems created by the
                            emergence in the Middle East, Far East, and in Africa of a growing
                            number of underdeveloped and, in many cases, uncommitted countries will
                            assume increasing prominence. Western colonial rule is rapidly
                            disappearing in Asia, and a similar development is already accelerating
                            in Africa; in both areas rising nationalist pressures will continue to
                            weaken remaining European rule. The hallmark of all the emergent nations
                            is a determination to be free of undue foreign influence coupled with an
                            often conflicting desire to create strong modern states. To the extent
                            that they see a reduced threat to them from Communist expansionism,
                            their existing tendencies toward neutralism will be reinforced. At the
                            same time, they require and are actively seeking outside aid in their
                            development. Western failure at least partially to meet their demands
                            may make them increasingly receptive to offers of Bloc aid. Similarly,
                            Western failure to recognize and adjust to the anticolonial and in some
                            cases racial sentiments in these areas would stimulate existing
                            antagonisms.</p>
                        <p>49. Meanwhile the political instability and economic backwardness of the
                            less developed countries of Asia and Africa will continue to be a major
                            source of weakness in the Free World. Those in peripheral areas under
                            the shadow of Communist power remain vulnerable to direct Communist
                            pressures and intervention, as in most of mainland Southeast Asia. South
                            Vietnam and Laos in particular, though they are making slow progress
                            toward viability, are still critically weak and face such a serious
                            internal and external subversive threat as to make their position
                            extremely precarious.</p>
                        <p>50. The situation in the Middle East and South Asia makes these areas
                            dangerously susceptible to Bloc exploitation, particularly to the Bloc’s
                            new campaign of declared peaceful intent, broadened relations, and
                            offers of arms and of expanded trade and aid. The existence of such
                            disputes as the Arab-Israeli conflict and the differences between <pb xml:id="pg_144" n="144" facs="0168"/>India, Pakistan, and
                            Afghanistan facilitate Soviet efforts to disturb area stability and
                            substitute its own for Western influence. Many of these countries will
                            be willing to play off the Bloc against the West.</p>
                        <p>51. In these areas the “battle of ideas” for influencing the attitudes
                            and allegiance of potential leadership groups will also prove
                            increasingly important. The current Bloc effort to establish its
                            international respectability will help open new lines of communication
                            to these groups, particularly those on which the Communists concentrate,
                            the intelligentsia and the youth.</p>
                        <p>52. But the situation in the underdeveloped and largely uncommitted areas
                            will present opportunities as well as risks for the West. In the contest
                            between the Bloc and the West for influence in the areas, the West has
                            great assets. Its capacity for economic and technical aid is far greater
                            than that of the Bloc. In view of the way in which the prospective
                            peaceful uses of atomic energy have caught the world’s imagination, US
                            policies in this field will be of great importance. Moreover, the force
                            of emergent nationalism in Asia and Africa, which has initially
                            manifested itself in anticolonial sentiment and in conflicts with
                            certain of the Western Powers, may prove in time to be an increasing
                            counterforce to Communist penetration. In addition, conflicts of
                            interest like those which potentially exist between India and Communist
                            China may become a considerable force on the Western side. The speed of
                            industrialization and of improvement in living standards achieved
                            respectively in India and in Communist China may come to be regarded in
                            some Asian countries as a test of whether totalitarian or
                            non-totalitarian methods are best suited for pursuing their own economic
                            growth.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">General Trends</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>53. One of the most dangerous political trends over the next several
                            years will probably be a futher blurring of the lines which have divided
                            the Communist and non-Communist worlds. Many Free World countries
                            embarked on a policy of defensive alliances less because of ideological
                            convictions than because of the danger of general war or Bloc local
                            aggression. The apparent abatement of this danger, if the Bloc persists
                            in a convincing demonstration of peaceful intent, may result in
                            increasing neutralism and a trend toward a greater number of uncommitted
                            states.</p>
                        <p>54. These trends will be reflected in the United Nations, which may
                            increase in importance as a forum for attempts to reconcile diverse
                            interests in a period of decreased emphasis on East-West conflict. The
                            US is already becoming less able to count on strong UN majorities for
                            positions which it wishes to espouse; the Latin American countries, for
                            example, may take more independent positions.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_145" n="145" facs="0169"/>
                        <p>55. A trend may also emerge toward new groupings independent of both the
                            West and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Afro-Asian ties will
                            assume increasing importance, though the loose Afro-Asian group in the
                            UN seems too diverse to serve as a base for anything other than
                            advancement of certain common interests, particularly on colonial
                            issues. Though India will remain preoccupied with a host of pressing
                            internal problems, its international influence will probably continue to
                            grow and it may serve as the focus for a loosely coordinated group of
                            nations.</p>
                        <p>56. If the Bloc is heavy-handed in its policies, engages in patently
                            subversive efforts, or reverts to local aggression, the impact of its
                            present line would be offset and many non-Communist states again
                            alienated. On the other hand, if the Bloc maintains an ostensibly
                            peaceful posture over an extended period, the opportunities for the
                            extension of Communist influence may be greatly improved. Local
                            Communist parties may be more able to obscure their objectives and their
                            international affiliations and to play an ostensibly normal role in the
                            political life of Free World nations. Real danger would exist that
                            piecemeal Communist “peaceful gains” in various areas would not be
                            recognized as threatening, and Free World opposition to such moves might
                            become greatly weakened.</p>

                                <persName>Anderson</persName> indicated that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> wished to make a statement.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> stated that the
                            various recent reports and recommendations, such as those of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> Committee, were
                            putting a very expensive load on the budget of the Defense Department.
                            This underlined the necessity of evaluating, first, how much money we
                            can appropriately spend on the defense of the United States and, second,
                            how to determine the correct allocation of funds between the
                            requirements of the offense and the requirements of the defense. It
                            might come, he added, as a considerable shock to the members of the
                            National Security Council to learn that, according to the unilateral
                            estimates of the Services, it would cost approximately $45 billion a
                            year for some years if the Defense Department were to carry out the
                            recommendations of the <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName>
                            Committee together with the regular military and military assistance
                            programs.</p>
                        <p>All this, continued Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, would provide the National Security Council with
                            some idea of the great difficulty which he was encountering in
                            attempting to determine the over-all figure for the Defense budget for
                            the Fiscal Year 1957. He wondered whether the Council would consider a
                            figure of $38.5 billion as a reasonable ceiling for the Fiscal Year
                            1957. Actually, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>
                            said that he was presenting to the Services the figure of $34 billion,
                            but it could be safely anticipated that there would be vigorous protests
                            on it. In any case, when the Council talked about the various programs
                            recommended by the <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName>
                            Committee, it should be better aware of the problem posed by the costs
                            of implementing these programs. Certainly every effort must be made to
                            try to establish some priorities among all these conflicting programs.
                            On the one hand, it was impossible to disregard the factor of costs. On
                            the other hand, it was likewise difficult to determine a certain top
                            figure and then simply tell the Services to carry out what programs they
                            could while keeping within the figure selected. In addition to all this,
                            there was the problem of ever-increasing costs. Steel was up $7 a ton
                            over last year.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> pointed out to
                            the Council that in point of fact the Defense Department had established
                            some priorities based upon agreed national policies. The difficulty was
                            that these papers gave rise to directives to the military services, and
                            they felt obligated to carry out these directives, though sometimes, as
                            in the case of the Distant Early Warning (<gloss target="#t_DEW1">DEW</gloss>) Line, the costs of carrying out these directives were
                            greater than anticipated.</p>
                        <p>At this point the Vice President called on the Acting Director of the
                            Budget. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> stated that
                            the Administration seemed to encounter very great trouble in putting an
                            end to old projects and programs when it got into new projects and
                            programs. This was true not only in the area of national defense and
                            foreign policy. It was likewise true of the whole range of domestic
                            programs. Although much that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said seemed to be correct, the fact remained that
                            there was no priority “on stopping things”.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> then said that he
                            wished to be heard on this subject. He first reminded the Council of the
                            President’s great interest in the so-called <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> Committee Timetable when it had first been
                            considered by the National Security Council last summer.<note n="8" xml:id="d40fn8">See <ref target="#d30">Document 30</ref>.</note> If,
                            said Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName>, he correctly
                            understood the contents of the Planning Board’s report now before the
                            Council, the members of the Planning Board regard the <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> Committee Timetable as of
                            greater importance now than when it had initially been considered. If
                            one links all this up with the recent Soviet moves and maneuvers in the
                            Middle East, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> said he
                            could not avoid a strong feeling that the United States is going through
                            a period which was tantamount to a parting of the ways in terms of
                            national security policy. Of course, continued Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName>, he was as anxious as anyone
                            to hold expenditures down. But he did hope that no doubts as to national
                            security programs would be resolved in favor of some fiscal advantage
                            unless there were very sound reasons for such a resolution. Let us not
                            set some ceiling figure and say that we will do all that we can for the
                            defense of the United States within the limits of this figure. Instead,
                            we should carefully evaluate our national security situation and decide
                            in each case which programs were required and what was the relative risk
                            involved. The Administration must do all that it could to maintain the
                            U.S. on the offensive and not permit it to be shoved into the
                            defensive.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> went on to express
                            strong approval of the President’s directive accelerating the program
                            for the achievement of an intercontinental ballistic missile.<note n="9" xml:id="d40fn9">Reference is presumably to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action No. 1433; see <ref target="#d34fn9">footnote
                                    9, Document 34</ref>.</note> He said he also believed that the
                            high priority now being accorded programs for continental defense was
                            thoroughly justified. Finally, we must not lower our sights at the <pb xml:id="pg_148" n="148" facs="0172"/>wrong time with respect to our
                            programs of military and economic assistance to friendly nations. The
                            Secretary of Defense, concluded Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName>, should be made to feel the wholehearted
                            support of the National Security Council if he decides that the figure
                            for the Defense budget for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957 must
                            be advanced to $38.5 billion.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> commented that he
                            was not sure that the Defense Department could do a reasonable job even
                            with the figure $38.5 billion. <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> certainly did not believe that it could, and it
                            was at any rate going to prove a rough job to carry out the necessary
                            programs with an <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957 budget of $38.5
                            billion.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> said that it was
                            advisable to point out to the Council here that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had just requested that the
                            Administration not freeze the figure for U.S. military and economic
                            assistance programs for the coming fiscal year until he could return and
                            take part in the discussion of these programs.</p>
                        <p>The Director of Central Intelligence said that further examination of the
                            recent Soviet nuclear test<note n="10" xml:id="d40fn10">
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> described this test to the Council at

                                [<hi rend="italic">2 sentences (4 lines of source text) not

                        <p>Admiral Strauss said that he had a somewhat different interpretation of
                            the implications of the Soviet test than had the Director of Central
                            Intelligence. It was Admiral Strauss’ feeling that what had occurred
                            might well turn out to have been the test of a warhead on a ballistic
                            missile. [<hi rend="italic">1 sentence (31 words) not declassified</hi>]
                            Moreover, continued Admiral Strauss, if the Soviets were successful in
                            cutting the lead time for the production of a ballistic missile as
                            rapidly as they had succeeded in cutting the lead time for the
                            production of their recent aircraft types, the date of mid-1958 might
                            actually be too late as marking the end of Period II of the <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> Timetable, during which the
                            United States would enjoy a period of maximum military advantage over
                            the Soviet Union. Admiral Strauss said he preferred to believe that the
                            end of Period II might come as early as mid-1957.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> interrupted to
                            say that he believed that it was a safe assumption that any
                            technological achievement of the United States would be duplicated by
                            the Soviet Union within a period of two years. Somehow or other they
                            seem to have “infiltrated us” to such a degree.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Strauss continued his remarks on lead times by pointing out that
                            the Soviet Union had achieved the Bison bomber in five years, starting
                            from scratch. It had taken the United States seven years to build the
                            B–52 bomber. The Soviets cut out a lot of excess detail and <pb xml:id="pg_149" n="149" facs="0173"/>cut out a lot of testing of
                            their aircraft and weapons. <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> agreed with Admiral Strauss’ conclusions, but
                            pointed out that of course the Russians cared nothing whatever about
                            accidents. We had to be careful of human life and accordingly more
                            careful in our testing.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Strauss then stated his belief that instead of approving the
                            Planning Board report on the <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> Timetable at this time, the National Security
                            Council would be well advised to await further data on the most recent
                            Soviet nuclear test. He repeated his belief that if his fears were borne
                            out it might be necessary to advance the date at which the end of Period
                            II of the Timetable would be reached.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName> pointed out to
                            the Council that the action called for by the <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> Timetable report was simply
                            noting. The report could be readily revised at any later date if any
                            developments pointed to the desirability of revision.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President observed that, so far as he understood, the
                            implications of the <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName>
                            Committee Timetable were to be taken into account by the National
                            Security Council in recommending a revision of the basic national
                            security policy (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5501). To the Vice
                            President, “the big news” from the present report on the <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> Committee Timetable was that
                            the years 1956 to 1958 constituted the period of maximum military
                            advantage for the United States over the Soviet Union. Perhaps, indeed,
                            these years constituted the last period of such advantage that we would
                            have over the Soviets. He asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> whether he was right in this deduction and
                            whether this meant forceful diplomatic steps by the United States to
                            take advantage of its opportunity. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> replied that the Vice President
                            was correct, but pointed out the difficulties which confronted the State
                            Department in the area of diplomatic action. We simply could not make
                            use of our ultimate military force as a means of carrying out our
                            diplomatic moves. To this the Vice President replied that when one sees
                            what the Soviets have been able to achieve throughout an era in which
                            their atomic strength was much less than that of the United States, one
                            dreaded to think what they might do when their atomic strength came to
                            equal that of the United States.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> said that all he
                            could add was a conviction that sooner or later we must “get tough” with
                            the Soviets and tell them bluntly that there were certain things they
                            could not do.</p>

                        <p>At the 267th meeting of the National Security Council on November 21,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> gave an
                            extensive oral briefing on his recent activities and his impressions on
                            a wide range of foreign policy concerns. He discussed the Geneva and
                            Foreign Ministers Conferences, his visits to Italy, Spain, and with
                            Marshal Tito, and his survey of problems in the Near East. After his
                            presentation, the meeting continued:</p>
                        <p>“After a brief pause, the President said that he had a few remarks to
                            make on the subject of Western Europe. Smilingly he said that all the
                            members of the Council realized that this area was one of his pets.
                            Moreover, nearly all those present around this table had been engaged in
                            work with large human organizations. Accordingly all knew the great
                            value to be attached to the morale factor in large organizations. It was
                            by working with the group that the individual achieved his greatest
                            satisfaction and success. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had just touched on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> as an organization which U.S. policy should support
                            harder than ever in view of the fact that Germany was not likely to be
                            united for some time to come. Actually, said the President, the
                            Secretary of State really underestimated the case he had made. The unity
                            of Western Europe today, continued the President, would solve the peace
                            of the world. A solid power mass in Western Europe would ultimately
                            attract to it all the Soviet satellites, and the threat to peace would
                            disappear.</p>
                        <p>“Continuing in this vein, the President said that there was one thing
                            that all of those present could do as individuals to forward the
                            objective he had just mentioned. Whenever occasion arose for any member
                            of the National Security Council to talk in public about foreign policy,
                            that talk should stress the great advantages of a more nearly united
                            Europe—cultural, economic, moral, and otherwise. The President referred
                            to his own speech, made on July 3, 1951, at the <pb xml:id="pg_151" n="151" facs="0175"/>English Speaking Union in London, on the
                            general subject of a United States of Europe. After that speech, the
                            President said, he had gotten the warmest compliments of no less a
                            person than Winston Churchill, who said that the speech, from the point
                            of view of logic, was the best speech which had been delivered in this
                            generation.</p>
                        <p>“At this point, with even greater emphasis the President repeated his
                            view on the desirability of developing in Western Europe a third great
                            power bloc, after which development the United States would be permitted
                            to sit back and relax somewhat. To help to produce such a development it
                            must be demonstrated to all the countries of Western Europe individually
                            that each and every one would profit by the union of them all and that
                            none would lose. The President cited the development of the American
                            historical pattern as an illustration of the point he was making.</p>
                        <p>“Turning next to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> specifically, the
                            President exclaimed ‘For God’s sake let us not be stingy with an ally.’
                            We should, for instance, give our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            allies the chance to use some of our modern weapons. Nike, for instance,
                            should be made available, although, said the President laughingly, Nike
                            was obsolete—but he didn’t wish to be quoted thereon. In point of fact,
                            however, instead of being generous, we treat many of our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies like stepchildren, and then
                            expect them to turn around and commit themselves to fight with us. By
                            such actions we cut our own throats. Our allies certainly ought to know
                            more about our new weapons. Our policy was in great contrast to the
                            generosity which the British had shown in sharing with us their
                            discoveries about radar at the beginning of the second World War.</p>
                        <p>“<persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General Twining</persName> pointed out to
                            the President that we were making fairly good progress in carrying out
                            the views which the President had just stated. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that of course we were
                            inhibited from sharing our atomic weapons with our allies by our own
                            legislation, though Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> believed that we could do a lot more in other
                            weapons fields than we are currently doing to share some of the benefits
                            with our allies.</p>
                        <p>“After repeating once more his suggestion that at every opportunity in
                            public statements and addresses the members of the National Security
                            Council should stress support for the idea of European integration (but
                            should clear their speeches with the Secretary of State), the President
                            terminated this phase of the discussion and inquired whether any member
                            of the Council had any other matters which he wished to bring up for
                            discussion.</p>
                        <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that he had
                            a certain number of things to talk about, but he was not sure that this
                            was the time to bring them up. Important budgetary decisions would have
                            to be made in the next three weeks.</p>
                        <p>“The President, in response to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s statement, said that it would be well to bear
                            in mind the old adage, ‘Be not the first by which the new is tried, nor
                            yet the last to put the old aside.’ While, said the President, he could
                            see a lot in what Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> had said to him the last time they saw him in the
                            hospital at Denver, he was still convinced that the Administration had
                            the means at hand to make budgetary cuts in the Defense Department if we
                            actually had the courage to go ahead and make these cuts. For <pb xml:id="pg_152" n="152" facs="0176"/>example, continued the
                            President, do we really need to have as much air and sea lift as we
                            think we need to have in order to transport our forces rapidly to
                            various trouble spots?</p>
                        <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> then said that
                            what troubled him with respect to our national security policy, was the
                            fact that we had taken on such a ‘lot of losers’ as allies and
                            clients—for example, Korea, Formosa, and Indochina. The Near East, in
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s opinion, was
                            on the contrary an area of real value to the United States which some
                            day might become self-supporting.”</p>
                        <p>After some general discussion on the foreign aid item in the fiscal year
                            1957 budget, the Council turned to the budget of the Defense
                            Department:</p>
                        <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> then pointed out
                            that he had tentatively given the Services a total Defense Department
                            ceiling for the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957 budget of $34
                            billion. The effect of this on the military services had been so
                            explosive that it had almost brought down the Pentagon.</p>
                        <p>“The President said that of course the Council was aware of how anxious
                            he was to balance the budget, but never, of course, at the cost of the
                            welfare of the United States. Nevertheless, he could not overemphasize
                            the importance to our national security itself of balancing the budget.
                            It was obvious that there would be some tough decisions to make.</p>
                        <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that
                            there was very little doubt that we were going to balance the budget
                            this year; it was about next year that he was really worried. Director
                                <persName corresp="#p_HRR1">Hughes</persName>, with a smile, warned
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> that if he was
                            careless and let another billion slip into the 1956 expenditures, the
                            budget for this year would not be balanced. The President inquired
                            whether it was not likely that the Treasury’s income would continue to
                            go up. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> replied
                            that this was somewhat difficult to say.</p>
                        <p>“The President then turned to <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General
                                Twining</persName> and said that he wished to put a question to him.
                            What exactly did <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General Twining</persName>
                            think of the value of the seaward extensions of our early warning line
                            for continental defense? <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General
                                Twining</persName> replied that he thought these extensions were
                            ‘pretty vital now’. The President expressed some skepticism of the value
                            of these extensions, and noted the extremely high cost of developing
                            them.” (Memorandum of discussion by <persName corresp="#p_GSE1">Gleason</persName>; Eisenhower Library, Whitman File, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Records)</p>
                        <p>After more discussion on foreign aid programs, the Council adopted <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action No. 1480. As a result of the
                            President’s comments on Western Europe, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action No. 1480–b, approved by the President on
                            December 1, was formally recorded as follows:</p>
                        <p>“Noted the President’s expressed conviction that European integration,
                            with West Germany playing a part, would be a major contribution to world
                            peace; that a unified Europe (achieved by strengthening and expanding
                            into other areas the concepts of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>,
                            the Brussels Pact, and the Coal and Steel Community) would constitute a
                            focus of power, in addition to the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, which would greatly advance the material and moral
                            well-being of European peoples and the security interests of the United

                            appropriate way of seeking the objective of European integration.”

                        <p>“2. Increasing the military budget to provide for the improvement of the

                        <p>“4. Continually applying pressure on the Soviet bloc to expose the

                        <p>1. In Action No. 1433 the National Security Council on September 8, 1955,
                            “requested the Department of State to report to the Council, not later
                            than December 1, 1955, on the foreign policy implications of <pb xml:id="pg_155" n="155" facs="0179"/>a demonstration by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> that it had developed an

                            an estimate of the extent to which U.S. achievement of a 1500-mile
                            missile would counter the implications of a Soviet achievement of an
                                <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> or a 1500-mile missile.”</p>

                        <p>2. The problem, as thus posed, calls for an evaluation of four
                            alternative contingencies:</p>
                        <p>(a) the Soviets achieve a medium-range missile ahead of the U.S.;</p>
                        <p>(b) the U.S. and the Soviets simultaneously achieve a medium-range
                            missile;</p>
                        <p>(c) the Soviets achieve an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> before
                            the U.S. achieves a medium-range missile;</p>
                        <p>(d) the U.S. achieves a medium-range missile at the same time as the

                        </p>
                        <p>3. The Soviet leaders will wish to avoid general war, at least so long as
                            they believe that this might involve heavy nuclear attacks upon the
                            U.S.S.R. They would, even after developing a 1500-mile missile, not take
                            actions which they expected greatly to increase the risk of general war.
                            Their view of the risks that would attach to specific Bloc actions might
                            be altered, however, since they might expect U.S. leaders to be moved to
                            caution by the view that prior Soviet development of a medium-range
                            missile had somewhat worsened the relative U.S. power position. The
                            Communists might thus embark on a somewhat more aggressive policy, which
                            could increase the danger of war through miscalculation.</p>
                        <p>4. The first reaction on the part of free-world countries to prior Soviet
                            development of a medium-range missile would probably be dismay at this
                            evidence that the U.S.S.R. was capable of more rapid technological
                            progress than the U.S. Present confidence in U.S. strength, which rests
                            on a contrary assumption, would be impaired.</p>
                        <p>5. As time went on, increasing consideration would also be given to the
                            potential effect of these missiles on Western Europe and Japan in the
                            event of war. While most Japanese and Europeans already consider that
                            their countries would be devastated in a war, this belief <pb xml:id="pg_156" n="156" facs="0180"/>would be powerfully
                            strengthened by Soviet possession of a megaton missile against which
                            there was no defense and whose launching sites were practically
                            invulnerable to attack. The fact that the West did not also have a
                            weapon against which there was no defense, but would be relying on
                            aircraft delivery against which some defense is possible could, at the
                            same time, reduce confidence in the Western deterrent to Soviet
                            attack.</p>
                        <p>6. Because of this increased fear of the consequences of war and reduced
                            confidence in U.S. strength, groups which have been advocating a policy
                            of greater independence from the U.S. would be encouraged, and many
                            persons who have been tending in this direction would find
                            rationalization at hand to warrant a more explicit shift. Some
                            governments, for example in Japan, would find themselves under
                            increasing pressure to modify their policies to reflect these trends in
                            public opinion. The steps which they might take as a result would
                            probably not involve major change in their basic policies, at least in
                            the first instance, but might create frictions with the U.S. which could
                            have a serious cumulative impact on relations between them and the
                            U.S.</p>
                        <p>7. There would, in any event, almost certainly be increased resistance on
                            the part of U.S. allies to any U.S. policies which were believed to
                            carry risks of war. Some allied governments might also become more
                            inclined to modify their positions on such issues as disarmament if they
                            believe that an accommodation with the U.S.S.R. on these issues would
                            significantly reduce the risk of war.</p>
                        <p>8. If these more independent allied attitudes and policies generated
                            public pressures in the U.S. for a more unilateral U.S. policy, this
                            would become evident to our allies. They might then feel that they could
                            no longer depend on the U.S. and should reduce even further their ties
                            with the U.S. Pressures for limiting U.S. base rights might begin to
                            mount.</p>
                        <p>9. The U.S.S.R. could play skillfully upon this situation, by suggesting
                            to U.S. allies that it would be possible to reach “reasonable”
                            agreements with the Bloc and thus to re-orient their foreign policies
                            away from the U.S. A conciliatory Communist posture might thus convince
                            a considerable body of opinion in allied countries that it would be
                            feasible to follow a middle course in the cold war and, in this way,
                            surely to avoid the horrors which could now be visited on their
                            countries in the event of war.</p>
                        <p>10. The cumulative effect of mutually reinforcing events in allied
                            countries, the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. could thus be gravely to weaken the
                            effectiveness of U.S. alliances. While present governments in most
                            allied countries would probably continue to estimate that U.S.
                            thermonuclear striking power remained adequate to deter Communist attack
                            and would, therefore, maintain the alliances with the U.S. which enabled
                                <pb xml:id="pg_157" n="157" facs="0181"/>them to profit from that
                            deterrent, the impact of the forces and events described above could
                            render this connection increasingly tenuous.</p>
                        <p>11. If the Bloc’s foreign policy became somewhat more aggressive as a
                            result of its achievement of a medium-range missile, some allied
                            governments would begin to doubt that U.S. deterrent power was still
                            effective. This would intensify the trend toward neutralism described
                            above. If the Bloc took actions which made general war seem an imminent
                            probability, the popular demand for accommodation in countries that were
                            under direct pressures from the Bloc and for neutrality in other
                            countries might well become irresistible. While this possibility would
                            exist, at least to some extent, whether or not the Soviets had achieved
                            a medium-range missile, it would be strengthened by this
                            development.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">B. Simultaneous U.S. and Soviet Achievement</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>12. If the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. both developed 1500-mile missiles, the
                            Kremlin would probably consider that this altered the balance of power,
                            potentially at least, to the Bloc’s disadvantage. For while the Bloc had
                            only acquired the capability to destroy U.S. overseas bases and allies,
                            the U.S. would have become able to strike at the centers of Communist
                            power—if it could operate from launching sites on the Bloc’s periphery.
                            The Bloc would try, probably by alternately “hard” and “soft” tactics,
                            to persuade countries on its perphery not to permit such sites to be
                            constructed. If these efforts failed, Communist leaders would probably
                            estimate that they were entering upon a period of relative military
                            inferiority which would last until their acquisition of an
                            intercontinental missile. They might fear that this advantage would
                            stimulate the U.S. to a greater willingness to risk war and feel,
                            therefore, that they had to show even greater caution than at present if
                            they were to avoid war. They would be unlikely, however, to surrender
                            any of their present positions of strength, e.g., in the satellites or
                            East Germany, to this end. They would expect such a surrender merely to
                            strengthen U.S. power and to stimulate the U.S. to further demands,
                            which would be more dangerous to Soviet security and more difficult
                            peacefully to resist.</p>
                        <p>13. If the U.S. achieved a 1500-mile missile simultaneously with the
                            U.S.S.R., free-world countries would be relieved that Soviet technology
                            had not outstripped that of the U.S., but they would still be concerned
                            at their own increased vulnerability. U.S. possession of a medium-range
                            missile would not, in their view, reduce this vulnerability any more
                            than the existence of <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> does now. The
                            availability of U.S. medium-range missiles would, however, strengthen
                            their confidence <pb xml:id="pg_158" n="158" facs="0182"/>in the U.S.
                            deterrent power. The trend toward neutralism would thus be less than if
                            the Soviets alone had achieved a missile but greater than if neither
                            side had achieved a missile.</p>
                        <p>14. Soviet efforts to dissuade free countries from granting missile bases
                            to the U.S. would probably fail, since these countries would believe
                            that they were maximizing the deterrent to war by allowing such bases to
                            be placed on their territory. This would, of course, not be true if
                            these countries believed that the Soviets were sufficiently in earnest
                            to make war on them if they refused to heed its pressures. They would be
                            less likely to believe any Soviet threats to this effect, and so more
                            likely to grant base rights, in the event of simultaneous U.S. and
                            Soviet achievement of a missile than in the event of prior Soviet
                            achievement. If, on the other hand, the U.S. tried to exploit its
                            achievement of a 1500-mile missile by adopting a tougher stance toward
                            the U.S.S.R., most U.S. allies would probably be moved by their fear of
                            war to seek a more neutral position in the East-West struggle.</p>

                        <p>15. The Soviet leaders would probably only initiate general war if they
                            felt a high degree of certainty that the U.S.S.R. would not be exposed
                            to nuclear devastation during its course. It seems unlikely that their
                            possession of an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> would cause them
                            to feel this degree of certainty. They would fear that sufficient <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> aircraft might survive a surprise
                            attack, whether because they were dispersed or because they were already
                            in the air, to permit the U.S. to retaliate on a very large scale
                            against the U.S.S.R. The Soviet leaders would, therefore, probably only
                            attempt to capitalize on free world reactions to their new capacities by
                            a more aggressive foreign policy in so far as they thought that they
                            could do this without precipitating a thermonuclear conflict.</p>
                        <p>16. If free world countries believed that Soviet achievement of an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> endangered the U.S. retaliatory
                            capability, they would lose confidence in the U.S. deterrent. They might
                            then be willing to break their alliances with the U.S. under extreme
                            Soviet pressure, since they would fear that these alliances might
                            stimulate rather than avert Soviet attack upon them.</p>
                        <p>17. If, as seems more likely in the light of the reasoning suggested in
                            paragraph 15, free world countries did not believe that Soviet prior
                            development of an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> endangered the
                            U.S. retaliatory capability, they would react to this achievement much
                            as they would to Soviet prior achievement of a medium-range missile—only
                            more so. There would be one new element in their reactions, moreover:
                            They could not help but wonder whether the U.S. willingness to act in
                            their behalf <pb xml:id="pg_159" n="159" facs="0183"/>would be reduced
                            by the apparently greater U.S. vulnerability to nuclear attack. To the
                            extent that the U.S.S.R. was able to exploit this doubt, there would be
                            a greater likelihood that some nations, especially those on the
                            periphery of the Bloc, would accede to Soviet pressures. But the course
                            of events would depend so much on the ability of the U.S. to display a
                            convincing determination not to be outbluffed and on the readiness of
                            the U.S.S.R to go far in risking war that speculation of a
                            particularized sort is probably idle.</p>
                        <p>18. One important variable would be the timing of the Soviet achievement.
                            Its impact would naturally be less if it followed Soviet achievement of
                            such air-nuclear capabilities as would enable the U.S.S.R. utterly to
                            devastate the U.S. For, in this event, Soviet development of an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> would—like Soviet development of a
                            medium-range missile—be generally taken to dramatize, rather than to
                            alter basically, the existing situation. Even in this case, however, the
                            strain on U.S. alliances and the trend toward neutralism would probably
                            be greater, on account of the more explicit U.S. vulnerability to
                            instant devastation, than if the Soviets had merely achieved a
                            medium-range missile ahead of the U.S.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>19. If the U.S. achieved a 1500-mile missile at the same time as the
                            U.S.S.R. achieved an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>, the leaders
                            of the Bloc would probably conclude that both sides had gained in
                            something like equal proportions and that general war had been rendered
                            vastly more destructive for them both. Their reaction to this situation
                            would probably be along the same general lines as their reactions to a
                            condition of “nuclear stalemate”, which might already have occurred. It
                            would differ from their reaction to prior achievement of an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> principally in so far as differing
                            free world reactions seemed to offer lesser opportunities for
                            exploitation.</p>
                        <p>20. Free world countries would take a less discouraged view of U.S.
                            technological capacities if the U.S. achieved a 1500-mile missile
                            simultaneously with the Soviets than if the U.S.S.R. alone achieved such
                            a missile. They would consider—like the Soviets—that U.S. achievement of
                            a 1500-mile missile and Soviet development of an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> made war even more destructive than
                            previously. The extent to which they would consider that this altered
                            the U.S. situation would depend on the extent to which the Soviets had
                            been generally believed, prior to their achievement of an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>, to possess the capability to
                            devastate the U.S. Even if such a condition of apparent “nuclear
                            stalemate” had already been believed to exist, however, free world
                            countries might be concerned, at least for a while, lest U.S. or Soviet
                            policy change as a result of the more explicit U.S. vulnerability.</p>

                        <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                        <p>21. Soviet prior achievement of a medium-range missile would greatly
                            reduce the free world’s confidence in U.S. technological superiority and
                            enhance its fears as to the consequences of war. While existing
                            governments’ confidence in the deterrent effect of U.S. retaliatory
                            capabilities would cause them to maintain their alliances with the U.S.,
                            they might be under increasing public pressure to adopt a posture which
                            reflected greater independence of the U.S. This could lead them to take
                            a number of steps, none of which would be of great importance
                            individually but all of which taken together could suggest a somewhat
                            more “third force” orientation in the cold war. U.S. allies would,
                            furthermore, almost certainly be more vigorous than now in opposing U.S.
                            policies which they believed to carry any risk of war. They might also
                            be more willing to compromise their present positions on outstanding
                            East-West issues if they believed that this would reduce the chances of
                            war. If U.S. opinion pressed for a more unilateral policy in reaction to
                            these allied attitudes, U.S. allies might wish to reduce even further
                            their dependence on the U.S. The Soviets could hasten the resulting
                            trend toward neutralism by a skillful combination of conciliatory
                            tactics, intended to persuade U.S. allies that accommodation with the
                            Bloc might be had on reasonable terms, and of aggressive gestures
                            designed to emphasize that these countries’ alliances with the U.S.
                            could involve them in war.</p>
                        <p>22. Simultaneous U.S. achievement of a medium-range missile would help to
                            sustain confidence in U.S. strength but it would not prevent U.S. allies
                            from feeling that they were more vulnerable than before to widespread
                            devastation in the event of war. Trends toward neutralism or
                            accommodation would thus be less than if the U.S.S.R. alone had achieved
                            a missile but greater than if neither side had developed this
                            weapon.</p>
                        <p>23. Prior Soviet achievement of an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                            would have the same effects, on a somewhat different scale, as prior
                            Soviet achievement of a medium-range missile. It would also raise doubts
                            in the free world as to the U.S. willingness to resist—and hence the
                            U.S. ability to deter— Communist peripheral expansion, in view of the
                            increased U.S. vulnerability to instant devastation. U.S. alliances
                            could probably still be maintained, unless U.S. inaction in the face of
                            Communist pressure confirmed these doubts, but the threat to the
                            cohesion of the Western coalition would be greater than under any other
                            circumstances envisaged in this paper.</p>
                        <p>24. U.S. achievement of a medium-range missile at the same time as the
                            U.S.S.R. achieved an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>, while
                            leaving doubts as to U.S. willingness to risk <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> attack by resisting local aggression, would <pb xml:id="pg_161" n="161" facs="0185"/>strengthen free-world
                            confidence in the U.S. retaliatory power. The effect of this
                            circumstance on the cohesion of U.S. alliances would thus be somewhat
                            less than that of a prior Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                            achievement.</p>

                            assurance of bettering the time schedule set for the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>. It was further determined that in
                            order to carry out these programs at the maximum rate technology will
                            permit, it would be necessary to devise a specialized management
                            structure to minimize the delays inherent in program review and
                            administration and the potential interference between these programs.
                            There is at present no cheap and easy way which will permit the earlier
                            achievement of a militarily usable weapon. Furthermore, it is believed
                            that the early flight tests of the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> vehicles during 1957 will
                            satisfy the possible need for “demonstrations.” During the development
                            of these missiles reasonable relaxation of range and accuracy
                            requirements will be subject to constant consideration should advances
                            in the operational availability dates be achievable. Further relaxation
                            of reliability is subject to serious question since these missiles will
                            be flying over friendly territory.</p>
                        <p>In keeping with the above, there has been established separate
                            development programs for the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> and
                            the <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program is that already underway in the Air Force as

                        <p>(1) Two contractors have been selected and contractual arrangements made
                            for each major component of the missile system, such as the propulsion
                            unit, the airframe, and the guidance and control units. Since July the
                            major advance in this respect has been the selection of the Glenn L.
                            Martin Company which will develop a two-stage configuration as the
                            second airframe source.</p>
                        <p>(2) Initial flight testing, designed to assist in nose cone design, has
                            begun at the Air Force Missile Test Center (Banana River, Florida). Of a
                            planned total of 36 X–17 re-entry test vehicles, three have been fired
                            to date.</p>
                        <p>(3) Prime contractor <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> personnel
                            total 8700 as of 15 November 1955.</p>
                        <p>(4) Funding has been adequate for all purposes, but facility acquisition
                            has not been so rapid as desired. The new streamlined management
                            structure is expected to correct this deficiency.</p>
                        <p>(5) A new development plan for the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                            has been prepared to take advantage of the revised organization and the
                            modified management controls and administrative procedures. This plan
                            was devised with the objective of using it as an overall management and

                        <p>(6) The program for attaining the earliest operational <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> deterrent capability has been under

                        <p>In planning the <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> program, the
                            recommendations of the Technological Capabilities Panel, the advice of
                            the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the U.S. technological capability in the
                            ballistic missile field were considered. Five possible actions were
                            proposed to meet the indicated need:</p>
                        <p>(1) Use of second stage of the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                            program.</p>
                        <p>(2) A separate <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> project based on
                            available designs.</p>
                        <p>(3) Support of the proposed United Kingdom <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> development.</p>
                        <p>(4) A separate ship-launched <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>
                            development.</p>
                        <p>(5) Use of Triton.</p>
                        <p>There is general technical agreement that a land-based version of an
                                <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> can be developed earlier than
                            a ship-launched version. However, the desirability of a ship-launched
                                <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> capability is so apparent that
                            its strong consideration is believed to be warranted.</p>
                        <p>To meet existing military needs at the earliest possible date the
                            Department of Defense has initiated an <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> program having two separate objectives:</p>
                        <p>(1) The development of a land-based <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>
                                (<gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> #1) by the Air Force at the
                            earliest possible date. In the conduct of this program the Air Force
                            will make use of any applicable components or techniques developed
                            within the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program. This approach
                            was adopted after it was shown that a direct “fall out” missile from the
                                <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program such as the use of the
                                <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> second stage is not
                            technically feasible.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_165" n="165" facs="0189"/>
                        <p>(2) The initiation of a development program (<gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> #2) having the dual objective of achieving the
                            earliest possible ship-launched capability and also providing a
                            land-based alternate to the Air Force <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> #1 program. The <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>
                            #2 program will be conducted jointly by the Army and Navy. Analysis of
                            the Navy requirements indicate that a missile technically different from
                            the planned Air Force approach will be required. However, in the
                            development of a missile for ship-launching it is necessary to go
                            through a land-launched phase thereby providing with a minimum of
                            modification a land-based alternate to the Air Force <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> #1 program. To assure achievement of
                            the land-based as well as ship-launched <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> capability equal priority has been assigned to the
                                <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> #1 and <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> #2 programs. To minimize the
                            potential interference to the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                            program, maximum use will be made of contractors with experience in this
                            field but not having major commitments within the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program. Also, use will be made of
                            the Redstone Arsenal team which has extensive experience in the design
                            and firing of large ballistic rockets.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of current estimates of the technical state of the art it is
                            believed that a surface ship-launching capability for an <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> may be achieved appreciably earlier
                            than a submarine launching capability. Accordingly the initial
                            ship-launched version is planned for application to surface ships rather
                            than submarines. Therefore development will continue of the
                            submarine-launched ramjet propelled Triton missile.</p>
                        <p>United States interest and technical support of the United Kingdom
                            ballistic missile program is continuing. Nevertheless, an operational
                            missile cannot be expected from this program for several years after a
                            U.S. capability has been achieved. Continued support of this program
                            will strengthen appreciably the United Kingdom potential in this
                            critical area and will provide additional highly skilled manpower in the
                            support of our combined development objectives.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName> suggested that
                            the next item, the report on the vulnerabilities of <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>, be postponed at this time in favor of
                            Council consideration of the three items dealing with ballistic
                            missiles. He then called on Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> to speak to the reference report (copy filed in
                            the Minutes of the meeting).<note n="3" xml:id="d45fn3">Not found in the

                        <p>After Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had
                            completed his summary of the report on the foreign policy implications
                            of a Soviet intercontinental ballistic missile, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> stated that what he deduced from
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ report was that
                            the United States should push its programs for achieving an
                            intercontinental ballistic missile and intermediate range ballistic
                            missile just as hard as it possibly could. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> agreed, but added that it was of
                            great importance that we consider carefully how to minimize the
                            consequences of a Russian achievement of these weapons prior to the
                            United States. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            warned that it was going to be very difficult to persuade public opinion
                            on this score. If the Soviets got either of these missiles before the
                            United States, we could surely count on the Soviets’ dramatizing their
                            new capability to the limit.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> spoke first
                            on the subject of the missile programs in order to put the problem in
                            its context and provide the necessary background. He said that after he
                            had finished his part of <pb xml:id="pg_168" n="168" facs="0192"/>the
                            presentation, the three detailed programs would be treated separately in
                            the space of approximately ten minutes each. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> then proceeded to summarize
                            the general <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss> arrangements for the
                            achievement of U.S. ballistic missiles, as set forth in the reference
                            memorandum (copy filed in the Minutes of the meeting).</p>
                        <p>While Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> was
                            explaining, with the assistance of charts, the complicated organizations
                            set up in the Defense Department to carry out these programs, the
                            President interrupted to inquire how often these several <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss> committees met and what did they
                            accomplish. He said he was deeply suspicious of committees as a method
                            of getting things done promptly.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName>’s remarks, the President said that as he
                            remembered it, when the <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName>
                            Committee had brought in their original recommendation with respect to
                            the <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> programs, it had been their view that the development
                            of the intermediate range missile would come along naturally in the
                            course of developing the intercontinental ballistic missile. Now,
                            according to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName>, all this had been changed and there were separate
                            projects, one to achieve the intermediate range missile and the longer
                            range missile. Before Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> could explain, the President, with great
                            emphasis, stressed the essentiality of the United States achieving these
                            missiles, and pointed out that “the best was always the enemy of the
                            good.” If we did not put every effort into getting an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> we would never get one. The President
                            explained that he was not challenging the contents of Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName>’s report, but he
                            was merely astonished at the difference between the information given
                            him by the <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> report in
                            July and the present report by the Department of Defense.</p>
                        <p>In the succeeding moments various people attempted to explain to the
                            President that there was no conflict between the recommendations of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> committee and the
                            present report by the Department of Defense. Mr. Robert Sprague,
                            Consultant to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> and very familiar
                            with the <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> Committee
                            report, indicated that the President was under a misapprehension, and
                            that the <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> Committee had
                            warmly endorsed separate programs for the achievement of the
                            intermediate range and the long-range ballistic missiles.</p>
                        <p>The President said he had a final point to make to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName>. The latter had said in the
                            course of his presentation that henceforth the status of the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss> programs for achieving a U.S. missile
                            capability would be reported as a normal part of the annual report of
                            the Department of Defense on the status of the U.S. military programs.
                            On the contrary, said the President with great warmth of feeling, the
                            Secretary of Defense was going to report to him on the developments in
                            these programs at least once a month. The President said he was
                            absolutely determined not to tolerate any fooling with this thing. We
                                <pb xml:id="pg_169" n="169" facs="0193"/>had simply got to achieve
                            such missiles as promptly as possible, if only because of the enormous
                            psychological and political significance of ballistic missiles.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> was followed
                            by Assistant Secretary of Defense Trevor Gardner,<note n="6" xml:id="d45fn6">Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Research and
                                Development).</note> who opened his presentation by expressing his
                            appreciation of the enthusiasm which the President was showing for
                            getting ahead with developing ballistic missiles. He then cited
                            comparative statistics as to test firings of missiles, guided and
                            otherwise, in the Soviet Union and in the United States in the course of
                            the last calendar year. Of the Russian firings at least 13 were presumed
                            to be of ballistic missiles. Secretary Gardner judged that the Soviets
                            were probably two years ahead of us in progress toward the achievement
                            of a ballistic missile.</p>
                        <p>After Secretary Gardner had proceeded to outline the status of the Air
                            Force programs for the achievement of an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>, he was followed by Secretary Thomas, who described
                            the joint Army-Navy program. Secretary Thomas was followed in turn by
                            Major General Medaris, <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>,<note n="7" xml:id="d45fn7">Major General John B. Medaris, <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>, Commanding General, U.S. Army
                                Ballistic Missile Agency.</note> on the program for the development
                            of the 1500-mile so-called intermediate range ballistic missile.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of these separate reports, the President commented that
                            each of those who had reported seemed to be bragging about how much had
                            been done since the job had been assigned to the reporter’s organization
                            on November [<hi rend="italic">September</hi>] 8. The President said he
                            would like to know what had been going on since last July, when he had
                            issued his strong directive on achievement of a U.S. capability in the
                            field of ballistic missiles. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> undertook to assure the President that, despite
                            appearances, no time had really been lost, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> reassured the President on
                            the display of teamwork among the three military services.</p>
                        <p>At the end of the discussion, the President referred to the mass of
                            letters and telegrams which he was receiving from people all over the
                            country, insisting that the program in the U.S. to achieve a ballistic
                            missile should be placed in the hands of one single individual and that
                            everything should be done to hurry the project to completion. These
                            people had generally insisted that the country which first achieved an
                            intercontinental ballistic missile would rule the world. The President
                            said that he was somewhat skeptical of the latter point and of the
                            unique importance of the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> from a
                            strictly military point of view. On the other hand, he fully subscribed
                            to the views of the Secretary of State as to the profound and overriding
                            political and psychological importance of the U.S. achieving such a
                            weapon.</p>

                                21, and in a memorandum of the same date to Secretary of Defense
                                    <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, he explained his
                                action as follows:<p>“It was with some qualms that I approved the
                                    plan of allowing three different Services to work on the problem
                                    of long-range ballistic missiles. This doubt was inspired not
                                    only by historical difficulties in achieving adequate
                                    coordination among the Services, but because of the uneasy
                                    feeling in my own mind that the August-to-November delay in
                                    issuing the necessary Defense directives in this matter had been
                                    occasioned by arguments among them as to who was to carry the
                                    responsibility. All this seemed to me to presage similar
                                    difficulties in the future. However, on your assurance that in
                                    the current plan all such differences were, and would continue
                                    to be, eliminated and that in your opinion two separate programs
                                    could be carried on simultaneously and with the resulting
                                    benefits of competition, all to be achieved without mutual
                                    interference, I approved the system that the Defense Department
                                    suggested.” (Eisenhower Library, Whitman File, Guided

                            </note> approved a through c above, and issued the following directive
                            instead of approving the recommendation in d above:</p>
                        <p>“The President directed that the <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> programs should both be
                            research and development programs of the highest priority above all
                            others. Mutual interference between these programs should be avoided so
                            far as practicable, but if a conflict should occur in which strict
                            application of paragraph c above would, in the opinion of the Secretary
                            of Defense, cause major damage to the security interests of the United
                            States, then the matter will be promptly referred to the President.”</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> advised that this agenda item concerned
                            the vulnerability of the Strategic Air Command to enemy attack from the
                            air or to either conventional or nuclear sabotage; that the <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> Committee had urged in its
                            report that the present “unacceptable” ground vulnerability of <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> be reduced more rapidly than
                            contemplated by the various Department of Defense programs under way in
                            that area; and that the Committee had suggested accordingly that the
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> examine three possible
                            countermeasures: (1) construction of additional bases as a top priority
                            emergency program; (2) institution of an emergency dispersal program, in
                            which more airfields—including civilian ones—would be used; and (3) an
                            increase in active defenses by diverting anti-aircraft guns and guided
                            missiles from defense positions around cities to <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> bases. Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> advised that,
                            pursuant to the foregoing, the Council agreed that, because the security
                            of <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> was so vital to U.S. basic
                            national security policy, it should be briefed on the vulnerability of
                                <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>. He then introduced Major
                            General R.C. Lindsay, <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>,<note n="3" xml:id="d46fn3">Director of Plans, Headquarters, <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>.</note> who made a 35-minute
                            presentation thereon.</p>
                        <p>Upon the completion of General Lindsay’s briefing, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> inquired whether there could
                            be effected between now and 1957 any technological improvements for
                                <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> additional to those outlined in
                            the briefing. General Lindsay responded in the negative. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> inquired whether there could
                            be effected between now and 1962 any technological improvements for
                                <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> additional to those now
                            programmed, as outlined in General Lindsay’s presentation. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName>, noting that it is a long time
                            between now and 1962, said he had in mind some of the technological
                            developments proposed by the <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> Committee which were not covered in General
                            Lindsay’s presentation.</p>
                        <p>The President, in response to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName>, commented that we haven’t had any <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> Committee to tell us the
                            Russian side of the story. He believed that the Russians too have major
                            problems to be met in this whole area. He thought there is a limit on
                            the amount of money that the United States can spend on such
                            improvements. He <pb xml:id="pg_172" n="172" facs="0196"/>commented
                            that, from a long-term standpoint, the United States must, if possible,
                            keep within budget levels in thinking of such problems over the next
                            sixty years or so.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> said it was his
                            understanding that, when the Planning Board was briefed on this subject
                            last week, some reference had been made to matériel and manpower
                            difficulties affecting the security and strike capability of the <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> forces. He said that if such were in
                            fact the case, it was possible to do something about both situations, if
                            funds alone were the source of the manpower and matériel
                            difficulties.</p>
                        <p>The President thought that if such were the case the officials
                            responsible would be coming forward with advice to that effect.</p>
                        <p>General Lindsay indicated that funds alone were not the chief source of
                            the problem.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> inquired whether,
                            in terms of <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>’s dispersal program, the
                            construction of weapons sites was moving forward in step with <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>’s program for dispersing its aircraft.
                            Admiral Strauss responded that there is only a very slight lag between
                            the two programs; that it is a natural one and not of such proportions
                            as to be cause for concern.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> commented, with
                            respect to the general subject, that the stark facts are that the
                            developments on both sides (U.S. and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>) are such that in time both will be able to destroy
                            the world, including the birds.</p>

                        <p>On December 8, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            addressed the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association at Chicago which he
                            later cited, in a December 28 memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName>, as an explication of United States post-Geneva
                            policy. (Department of State, <gloss target="#t_PPS1">PPS</gloss> Files:
                            Lot 66 D 70, Foreign Policy) In the course of this speech on the “new
                            phase of the struggle with international communism,” the Secretary gave
                            further sanction to the doctrine of “less-than-massive retaliation” that
                            he had spoken of in March. See <ref target="#d15">Document 15</ref>.</p>
                        <p>Quoting passages from his earlier speeches and articles,
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> said that to give the idea of collective
                            security a sensible and effective content, “the arsenal of retaliation
                            should include all forms of counterattack with a maximum flexibility.”
                            To deter aggression, the free world needed to have a choice of responses
                            available and not be in the position “where the only response open to it
                            is general war.” According to the Secretary, such a program was now a
                            reality. The United States had developed with its allies “a collective
                            system of great power which can be flexibly used on whatever scale may
                            be requisite to make aggression costly. Our <hi rend="italic">capacity</hi> to retaliate must be, and is, massive in order to
                            deter all forms of aggression. But if we have to <hi rend="italic">use</hi> that capacity, such use would be selective and adapted to
                            the occasion.” (Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>,

                        <p>2. In addition to the Office of Defense Mobilization and the Department
                            of Defense, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, the Central

                            Science Foundation have participated in the preparation of the report.
                            limited time available has precluded exhaustive study of the complex
                            problems involved. There is obvious need for continuing study and action
                            by all of the great number of Federal Agencies which play a part in
                            furthering U.S. technology.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Estimate of the Situation and the Problem</p>
                        <p>3. Through intensive application of science and technology, the U.S. and
                            the U.S.S.R. have today achieved weapons and means for their delivery by
                            which each could inflict great devastation upon the other despite
                            existing defenses. The rapidly approaching era of balanced nuclear
                            capability between the two powers will probably establish a mutual
                            deterrence to general war, and possibly though not necessarily to local
                            aggressions, which can be maintained into the future provided neither
                            side achieves by technological “breakthrough” or overall technological
                            superiority a capability which would permit it to attack the other with
                            confidence that its own homeland could not be devastated in retaliation.
                            The U.S., even if it achieved such superiority, would not indulge in
                            preventive war, but no such assurance can be felt about the Soviet
                            Union. Thus the maintenance of technological superiority by the U.S.
                            over the U.S.S.R. could mean the difference between peace and general
                            nuclear war.</p>
                        <p>4. The relative technological superiority of the U.S. and the U.S.S.R.
                            must be first of all considered in terms of continued maintenance of
                            short-run technological superiority by the U.S. Unless the short-run
                            problem in the decisive period which we are approaching is successfully
                            solved, there may be no long run. This involves a selective approach on
                            the crucial new weapons and weapons systems which determine the
                            capability to annihilate or to prevent annihilation. This critical fact
                            has already been recognized by the National Security Council in the
                            unique priorities and organizational programs <pb xml:id="pg_175" n="175" facs="0199"/>laid down for both the <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>.<note n="3" xml:id="d48fn3">See <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action

                        </p>
                        <p>5. From incomplete data, it may be estimated that in certain important
                            fields of weaponry the Soviets are now several years in advance of U.S.
                            technology. For example, in terms of service ceiling of interceptor
                            aircraft and the time they require to climb to that ceiling, the
                            U.S.S.R. may be two to four years ahead of the U.S. In long-range
                            ballistic missiles the U.S.S.R. may be leading by two or more years. In
                            the combat range of tanks without refueling, U.S. tanks have only about
                            one-third to one-half the range of Soviet tanks. Much more pertinent
                            comparisons are those between the service ceilings of our radar and
                            interceptor weapons systems compared to the ceilings of Soviet bombers;
                            the comparison between their interceptors and our bombers; and the
                            comparison between the stage of Soviet development in long-range
                            ballistic missiles and our development of defenses against such
                            missiles. Such comparisons are not reassuring from the U.S. point of
                            view. We are relatively well off for the time being in the most
                            important comparison of all—that between the totality of our offensive
                            systems and those of the Soviets—but on the basis of current trends it
                            will take continuous, unrelenting effort on the part of the U.S. to
                            maintain such superiority on into the future.</p>
                        <p>6. Action on the short-run problem lies primarily within the
                            responsibilities of the Department of Defense, requires adequate funds
                            and other resources and the speeding up of important projects already
                            underway. Thus a basic requirement is the simplification of the
                            decision-making, clearance and coordinating functions within the
                            Department and the assigning of appropriate priorities of effort. The
                            Department of Defense is actively studying at its highest level the ways
                            and means by which its management and operations from research on into
                            production may be drastically speeded up. This study can be of vital
                            importance, particularly if the National Security Council evidences an
                            active interest in it and provides the stimulus of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> and Presidential support.</p>
                        <p>7. The problem of achieving and maintaining technological superiority
                            over the long run is deeply rooted in the fundamental dynamics of
                            technology itself and in the factors which give it direction and
                            maintain its creative vigor. Consequently, efforts toward technological
                            superiority should not be focused on weapons systems alone but must
                            broadly reflect superiority:</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_176" n="176" facs="0200"/>
                        <p>a. As manifested in the totality of operational weapons available at any
                            given time and the ability to neutralize by defensive or offensive means
                            any technological military threat;</p>
                        <p>b. As manifested in the development and employment of superior technology
                            for the achievement of peaceful purposes both nationally and in
                            cooperation with other nations;</p>
                        <p>c. As demonstrated by superior inventiveness and in the development of
                            new knowledge through basic research;</p>
                        <p>d. As a potential embodied in the development of an adequate number of
                            highly qualified scientists and engineers and in the maintenance of an
                            expanding system of technological institutions and facilities in a
                            vigorous state of health.</p>
                        <p>8. Although achievement of technological superiority in the short-run is
                            imperative, it is essential that we commence with no further delay
                            actions needed to assure long-range technological superiority.</p>
                        <p>9. The Soviets are continually expanding their educatonal facilities for
                            the training of scientists and engineers. They are now graduating such
                            persons in considerably greater numbers than the U.S. The best of their
                            graduates are apparently fully the equal of our best, and there is
                            evidence to show that the top administrators of Soviet research and
                            development are first class scientists. Additonally, the Soviets have
                            built up a superior complex for effectively utilizing their scientific
                            and engineering manpower. They have created facilities, research
                            centers, specialized institutes, and administrative policies and
                            procedures, including effective methods for utilizing all possible Free
                            World scientific information, which have enabled a high and increasing
                            rate of technological advance, particularly in military fields. They
                            have also developed a remarkably speedy cycle from research through to
                            the quantity production of finished weapons.</p>
                        <p>10. Achievement and maintenance of technological superiority, both in the
                            short-run and for an indefinite period of years, thus have become
                            indispensable elements of the U.S. policies to deter general war and
                            help deter local aggression; to maintain Free World leadership; and to
                            provide the stability and progress in world affairs upon which genuine
                            peace may be established. Failure to maintain technological superiority
                            by the U.S. could result in loss of confidence by the Free World in U.S.
                            technology and power; accelerated Soviet expansion geographically and
                            economically; swing of important uncommitted nations into the Soviet
                            orbit; defection of important countries now members of the Free World
                            community; and attack on the U.S. at such time as Soviet military
                            technology may achieve decisive superiority.</p>
                        <p>11. The scope, complexity and vital importance of the problem of
                            maintaining technological superiority indicate the continuing need to
                            utilize the best in scientific creative talents, both from within and
                            without the government, in reaching for an adequate solution. An example
                            of the value of this broad approach is the report of the <pb xml:id="pg_177" n="177" facs="0201"/>Technological Capabilities

                                <ref target="#d9">Document 9</ref>.</note> Further recognition of
                            the scope of the problem would indicate the desirability of the
                            President having a key Advisor who can assist in correlating and
                            energizing the efforts within the Federal Government to analyze and act
                            upon basic aspects of the problem, and who can keep the President
                            informed on progress. The long-run problem reaches from the educational
                            aspect which involves the very fabric of American society, through the
                            efficient use of resources—money, men and facilities—into the complex of
                            applied research, development and production. Thus the individual
                            selected to advise the President with respect to these problems would
                            need to be an exceptionally gifted individual with a broad, practical
                            background in the scientific, educational and administrative fields.
                            Moreover, his organizational relationship to the President and to the
                            National Security Council should be clearly defined and effectively
                            maintained in order that he may in fact provide the leadership in
                            galvanizing all the resources of the government in the crucial contest
                            for technological superiority.</p>

                        </dateline>
                        <p>This morning, in two successive appointments, first with <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName> and second with
                                <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Arthur Flemming</persName>, the question
                            of our mobilization stock pile was raised. There seems to be some
                            concern as to whether we should not try to economize by cutting back our
                            five year program, on the theory that in a limited war we could get all
                            the strategic materials we needed, while in an all-out war the thing
                            would be over in thirty to sixty days. I declined to cut back the
                            program for two principal reasons.</p>
                        <p>(a). The theory of the thirty to sixty day war has nothing whatsoever to
                            back it up. While it is obvious that in thirty to sixty days the two
                            giants in the atomic field might conceivably accomplish a mutual
                            destruction of terrifying proportions, yet this would not in itself
                            necessarily end the war. Wars are conducted by the will of a population
                            and that will can be at times a most stubborn and practically
                            unconquerable element. In ancient times the final siege of Carthage is
                            an example <pb xml:id="pg_178" n="178" facs="0202"/>—in modern times the
                            1940 bombing of Britain and the 1943–44–45 bombing of Germany are
                            others. Another observation under this same heading is that if our
                            nation would suffer the kind of destruction that we know to be possible
                            today, we could, even if considered militarily victorious, be wholly
                            dependent upon reserve supplies for a matter of several years. This
                            would be particularly true if ports and shipping were destroyed, and if
                            the war encompassed some of the areas from which strategic materials
                            come.</p>
                        <p>(b). The second reason is that I cannot possibly see how the United
                            States can possibly lose anything in storing up imperishable supplies
                            that it does not in itself produce in sufficient quantity. The material
                            resources of the world are constantly being depleted, and at an
                            accelerated pace. The time is bound to come when some of the items will
                            begin to mount sharply in price. Some may even become almost completely
                            exhausted. Only the discovery of substitutes or even changes in the
                            habits of the mode of living of people will provide a long term answer.
                            But the nation that has supplies of presently used scarce materials will
                            obviously have more time to work out this problem than will others. This
                            is the case where the provisioning of war reserves in raw materials does
                            not constitute a drain upon the long term resources of the nation.</p>

                            This action requested the Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization
                            to report on the effects of an assumed period of 3 years, as compared

                            1498–a noted the various recommendations on the subject. <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action No. 1498–b reads as follows:</p>

                            Board to the National Security Council in the case of materials that
                            have a major impact on national security:</p>

                            Although the first few months of conflict may be crucial in determining
                            its outcome, planning for its duration should be based upon all
                            assumptions herein stated, with particular emphasis on Paragraph 18. For

                            a period of five years may be used. However, only the stockpile

                            in Military Mobilization Planning should be completed on a priority

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> reminded the Council that at this
                            season of the year it was customary for the Director of the Budget to
                            discuss briefly with the Council the fiscal and budgetary outlook for
                            the next couple of fiscal years. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRR1">Hughes</persName> would present the estimate, after which Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> would make
                            additional comments.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRR1">Hughes</persName> stood up, placed a
                            chart before the Council, and assured the President that his report
                            would be very short. The President commented that as long as there was a
                            plus on Director <persName corresp="#p_HRR1">Hughes</persName>’ chart,
                            he could sit right down now (laughter).</p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_HRR1">Hughes</persName> analyzed the
                            esimated expenditures and income for the remainder of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956 and for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957, indicating in conclusion that there would be an
                            estimated surplus of $200 million at the end of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956 and of $400 million at the end of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957. However, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRR1">Hughes</persName> warned that the margin between a
                            surplus and a deficit was very close and could easily be upset either by
                            action of the Congress to reduce taxes or action by the Executive Branch
                            in bringing in supplemental budget requests. In short, said Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HRR1">Hughes</persName>, while we were
                            apparently in a good position, we should have to continue to fight in
                            order to maintain this position, and to this end he called for
                            uninterrupted team work.</p>
                        <p>In a philosophical vein, the President said that in the eyes of people
                            like himself, who had been around this town for a long time, we were a
                            “funny bunch”. In the old days, whatever the Executive recommended to
                            the Congress to meet our national defense needs was torn to shreds by
                            the Congress. Now, however, the members of Congress were the experts on
                            how to meet the needs of our national defense. They proceeded to shovel
                            on the money. This, said the President, was a complete reversal of all
                            his earlier experience.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> informed the
                            Council that he was starting right now to work out the 1958 and 1959
                            Defense Department programs. Moreover, he was going to undertake a great
                            innovation. Instead, as in the past, of asking each Service to estimate
                            what it believed it needed to carry out its responsibilities, he was
                            going to give the Services the initial figure. In short, he would ask
                            them to calculate what they could do on the basis of a 5% increase over
                            what they had now and a 5% decrease in funds currently available to
                            them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> then called on Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> to comment on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRR1">Hughes</persName>’ report. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> began by saying with a smile
                            that only the other day, talking with his associates in his office,
                            where there was no danger that the Alsops or Drew Pearson would overhear
                            the conversation, he, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, had said that if we finally succeed in
                            balancing the budget it wouldn’t be our fault. By this, said Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, he meant that we
                            were still increasing the rate <pb xml:id="pg_181" n="181" facs="0205"/>and amount of our military expenditure. What actually looked like a
                            reduction of $1 billion in this area was, so to speak, “a phoney”. As
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> had earlier
                            pointed out, this apparent $1 billion savings had actually been pulled
                            out of accumulated Department of Defense inventory. It was accordingly a
                            one-shot affair. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> then cited similar instances in other programs.
                            Moreover, these programs had absorbed practically every cent that
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> had succeeded in
                            saving. In effect, therefore, what was making possible the balancing of
                            the budget in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956 and 1957 was not a
                            reduction in expenditure but an increase in the Treasury’s income. We
                            are guessing, continued Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, that this increase will continue in the
                            future, but this involves a very risky guess. In any event, we will have
                            a real battle on our hands with respect to the repeal of the excise tax,
                            although the atmosphere in Congress on this issue had improved somewhat
                            of late. With respect to the next fiscal year, we are just comfortably
                            assuming that the present good times and prosperity will continue on,
                            although past experience provides no very good basis for such a cheerful
                            assumption. We can only hope that we are right.</p>
                        <p>(At this point, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General Twining</persName> left the
                            meeting to go to Capitol Hill. Secretary of the Army <persName corresp="#p_BWM1">Brucker</persName> took Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s place at the table, and
                            Admiral Duncan took <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General
                                Twining</persName>’s place.)</p>
                        <p>The President, again in a philosophical vein, said that it was all well
                            and good to deplore spending, as Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> did, but you simply couldn’t sleep at night if
                            you kept deploring something that you really couldn’t help. This country
                            had accustomed itself to lavish spending in certain programs, and it was
                            next to impossible to reverse the trend.</p>
                        <p>With a smile at Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he felt obliged to take exception to
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>’s opening
                            statement, that if we balanced the budget it would not be our own fault.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he would
                            hate to admit, at least in public, that the current good economic
                            conditions in the United States were not the result of the sane fiscal
                            policy pursued by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> and this Administration. Likewise with a smile,
                            the President said they could call him a demagogue if they wanted to,
                            but he certainly proposed to take credit for this prosperity. Surely we
                            have created confidence in the public. This was shown by the behavior of
                            the stock market in relation to the President’s recent illness.</p>

                                prepare a revised presentation on the status of the mobilization

                        </p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of the presentation on the mobilization base which
                            consumed the better part of an hour, the President was the first to
                            speak. He said that it seemed to him that the results of the report on
                            the mobilization base pointed to one very logical conclusion. This was
                            that we should take all feasible measures to protect more effectively
                            the mobilization base which is already in being. This, the President
                            believed, could be accomplished without great additional expenditure. He
                            said he had particularly in mind better protection for the control
                            centers and storage depots of the mobilization base. He also had in mind
                            better protection for the installations at our <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> bases. For a comparatively reasonable cost we could go
                            a long way to assure protection of our mobilization base. Beyond this
                            single conclusion, the President said, it was hard to go because it was
                            so difficult at this time to forsee the type of war which the United
                            States might be obliged to fight in the future. Mobilization planning on
                            the assumption that such a war might not involve the use of nuclear
                            weapons should proceed. On the other hand, mobilization planning should
                            not be carried out to the extent of achieving our complete requirements
                            for either kind of war, that is, general war without nuclear weapons and
                            general war involving their use. The President expressed skepticism of
                            this latter approach and said that our approach should above all be the
                            one which would provide the nation with the greatest possible reactive
                            power. It was foolish to accumulate a lot of military matériel which
                            would gradually become obsolescent. It was very important, however, that
                            we try to cut the ratio of loss for the matériel that we do acquire and
                            store. We should never forget the lesson that modern warfare is a
                            constant practice in improvisation.</p>
                        <p>The President then added that he would very much like to see the
                            appropriate officials in the Pentagon sit down and ponder this problem
                            of the character of a future war. They might first talk about the
                            probabilities, second about the degree of damage the United States was
                            likely to sustain, and third how we can plan without unnecessarily
                            dispersing our efforts. In short, we must get a composite of thinking
                            about the <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">shape</gloss> of a future war and
                            the kind of mobilization base it would require on the most profound and
                            careful basis.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> commented that
                            the presentation just made was designed to indicate where we are now
                            with respect to the mobilization base. He added that he was by no means
                            clearly satisfied with the <pb xml:id="pg_184" n="184" facs="0208"/>existing status. In response the President said he would recall the
                            saying of a very wise German soldier to the effect that all plans in war
                            are worthless but planning itself is invaluable. The President repeated
                            that as he had understood the presentation the amounts required for
                            greater protection and dispersion of the mobilization base would not be
                            tremendously large and furthermore might very well constitute the
                            difference between victory and defeat in a future war. He added his
                            opinion that the United States had never had as able a group of Chiefs
                            of Staff as it now had. Accordingly, the Secretary of Defense should be
                            in a position to have the composite judgment on the required kind of
                            mobilization base that the President had just indicated should be
                            sought.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> then requested
                            that two of the charts previously displayed again be placed on the
                            easel. These were the charts showing transportation losses and “Gross
                            National Product with Projection for Mid-Range Plan Production
                            Requirements”. With these charts in view Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that what we must
                            essentially plan on is how the United States is to survive the initial
                            attack in a future war, particularly how it was to get through the first
                            seven days or so. We must avoid planning to fight a future war along the
                            same lines that we had fought the Second World War.</p>
                        <p>The President interrupted to repeat his conviction that we must promptly
                            get started on measures for further dispersion of our mobilization base
                            facilities and on getting more of these facilities built
                            underground.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> then expressed
                            the opinion that the first objective of the Soviet Union in a future
                            general war would be to separate Western Europe from North America. The
                            President disagreed with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> and said that in his opinion the first Soviet
                            move in such a war would be to try to neutralize the industrial capacity
                            of the United States. The members of the Council indicated general
                            agreement with the President’s view.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> referred to the
                            point made in the course of the presentation that the production of
                            certain vital electronic components was currently concentrated 100 per
                            cent in a single target area. This was such a dangerous situation that
                            Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> said he would
                            like to revive an idea which he had mentioned to the members of the
                            Council at an earlier discussion of the mobilization base. Would it not
                            be possible to take factories and installations such as this and shift
                            them from a target area to coal-mining areas of the United States where
                            at the present time there was a surplus of labor and where such
                            industries would be outside the target area of a Soviet attack. Governor
                                <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> believed that such
                            transfers could be achieved without great cost and expressed the opinion
                            that nothing would do more to discourage an enemy attack on the United
                            States than the knowledge <pb xml:id="pg_185" n="185" facs="0209"/>that
                            our mobilization base and our vital installations were thoroughly
                            dispersed throughout the country. The President expressed sympathy with
                            the objectives sought by Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>’s proposal but pointed out that there would be
                            difficulties in carrying it out because we purchased our military
                            matériel from private firms under contracts.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that in any
                            event the President had put his finger directly on the first course of
                            action we should take, namely, to give increased protection to what we
                            already have available in our mobilization base. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> pointed out that it was much
                            easier to disperse the production of components than it was to disperse
                            large factories and installations. On the whole it would be better to
                            fabricate more items at an efficient price at existing locations than to
                            build additional plants in new locations.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> observed that the
                            enemy would be well aware of those instances where there was 100 per
                            cent production of some vital item concentrated in a single plant
                            because the employees in such a plant were bound to know this fact.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> did not reply
                            further to Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> but
                            said that the first thing he wanted to see happen was to get our basic
                            thinking on the mobilization base sorted out. There were obviously many
                            illogicalities and incongruities in present planning on the mobilization
                            base.</p>
                        <p>Turning to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> the
                            President said that he would like to have Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> get the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                            together with him and talk the whole problem out in some remote place
                            away from the telephones for perhaps two days or for even a week. After
                            such a meeting had reached conclusions as to the desired approach to
                            Government planning and development of the mobilization base, the
                            President said he would like to talk over this conclusion with the
                            Secretary of Defense, [<hi rend="italic">remainder of paragraph (14
                                lines of source text) not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> stated that he
                            nevertheless assumed that the United States mobilization planning should
                            still envisage the possibility of general hostilities occurring outside
                            of the United Sttates, for instance in the Far East. The President told
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> that he ought to
                            plan for full ground mobilization in view of the possibility of the
                            miracle occurring that no nuclear weapons would be used but such
                            planning would not be so detailed or so fully implemented as would be
                            the plans for what we required for the initial phases of a war, that is,
                            for the first seven days or so.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> then said he would
                            like to revert to the point earlier raised by Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>. It seemed terrible that the
                            production of all landing gear for aircraft was concentrated in the city
                            of Cleveland. It certainly should be possible to do something to rectify
                            this situation, perhaps by way of dispersal. The President agreed with
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName>
                            <pb xml:id="pg_186" n="186" facs="0210"/>that close attention should be
                            given to this kind of problem. While manufacturers generally hated to
                            move away from the location where they had long been doing business,
                            General Motors had done it and we ought to try to see what we can do.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that he
                            was pretty well aware of the problem of landing gear production. There
                            would be nothing very difficult in setting up new installations to
                            produce this item in other communities in the event that the city of
                            Cleveland and all the technicians in this industry were to be destroyed
                            in the initial phases of an atomic war. The President replied that if
                            this operation was relatively small and did not cost very much, he did
                            not see why the move could not be made before Cleveland was actually
                            attacked.</p>
                        <p>In summing up the President stated that he was at least certain of one
                            thing: we do have to engage in planning the mobilization base but let us
                            not set up all our priorities on the assumption that we can do
                            everything when we know that a great many things will not be done after
                            the first nuclear strike.</p>

                            each based on a particular assumption as to a condition under which war
                            might develop. The first anticipated no warning until our <gloss target="#t_DEW1">DEW</gloss> line was reached. The second
                            anticipated a month of strategic warning, although without specific
                            information as to when an attack would be launched by the Russians.</p>
                        <p rend="center">I</p>
                        <p>Under the first case, the United States experienced practically total
                            economic collapse, which could not be restored to any kind of operative
                            conditions under six months to a year. Members of the Federal government
                            were wiped out and a new government had to be improvised by the states.
                            Casualties were enormous. It was calculated that something on the order
                            of 65% of the population would require some kind of medical care, and in
                            most instances, no opportunity whatsoever to get it.</p>
                        <p>The limiting factor on the damage inflicted was not so much our own
                            defensive arrangements as the limitations on the Soviet stockpile of
                            atomic weapons in the year ’58.</p>
                        <p>While these things were going on, the damage inflicted by us against the
                            Soviets was roughly three times greater. The picture of total
                            destruction of the areas of lethal fall-out, of serious fall-out and of
                            at least some damage from fall-out, was appalling. Under such an attack,
                            it would be completely impossible for Russia to carry a war on
                            further.</p>
                        <p>For ourselves, it would be clear that there would be no shipping in and
                            out of our country except some small or improvised vessels for many
                            months. It would literally be a business of digging ourselves out of
                            ashes, starting again.</p>
                        <p rend="center">II</p>
                        <p>Under the second case, it was concluded that the major effort of the
                            Soviets would be made against our air bases rather than against the
                            United States alone. Nevertheless, there was no significant difference
                            in the losses we would take.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_188" n="188" facs="0212"/>
                        <p>It was concluded that there was little we could do during the month of
                            warning in the way of dispersal of populations, of industries, or of
                            perfecting defenses that would cut down losses. The only possible way of
                            reducing these losses would be for us to take the initiative some time
                            during the assumed month in which we had the warning of an attack and
                            launch a surprise attack against the Soviets. This would be not only
                            against our traditions, but it would appear to be impossible unless the
                            Congress would meet in a highly secret session and vote a declaration of
                            war which would be implemented before the session was terminated. It
                            would appear to be impossible that any such thing would occur.</p>

                            AND THE CHAIRMAN OF THE ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION</p>
                        <p>Following the briefing above described at ten o’clock this morning,<note n="2" xml:id="d54fn2">No formal briefing report has been found, but
                                see the President’s summary of the briefing, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note> there was some discussion, the substance of
                            which I am setting out in this memorandum for the record.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed some surprise and some doubt about the conclusion
                            in the report that strategic warning contemplated in Plan C would not
                            cut down materially the amount of damage that would result to the United
                            States from the Soviet atomic attack. He said he had believed that with
                            strategic warning we could put ourselves in a position to defend against
                            such an attack, and thus reduce to a greater degree than the report
                            disclosed the amount of damage that would result to the United States.
                            (One of the assumptions made in the report was that in the event that
                            the Russians launched a full scale attack, the nature of the attack on
                            the United States would be to reduce the number of continental targets
                            and emphasize attack on Strategic Air Command bases.)</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_189" n="189" facs="0213"/>
                        <p>The President expressed the opinion that such capabilities as were played
                            into action in the war games supporting the <gloss target="#t_NESC1">NESC</gloss> report would certainly force a deterrent to the
                            initiation of full scale general war with atomic weapons, if nothing
                            else.</p>
                        <p>At this point, General <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">George</persName>
                            expressed the view that in such a situation as that assumed in 1958
                            there could and probably would be room for brush-fire or peripheral
                            clashes, even of rather substantial size, and still not be enough to
                            touch off all-out atomic blows; that in his opinion there would not be
                            such an atomic exchange of blows as that contemplated in the report
                            unless one nation obviously was embarking upon an all-out attack upon
                            the heartland of the other.</p>
                        <p>The President again expressed his astonishment at our inability to defend
                            ourselves better from aerial attack after a strategic warning. He
                            pointed out that the U.S. success in the gaming appeared to lie in the
                            stockpile differential between our assumed stockpile in 1958 and that
                            estimated to be the amount in the Russian stockpile—a differential which
                            the Committee assumed could be as much as 50% off in the estimates. It
                            was pointed out that <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> estimates as to
                            present and future size of Russian stockpiles were assumed to be
                            correct.</p>
                        <p>At this point, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName>
                            made the point that if the size of the Russian stockpile approached
                            parity with ours, the situation would become worse from our standpoint
                            until we entered the phase of optimum or effective utility of
                            thermonuclear weapons by both sides—and all of this short of and before
                            taking into account the situation that would obtain when the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> capability could be attained.</p>
                        <p>The President observed that it was reasonable to assume that the Russians
                            had conducted exercises similar to the <gloss target="#t_NESC1">NESC</gloss> study, and that they had some appreciation of the
                            implications for destruction of their regime and their country as a
                            result of the use of thermonuclear weapons on a strategic scale. He said
                            we had to give them credit for having some sense—that the whole prospect
                            of an exchange of all-out blows with thermonuclear weapons simply
                            staggered the human mind, and that he doubted that the human mind was
                            capable of meeting and dealing with the kind of problems that would be
                            created by such an exchange of blows.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> added that there
                            were many variables in the thing, and that he could not answer a number
                            of questions categorically as to the result of the full-scale use of
                            thermonuclear weapons in general war. He added that in this war gaming
                            exercise, we had, he felt, leaned over backwards to look at the worst
                            situation from our standpoint, and assumed things which might not or
                            would not necessarily have to happen in the event of atomic war. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">George</persName>
                            <pb xml:id="pg_190" n="190" facs="0214"/>expressed disagreement with
                            this thought, and said he felt it had been played out pretty faithfully
                            along the line of a realistic appraisal of what would happen.</p>
                        <p>The President said, assuming that instead of the number of megatons
                            estimated to be delivered on Russia, the amount was only 1/7th of
                            that,—still this is the sort of thing the rational mind could not invite
                            or take steps that might produce it. He went ahead to say he thought the
                            report proved its usefulness, and he felt it was highly desirable to
                            continue making these studies annually, since it kept the intelligence
                            people alert, and needled and alerted the planners as well.</p>
                        <p>He said the thought kept occurring to him that after such an exchange as
                            the games contemplate, it would be a long time before a country so
                            struck would be shipping out any troops to fight any other kind of
                            war.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> expressed the
                            view that the principal role of the Army would under such circumstances
                            be to keep law and order at home. The President said that the report had
                            led him to suspect that little wars in the future would be more apt to
                            be in the form of internal rebellion rather than major external
                            aggression, since the latter would be apt to bring strategic retaliation
                            with thermonuclear weapons.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">George</persName> expressed the view
                            that with the deterrent effect of the realization of what strategic
                            thermonuclear war meant, the nature of warfare beneath such an umbrella
                            would more likely be of the peripheral variety.</p>
                        <p>The President said he drew two further conclusions from the
                            briefing,—first, that both sides would increasingly tend to avoid
                            provoking such a situation as that played out in the war games; in other
                            words, the deterrent against the use of all-out thermonuclear warfare
                            would grow in proportion to the magnitude of the capability; second, he
                            said he was all the more convinced that we could not prepare for little
                            wars at great distances from the United States, and commit several
                            divisions here and several divisions there to resistance against local
                            aggression. Rather, we should trust, he felt, to the kind of major
                            deterrent that the prospect of strategic thermonuclear war would
                            bring.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that this
                            approach might be OK for us but that the people in these little
                            countries who are friends of ours will continue to want to know what
                            will happen if they are attacked. They would, he felt, want to have some
                            tangible evidence that we will be in a position in such an event to come
                            to their rescue and help them defend their countries against external
                            aggression. The President’s response was that these little countries are
                            going to have to be in a position to defend themselves on the ground,
                            depending upon the United States to send in air, naval, and other forms
                            of mobile support.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_191" n="191" facs="0215"/>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">George</persName> said he believed
                            there would never be another Korea, meaning I took it that we would
                            never, under such a policy as the President outlined, undertake to go in
                            with our own ground forces without the willingness to use additional
                            power that nuclear weapons give us to support the indigenous defending
                            ground troops. The President said: “I will never commit our forces to
                            battle where I cannot get at the heart of the enemy’s power and
                            support”. He obviously had reference to the self-imposed limits upon our
                            conduct of the Korean conflict.</p>

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> opened the
                            275th meeting of the National Security Council on February 9 with the
                            following introductory remarks on the ballistic missiles program:</p>
                        <p>“Upon joining the National Security Council at the table, the President
                            said that the members of the Council might be interested in the advice
                            which Bernard Baruch was lavishing on the President with respect to the
                            problem of our ballistic missiles program. The burden of Mr. Baruch’s
                            argument, said the President, could be summarized in three parts: (a) If
                            the Soviet Union succeeds in achieving long-range ballistic missiles
                            before the United States, we will at once lose all our friends and
                            allies, (b) The U.S. can achieve a long-range ballistic missile in a
                            year’s time if we drive hard enough toward that objective, (c) The only
                            effective way to drive at this objective is to appoint a czar over the
                            missiles program who will represent the President directly. The
                            President concluded with the comment that it was surprising what large
                            numbers of people shared these views of Mr. Baruch.” (Memorandum of

                        <p>Bernard M. Baruch was a civic leader and investment banker who had served
                            as chairman of the War Industries Board during World War I, a government
                            consultant during World War II, and United States Representative on the
                            United Nations Atomic Energy Commission in 1946.</p>

                        <p>The first agenda item at the 275th meeting of the National Security
                            Council on February 9 was an oral briefing by <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>. He began as follows:</p>
                        <p>“The Director of Central Intelligence began by stating that it was his
                            understanding that the President had requested a run-down of what he,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>, had said to the
                            committees of Congress when he had briefed these committees with respect
                            to the Soviet ballistic missiles program. The President signified that
                            he wished to have this run-down. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> then
                            stated that on January 19, 1956, he had briefed the members of the
                            Military Applications Subcommittee of the Joint Atomic Energy Committee.
                            He reminded the President that he had discussed this Briefing with him
                            before he had made it, and also stated that the contents of the briefing
                            had been coordinated by the responsible intelligence authorities.
                            Moreover, said Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>, he had done his utmost
                            to protect the sensitive sources of our knowledge of the Soviet missiles
                            program. He then proceeded to describe the main points which he had made
                            in this briefing.</p>
                        <p>“The only other briefing which Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> had made,
                            he said, was to the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Intelligence
                            Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee of the House. This briefing
                            was likewise based on a coordinated intelligence estimate on the subject
                            of the Soviet missiles program.</p>
                        <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> commented,
                            at the conclusion of Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>’ remarks, that
                            certain members of these committees had been told about the sources of
                            U.S. intelligence about Soviet missiles developments. The President
                            said, with a sigh, that he did not know what more we could do to protect
                            ourselves against skunks. If anyone was caught revealing the slightest
                            shred of information about our sources of intelligence on this Soviet
                            program, we ought to get him ’on the trigger’.” (Memorandum of

                            had asked him to give a classified briefing on the Soviet guided missile
                            program. The President then told him not to give this briefing, since,
                            according to <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>, it would
                            inevitably reveal the sources of United States intelligence information
                            about the Soviet program. The President told <persName>Dulles</persName>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. Introduction</p>
                        <p>1. The Planning Board has reviewed <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            5501, “Basic National Security Policy”, and has submitted to the
                            National Security Council the draft revision thereof issued February 8,
                            1956 as <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602.</p>
                        <p>2. The Planning Board’s general conclusions are that certain significant
                            changes in the estimate of the situation have taken place and that such
                            changes call for the proposed revision. These proposals are all within
                            the framework of the basic strategy described in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5501, which in its essential features is believed by
                            the Planning Board to remain valid.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Principal Changes in the Estimate of the
                            Situation</p>
                        <p>1. The U.S. will acquire by about mid-1956 the capability to mount a
                            decisive strike against the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                            will maintain a marked net superiority in nuclear striking power from
                            then until some time in 1958 (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602,
                            Annex, para. 1).</p>
                        <p>2. The steady growth of Soviet military capabilities has continued, and
                            in important instances, particularly in high-yield nuclear weapons,
                            missile development and delivery systems, more rapidly than was
                            estimated a year ago (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602, Annex,
                            paras. 1–6 and 22).</p>
                        <p>3. The growth of Soviet technological capabilities involves a serious
                            short- and long-term challenge, not only in the military area but also
                            in its potential political impact on a world which has in recent years
                            been reassured by the over-all technological predominance of the United
                            States (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602, Annex, para. 12).</p>
                        <p>4. In their efforts to lull and divide the free world and expand their
                            area of influence, the Soviets have added new methods and more flexible
                            tactics, involving the use of trade, barter, and technical assistance,
                            and diplomatic moves including the taking of sides in active <pb xml:id="pg_194" n="194" facs="0218"/>intra-area controversies. Their
                            newer methods are directed toward the progressive erosion of free world
                            will and cohesion (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602, Annex,
                            paras. 20 and 23).</p>
                        <p>5. Increasing U.S. and Soviet nuclear capabilities have produced growing
                            apprehension about the catastrophic nature of general nuclear war
                                (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602, Annex, para. 15).</p>
                        <p>6. U.S. alliances are confronted with new and increasing difficulties in
                            some respects. These strains may become more marked, particularly in
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, where certain countries
                            already evidence (a) greater reluctance to maintain and strengthen
                            military establishments despite increased economic strength, (b)
                            tendencies toward accommodation and disengagement, and (c) more selfish
                            pursuit of national ambitions or rivalries submerged by a sense of
                            common peril and economic weakness (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            5602, Annex, para. 24).</p>
                        <p>7. The underdeveloped areas have become a major target of the new Soviet
                            tactics. Soviet appeals to local aspirations, resentments and fears have
                            been shrewdly combined to foster trends toward neutralism and enhance
                            vulnerability to communist influence (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602, Annex, paras. 16, 17 and 18).</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. Basic U.S. National Strategy</p>
                        <p>1. The basic national strategy outlined in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5501 (Section B) remains generally valid and sound for
                            the situation we face.</p>
                        <p>2. Within this framework, however, the present situation requires
                            additional effort in carrying out certain basic security programs and
                            some significant shifts in emphasis as to others, in pursuing this
                            general strategy.</p>
                        <p>3. Hence it is recommended that the Council, in reviewing basic national
                            security policy, schedule a further and subsequent review of certain
                            essential elements of national strategy to ensure that they are being
                            carried out with the effectiveness, urgency and resources called for
                            under present world conditions.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">IV. Recommendations for Special <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Review</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The U.S. Approach to the Underdeveloped Nations</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>a. Paragraphs 19 to 30 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602
                            restate the importance of the underdeveloped areas and the need for a
                            more flexible U.S. political and economic approach and for broad and
                            adaptable programs of U.S. assistance.</p>
                        <p>b. The current Communist political, economic and diplomatic offensive,
                            involving widespread offers of technical, developmental and military
                            assistance on a “trade not aid” basis, both bilaterally and through UN
                            agencies, confronts the United States with one of its most serious
                            challenges. Despite substantial assistance programs, the United States
                                <pb xml:id="pg_195" n="195" facs="0219"/>has not succeeded to date
                            in developing an affirmative sense of community of interests with the
                            underdeveloped countries. Hence their complex drives for improved
                            conditions and status are effectively exploited by the new Communist
                            offensive.</p>
                        <p>c. It is recommended that the Council, after submission to the President
                            of the report on the subject now in preparation by the Chairman, Council
                            on Foreign Economic Policy,<note n="3" xml:id="d57fn3">Not further
                                identified.</note> give further consideration to basic U.S. policies
                            with respect to the less developed and uncommitted areas.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Flexibility and Mobility of U.S. Military
                                Capabilities</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>a. Policies dealing with the capabilities and use of U.S. military forces
                            required to deter or defeat Communist military aggression in its various
                            forms are treated in paragraphs 9 to 17 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602.</p>
                        <p>b. In particular, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602, like <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5501, emphasizes the need for flexible
                            capabilities to deter or defeat local aggression by selective means
                            which (a) are appropriate to the character and extent of the enemy
                            action, and (b) can be brought to bear speedily and in a way best
                            calculated to avoid the broadening of hostilities into general war. This
                            matter raises the issue of the mobility and deployment of forces and the
                            degree of their dependence on nuclear weapons in such situations.</p>
                        <p>c. In order to assist the Council in assessing these issues, it is
                            recommended that the Council request the Department of Defense to make a
                            presentation on the capabilities, with or without nuclear weapons, of
                            the U.S. military forces referred to in paragraph 32 and other
                            appropriate paragraphs of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5501, to
                            deal with local aggression in Vietnam, utilizing as appropriate a study

                        <p>a. The Soviet Union is making rapid strides in weapons systems, in basic
                            science and research and in non-military fields, and is overtaking the
                            United States in the education and training of scientific and technical
                            personnel. The proposed policy to deal with this problem is contained in
                            paragraphs 18 and 49 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5.602.</p>

                            to make a presentation to the Council on the problem of technological
                                superiority.<note n="5" xml:id="d57fn5">See <ref target="#d62fn11">footnote 11, Document 62</ref>.</note>

                        </p>
                        <p>The President did not know of any way to avoid criticism in a political
                            year. He wanted to point out, however, that there was no certain
                            knowledge that the Soviets were able to develop yet a warhead
                            sufficiently light to be carried on a missile. It was important too to
                            remember that there already existed more certain methods of delivering
                            weapons to the saturation point than through the use of missiles. But he
                            did not want to belittle the importance of missiles for there was
                            obviously a large psychological factor among our allies to be considered
                            in regard to the Russian potential for shooting even a 1500-mile
                            missile.</p>
                        <p>The President stated that the United States is rushing missile
                            development, that the budget contains a request for $1.2 billion. He
                            noted the suggestion for setting up a separate agency, but said that he
                            would use instead the experience of all the agencies. He did see a need
                            for a good man to be located in the Department of Defense to see to the
                            coordination of a lot of this.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_197" n="197" facs="0221"/>
                        <p>The President recalled that our experts had originally believed that the
                            quickest intercontinental missile to be had was of the “flight” type
                            rather than the ballistics type, though of course it would be more
                            vulnerable to destruction than the ballistics type.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Reuben Robertson</persName> recalled
                            that in the economizing of 1.948, work on the missile was cut out
                            entirely, that the Defense Department funds were sharply reduced and
                            that air research funds were cut from $185 million to $145 million.</p>
                        <p>The President stated that he had been coming down from Columbia at that
                            time to consult, and when he was told that the expenditure program was
                            going to be reduced below a certain point, he just couldn’t have any
                            further part in it.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President was certain that the missile program was on a
                            starvation diet until this Administration came along, but he was not
                            proposing to play politics with this unless forced into the subject by
                            the opposition.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> said that missiles
                            were starved until Korea when money became available, and Mr.
                                Keller<note n="3" xml:id="d58fn3">Kaufman T. Keller, former Special
                                Assistant to the Secretary of Defense, Director of Guided Missiles,
                                1954.</note> came in to “beef up” the program of those missiles that
                            were nearly ready for production. The strategic missiles were not
                            “beefed up” until the 1953 study<note n="4" xml:id="d58fn4">Not further
                                identified.</note> by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_VNJ1">Von
                                Neumann</persName> and others. Since then, this Administration has
                            pumped money in as fast as it can be used, as even Trevor Gardner has
                            admitted.</p>
                        <p>The President noted again that as far as Russia is concerned, all that is
                            known is that they have propelled something a given distance. How far
                            along they are with warhead and guidance systems is not known.</p>
                        <p>Ironically, the President said, he thought he would be hard pressed to
                            justify putting so much money into missiles, only to find that newcomers
                            appear and charge him with not doing enough.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> branded as inaccurate
                            and very dangerous the concept of an “ultimate weapon.” As for the talk
                            about the Russians having the intermediate range missile, they already
                            had the IL-28’s which are more effective than missiles and cannot
                            adequately be defended against. We know that and the Russians know it,
                            he said.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> emphasized that the
                            Russians will still be deterred by our power to strike an effective blow
                            whether with missiles or otherwise.</p>
                        <p>The President commented on the vast number of missiles needed to make an
                            effective attack on many cities—allowing for some being defective.
                            Inability to pinpoint would require large numbers and the <pb xml:id="pg_198" n="198" facs="0222"/>world would be a shambles
                            before an atomic war was over. War up to now has been a contest, he
                            said; but with nuclear missiles, it is no longer a contest, it is
                            complete destruction.</p>
                        <p>The President said he did want to get guided missiles as quickly as
                            possible for the sake of our friends. But in the meantime we have a
                            deterrent power—which we’ve got to have for the sake of civilization.
                            That’s why he talked disarmament so much, he said.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> noted that the
                            “business as usual” charge just wasn’t true. He pointed out that 25,000
                            people, of whom 10,000 are scientists, are working on the program, and
                            more than 50,000 hours of overtime are being worked which is said to be
                            the maximum for a program of long duration. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> added that overtime had been
                            authorized even before the President’s “highest priority” determination,
                            and that unlimited overtime is now authorized.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> said Mr. Trevor
                            Gardner’s concern was not with ballistic missiles, for which he said
                            himself he couldn’t use any more money; he was concerned rather with the
                            broad area of air research and development.</p>
                        <p>The President remarked that he had just been reminded of a talk he had
                            had with Sec. Talbott who had been keen for appointing Gardner. His file
                            also held a note about several Senators (<persName corresp="#p_KWF1">Knowland</persName> included) cautioning against it. The President
                            said he finally had told them to go ahead if they insisted but they
                            would have to hold themselves responsible if it proved to be a
                            mistake.</p>

                            Security Council the views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff with respect to

                            </note> I concur in these views.</p>
                        <p>2. <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602 was the subject of a special
                            meeting of the Armed Forces Policy Council on 23 February. Because I
                            shall not be at the National Security Council meeting when <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602 is discussed, I should like to use
                            this opportunity to call the attention of the members of the Council to
                            the general conclusions of the discussion in the Armed Forces Policy
                            Council. It was our unanimous view that, while <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602 is some small improvement in detail over <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5501, its predecessor, it does not
                            represent the incisive and clear statement of the basic U.S. security
                            policies which we believe is needed to meet the challenge of new Soviet
                            moves. We feel that, since <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5501 was
                            approved, the Soviets have made much progress. Their military strength
                            is rapidly becoming more than adequate to make them feel that their
                            basic objectives of protecting the security of their regime and of
                            holding together the Soviet Communist Bloc are now well assured. In
                            consequence, we feel that they are moving with far greater flexibility
                            and assurance to isolate the U.S. from the rest of the free world and to
                            create doubts in the minds of our allies as to U.S. intentions.</p>
                        <p>3. In the face of this considerably changed situation, we strongly
                            recommend, whether or not it is desired to act on <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602 in its present form, that a number
                            of very fundamental problems confronting us should be thrashed out by a
                            small group meeting with the President. On the basis of such discussions
                            and a consequent clarification of the bases of new policy and national
                            strategy, we feel there <pb xml:id="pg_200" n="200" facs="0224"/>should
                            then be produced for <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> consideration a
                            much shorter, positive and affirmative statement of U.S. policy to meet
                            the challenge of the new Soviet cold war offensive.</p>

                        <p>1. The Joint Chiefs of Staff forward in the Enclosure<note n="2" xml:id="d60fn2">Not printed.</note> hereto their comments on <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602. They consider that these
                            comments, if adopted, will clarify certain important aspects of this
                            paper.</p>
                        <p>2. The Joint Chiefs of Staff are, however, more concerned with the
                            over-all aspects of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602 which in
                            their opinion is in essence a restatement of the Basic National Security
                            Policy as contained in both <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5501 and
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2.<note n="3" xml:id="d60fn3">For text of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>

                                577.</note> They feel strongly that there has been a marked
                            deterioration of the Free World position in the past year, due mainly to
                            a new and more flexible approach on the part of the Communist Bloc
                                (<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>). Unless U.S. policy is
                            realistically revised to meet the new Soviet tactics, U.S. leadership of
                            the Free World will be jeopardized.</p>
                        <p>3. Accordingly, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that, regardless of
                            action taken by the National Security Council on <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602, a complete restudy of the Basic National Security
                            Policy be made as a matter of urgency.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName> began his
                            briefing of the Council by inviting its attention to the Annex to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602, which contained the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning Board’s current “Estimate of
                            the Situation”. He commented on the several paragraphs until he reached
                            paragraph 3. As to paragraph 3, respecting the “Chances of General War”,
                            he pointed out that the Joint Chiefs of Staff wished to insert an
                            additional sentence elaborating on the possibility of war occurring as a
                            result of miscalculation on one side or the other.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that he could not see any essential difference
                            between the sentence which the Planning Board had originally included on
                            this point and the added language recommended by the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> explained
                            that the Joint Chiefs believed that the danger of war by miscalculation
                            was a consideration which could not be too strongly emphasized. The
                            President then suggested that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                            sentence be included.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> continued his briefing of the remaining
                            paragraphs in the Annex and, when he had concluded his briefing of the
                            estimate of the situation, inquired as to whether there were any
                            questions.</p>
                        <p>The President said he had an observation to make. He said he believed
                            that we were inclined to use the word “neutrality” too loosely, as this
                            estimate of the situation itself demonstrated. He explained that it was
                            erroneous for people to charge that there could be no genuine neutrality
                            in the world between the Communist and the Western nations. He reminded
                            the Council that the United States itself had pursued a policy of
                            genuine neutrality for the first 150 years of its life. In any event the
                            United States, thought the President, must not keep seeking to achieve
                            military as opposed to moral commitments from other nations. Those
                            nations which made military commitments <pb xml:id="pg_202" n="202" facs="0226"/>to the United States often made themselves highly
                            vulnerable to Communist attack. The President then very forcefully
                            stated that we should define the term “neutrality” more precisely. It
                            should mean a moral, spiritual and, possibly, a political commitment to
                            our side, but not necessarily a military commitment. Mr.
                                <persName>Anderson</persName> assured the President that the view he
                            had expressed had been set forth in paragraph 29 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> said that while the
                            Council was still considering the estimate in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602, he would like to raise a question with respect to
                            the last two sentences in the memorandum which Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> had sent to the Council
                            containing the views of the Defense Department and the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff with respect to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602. These
                            last two sentences stressed the growing military strength of the Soviet
                            Union, and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> wished to
                            know whether these sentences in point of fact took issue with the
                            Estimate of the Situation in the Annex which the Council had just gone
                            over.</p>
                        <p>The President replied to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> by stating that the view taken of Soviet
                            strength in Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s
                            memorandum was generally true. The Soviets, continued the President,
                            were holding their coalition together at the present time by quite
                            different means because they had come to believe that it would be
                            impossible to hold this coalition together solely by military force as
                            in the past. He saw nothing really to challenge in Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s estimate. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> also stated that these
                            views of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> were in
                            line with the latest coordinated intelligence estimate of Soviet
                            intentions and capabilities.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> stated that if there were no more
                            questions about the estimative section of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602, he would turn to the body of the report, dealing
                            with U.S. policy and strategy vis-à-vis the Soviet Union. He referred
                            first to the Preamble on page 1, which he indicated was new and was
                            designed by the Planning Board to suggest an affirmative approach to the
                            problem of the Soviet Union rather than a reactive approach. The
                            President said he could see nothing to object to in the Preamble, and
                            that in fact he liked it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> then resumed his comments on the
                            successive paragraphs of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602,
                            pointing out that with respect to paragraph 6 the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                            had recommended the deletion of the parenthetical phrase “including
                            safeguarded disarmament”. The President commented that this seemed a
                            very important matter, and deletion of the phrase might appear to be
                            deliberate. Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>
                            expressed the feeling that the phrase should be retained because
                            disarmament was a basic way for the United States to try to reduce the
                            Soviet threat, the more so because we had ruled out war as such a means.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he didn’t
                            think it was vital one way or another, but inasmuch <pb xml:id="pg_203" n="203" facs="0227"/>as the phrase was already in the paper, it
                            might just as well remain. The President said that the phrase should
                            stay, at least tentatively.</p>
                        <p>When Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> had reached paragraph 7, dealing
                            with the requirements for a flexible combination of military, political,
                            economic, and other actions as a prerequisite of U.S. strategy,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> indicated that
                            he wished to make a point. He said that he had no doubt that we could
                            achieve a certain flexibility in carrying out our military, political,
                            and economic actions; but we desperately needed more flexibility within
                            the Executive Branch to deal with the problem of countering Soviet
                            initiatives. Our procedures and our relations with the Congress were too
                            slow and cumbersome. The President indicated that the point that
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had made could
                            be raised at the appropriate stage in the Council’s consideration of
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602.</p>
                        <p>Coming to paragraphs 11 and 12, dealing with the policies of the United
                            States to integrate nuclear weapons with other weapons and also with
                            chemical, bacteriological and radiological weapons, Mr.
                                <persName>Anderson</persName> said he would read these paragraphs in
                            their entirety because they were new. Having done so, Mr.
                                <persName>Anderson</persName> indicated that the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff had recommended a change in the second sentence of paragraph 11.
                            This now read “Nuclear weapons will be used in general war and in
                            military operations short of general war as authorized by the
                            President.” The Joint Chiefs had suggested that the sentence should read
                            as follows: “Nuclear weapons will be used in general war and will be
                            used in military operations short of general war when the effectiveness
                            of the operations of the U.S. forces employed will be enhanced thereby.
                            For such operations, the decision as to specific uses will be made by
                            the President.” Since the Joint Chiefs of Staff had not, as they usually
                            did, given the reasons behind their proposed change, Mr.
                                <persName>Anderson</persName> asked Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> if he would speak to the
                            point.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> said he would be
                            very glad to comment. There seemed, he said, to be a widespread
                            impression that nuclear weapons were designed only for offensive use. In
                            point of fact, however, these weapons affected our defensive strength
                            just as much as our offensive strength. He cited various weapons to
                            illustrate this assertion. Accordingly, continued Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>, it would make a tremendous
                            difference defensively if our U.S. forces could not use nuclear weapons
                            in order to defend themselves. It was his opinion that nuclear weapons
                            would soon be so thoroughly integrated in the U.S. armed forces that
                            inability to use these weapons would greatly reduce both our defensive
                            and offensive capabilities. Indeed, the idea of some dividing line
                            between use and non-use of these weapons was getting us further and
                            further from the realm of the possible and the actual.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_204" n="204" facs="0228"/>
                        <p>In response to Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>,
                            the President adverted to the political implications in the use of
                            nuclear weapons. In these peripheral or small wars which we are talking
                            about, the United States might become involved, for example, through the
                            United Nations. If this occurred, the use of nuclear weapons would raise
                            serious political problems in view of the current state of world opinion
                            as to the use of such weapons. While, said the President, he agreed
                            emphatically with Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> from a strictly military point of view, we could
                            nevertheless not ignore the political factor. He did not say that world
                            opinion was right in its views about the use of nuclear weapons in small
                            wars. It was nevertheless a fact, and the President predicted that it
                            would be some considerable time before the United States reaches a point
                            where it can adopt any military course of action it regards as
                            appropriate without regard for the political repercussions of such a
                            course of action.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he
                            believed he had an idea which might reconcile the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and the Planning Board language in
                            paragraph 11. Could we not, he asked, use a slightly different formula
                            to cover the use of nuclear weapons in general war and in operations
                            short of general war? He said he had no objection to the use of the
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> language with respect to general
                            war, but he preferred the language suggested by the Planning Board with
                            regard to operations short of general war.</p>
                        <p>The President said that having taken one position in response to Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>’s views, he was now
                            about to take a quite different position in response to the point raised
                            by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>. He asked
                            that the Council imagine the position of a military commander in the
                            field. His radar informs him that a flock of enemy bombers is on the
                            point of attacking him. What does the military commander do in such a
                            contingency? Does he not use every weapon at hand to defend himself and
                            his forces?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> responded by
                            insisting that the language proposed by the Joint Chiefs was no more
                            responsive to the situation described by the President than was the
                            language of the Planning Board, inasmuch as the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> language itself called for approval of specific use of
                            atomic weapons by the President. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> agreed, however, that the United States forces
                            would make use of nuclear weapons if these forces were directly attacked
                            by the enemy. The President thought that this point should be made
                            specific in the statement of policy.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> commented that in
                            the event of an attack on our forces by an enemy using nuclear weapons,
                            such U.S. defensive forces might suffer such severe initial defeat that
                            they would be unable to <pb xml:id="pg_205" n="205" facs="0229"/>recover
                            and go on to victory. In such a case you would have to use nuclear
                            weapons for defense. The President stated his agreement with the point
                            made by Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that he
                            wished to raise the very important point of the costs of our preparation
                            for war. He said that it was impossible to prepare dual methods of
                            fighting a future war. Accordingly, we have got to use nuclear weapons
                            in the event of a future war. When you talked in a policy [paper] about
                            “maybe you will use them, maybe you won’t”, you were getting into very,
                            very deep water. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            said that it appeared that we must choose between having all the
                            military flexibility we wished and losing all our allies. The automatic
                            employment of nuclear weapons in certain instances would surely cost us
                            our allies. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said
                            he would freely admit that we must do more to educate our allies on our
                            position, but that a decision now in favor of automatic use of these
                            weapons might actually prove disastrous to the United States.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that we were now talking chiefly of defensive
                            nuclear weapons. It would be well to remember that current U.S. forces
                            have in every case at least some capability with so-called conventional
                            weapons. What we are seeking now, in connection with paragraph 11, is
                            language which will state that we can use any weapon available to us in
                            the event that our forces are directly attacked by the enemy. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> agreed with the
                            President.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> said he
                            wished to refer to the point earlier made by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> with respect to the
                            impossibility of preparing to fight two kinds of wars. He added that the
                            Defense Department felt a very great need for Council guidance as to the
                            manner in which preparation for future war should be made. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> then referred to
                            the footnote at the bottom of page 6 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602, in which the State Department proposed an
                            additional paragraph to be inserted after paragraph 12 and to read as
                            follows: “If time permits, the United States should consult appropriate
                            allies, including <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, before the
                            final decision to use nuclear and chemical, bacteriological, and
                            radiological weapons is made by the President.”<note n="5" xml:id="d61fn5">In a memorandum to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, dated February 24,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> recommended that
                                the final clause of this sentence should be redrafted to read:
                                “before <hi rend="italic">any</hi> final decision to use nuclear <hi rend="italic">or</hi> chemical, bacteriological, <hi rend="italic">or</hi> radiological weapons is made by the

                                are printed in italics. (Department of State, <gloss target="#t_PPS1">PPS</gloss> Files: Lot 66 D 487, <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss> Chron. TS)</note> In addition to the
                            qualification proposed by the State Department, “if time permits,”
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> suggested
                            the qualification “and if an attack on U.S. forces is not involved”. The
                            President said he thought very well of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName>’s proposal.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_206" n="206" facs="0230"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he would
                            like to pursue the discussion a little further. Suppose we turned our
                            attention to the situation in Berlin. What happens if the Soviets impose
                            a new blockade on Berlin? As the Council knew, it was agreed U.S. policy
                            in this contingency to attempt to push through such a blockade. [<hi rend="italic">remainder of paragraph (4 lines of source text) not

                        <p>At this point the President suggested that the Council suspend action in
                            paragraphs 11 and 12 until such time as it should receive the new paper
                            of the Joint Chiefs of Staff dealing with these problems.<note n="6" xml:id="d61fn6">Not found in the Eisenhower Library or Department of
                                State files.</note> Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> said he supported the position taken by
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, as opposed to
                            the position taken by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> added a warning of the terrible repercussions
                            which we would experience if we had recourse to the use of nuclear
                            weapons against the colored peoples of Asia.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName> asked permission
                            to speak at this point. He said he would simply like to add, for the
                            information of the Council, that we have at present no radiological
                            weapons and, as far as he knew, no requirement for them.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> said he would like to
                            refer once again to the memorandum sent to the Council by Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> together with the
                            views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. As he understood Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s position in this memorandum,
                            the Secretary had concluded that the policy set forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602 did not represent the kind of
                            policy the United States required in the face of the existing situation.
                            Was the issue which the Council had been discussing, with respect to
                            paragraph 11, an illustration of what the Defense Department and the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff had in mind when they said that we should have a
                            more incisive and specific policy statement than that contained in
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602? Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> replied that this was
                            precisely the type of problem about which the Defense Department
                            believed there was need for much clearer delineation of U.S. policy.</p>
                        <p>At this point Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            again suggested that the best solution for the problem raised in
                            paragraph 11 would be for the Council provisionally to adopt the
                            language suggested by the Joint Chiefs of Staff with respect to the use
                            of weapons in general war, and the language proposed by the Planning
                            Board with respect to the use of nuclear weapons in operations short of
                            general war. We should also add, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, words to indicate that these
                            concepts needed further elaboration and that we should have a study of
                            them by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_207" n="207" facs="0231"/>
                        <p>In response to this suggestion, the President again stated that Council
                            action on paragraphs 11 and 12 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            5602 should be held in abeyance pending receipt of this study by the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff. There was no need, thought the President, for
                            immediate Council action on <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            5602.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName> then undertook
                            to explain to the National Security Council the origin and development
                            of the ideas and language in paragraph 11. He pointed out that a high
                            level committee had been set up in the Department of Defense which was
                            called the “<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5501 Committee”. This
                            Defense Department committee had initially decided on appropriate
                            language to cover the problem of the use of nuclear weapons. They had
                            thereafter sent this language to the Planning Board for its
                            consideration, and this language had been adopted with some few changes
                            by the Planning Board. Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> indicated,
                            however, that the Planning Board had had no knowledge of the special
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> study of this problem to which
                            reference had been made in the course of the discussion. He wondered
                            whether this problem should not be added to the other major problems set
                            forth in the covering memorandum by the Planning Board to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602, which problems the Planning Board
                            felt should be the subject of further study and consideration by the
                            National Security Council.</p>
                        <p>The President then observed that the Joint Chiefs of Staff should have
                            reported the contents of their study of the use of nuclear weapons prior
                            to the time when the Planning Board had reached its decision as to
                            appropriate language for paragraph 11. In other words, said the
                            President, turning to Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName>, you and the
                            Planning Board were under the impression that paragraphs 11 and 12, as
                            agreed upon by the Planning Board, were acceptable to the Department of
                            Defense and to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Mr.
                                <persName>Anderson</persName> nodded agreement, but Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> insisted that the
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> recommendation as to the
                            language which the Planning Board should use for paragraph 11 was the
                            same language which they were now proposing as a substitute for the
                            existing Planning Board language. In point of fact, the Planning Board
                            had not accepted the original <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                            suggestions and had changed them in the course of its deliberations. Mr.
                                <persName>Anderson</persName> agreed that this was correct, but
                            pointed out that the Defense member and the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> adviser of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            Planning Board had agreed to accept the revision made by the Planning
                            Board in the language originally sent by the Joint Chiefs for inclusion
                            in paragraph 11.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> said he wished to
                            raise a question with respect to paragraph 12, regarding chemical,
                            bacteriological, and radiological weapons in general war. He asked
                            whether he was correct in believing that our previous policy had been
                            that we would have recourse to such weapons only in retaliation against
                            their use by an enemy. Did the present language of paragraph 12 thus
                            amount to a change in policy <pb xml:id="pg_208" n="208" facs="0232"/>respecting the use of such weapons? The President commented that the
                            chief purpose of paragraph 12 was to encourage research and development
                            in these weapons fields. Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> added that
                            previous policy respecting the use of these weapons called for their use
                            only in retaliation. Accordingly Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName>’s surmise was correct, and the present
                            paragraph 12 constituted a change in our policy.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then asked the
                            President whether Council action on paragraphs 11 and 12 was to be held
                            in suspense. The President indicated that paragraph 12 was OK as
                            written, but that Council action on paragraph 11 would be suspended
                            pending further study and report to the Council by the Department of
                                Defense.<note n="7" xml:id="d61fn7">See <ref target="#d62fn9">footnote 9, Document 62</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> then moved on and called the Council’s
                            attention to paragraph 13. He explained that the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                            desired to add language to this paragraph which would delineate the
                            roles of the Army and the Navy in a future war. So far as he could
                            ascertain, Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> said, he believed the
                            Planning Board entertained no objection to the additions proposed by the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                        <p>The President said that of course this raised a problem. When you
                            inserted language such as was proposed by the Joint Chiefs in this
                            paragraph, the paragraph became almost a military directive and carried
                            with it the assumption that you had the military capabilities called for
                            by the directive. The President said that he believed that in a future
                            nuclear war the chief task of the U.S. ground forces would be to
                            preserve order in the United States. God only knew what the Navy would
                            be doing in a nuclear attack. The President indicated that he was
                            opposed to adding language which was suggestive of a military
                            directive.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> expressed very
                            great concern over the proposed new language. He inquired whether the
                            National Security Council was not now trying to avoid so far as possible
                            all duplication in war planning and all duplication for expenditures to
                            meet a future war. It seemed to him that the Council was at long last
                            reaching the point of decision as to the use of nuclear weapons in a
                            future war. He went on to point out how greatly those who sat around
                            this table had changed their views on this subject over the last two
                            years. Acceptance of the proposed <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                            additions might readily involve several billions of dollars in
                            additional appropriations for the Army and Navy and this drastically
                            upset the balance that we were now attaining between our economic
                            well-being and our military preparedness. Accordingly, paragraph 13 and
                            the problems it raised represented to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> “the whole ball of wax” and
                            “the real meat of the coconut”.</p>

                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> pointed out that
                            the language describing the missions of the Army and the Navy was a
                            quotation from a letter written by the President to the Secretary of
                            Defense last January.<note n="8" xml:id="d61fn8">Reference is to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s letter to

                                in which the President wrote in part: “Other essential tasks during
                                the initial period following a possible future attack would require
                                the Navy to clear the ocean lanes, and the Army to do its part in
                                meeting critical land situations.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers

                                    1956,</hi> p. 4 ) The Joint Chiefs repeated this sentence
                                verbatim in paragraph 1–c of the enclosure, not printed, attached to
                                the memorandum to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, <hi rend="italic">supra.</hi>
                            </note> He added that all the interested bodies and groups among the
                            military were interested in getting such language in our basic policy
                            paper as a means of protecting their appropriations. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said he agreed heartily with
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> that what was
                            proposed by the Army and the Navy constituted appropriations
                            language.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> said he would
                            like to comment on the charge of too much specificity in the proposed
                            language for paragraph 13. He said that the additional language proposed
                            by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, detailed as it was, was presented on the
                            assumption that the policy set forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602 would be satisfactory. If the Council were to
                            adopt a quite different policy, as Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> suggested in his memorandum, less detail would be
                            required.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> commented that
                            the additional language proposed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff for
                            paragraph 13, as to the missions of the Army and the Navy, was designed
                            simply to involve the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> in a decision
                            as to the missions of the different branches of the armed forces, and
                            might very well be used as a basis for asking much larger
                            appropriations.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> said he wanted to
                            emphasize and underline what Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> had said with regard to the necessity for a
                            decision on the use of nuclear weapons. This issue, he added, had very
                            great implications for our mobilization base. He added, however, that he
                            did not agree with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s idea that a new and more incisive policy paper
                            should be developed. We should instead attempt to make <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602 more incisive and satisfactory.
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> stated that what
                            the Joint Chiefs of Staff had in mind was a new policy paper to replace
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602.</p>
                        <p>The President then turned to Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> and said that if the suggestions of the Army and
                            the Navy were accepted, we would be writing into paragraph 13 exactly
                            what we expected the Army and Navy to be doing at the outbreak and
                            initial stages of a future war. He again stressed that he did not
                            believe that language suitable for war plans was likewise suitable for
                            basic national security policy, and the language proposed by the Army
                            and Navy seemed to him language suited to a war plan. A basic policy
                            paper is not a war plan.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_210" n="210" facs="0234"/>
                        <p>After Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> had pointed out that the present
                            text of paragraph 13 was almost identical with the corresponding
                            paragraph in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5501, General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> inquired whether the Council
                            would like to have him state the reason why the Army had recommended,
                            and he had supported, the inclusion of language describing the mission
                            of U.S. ground forces. He had supported this language, said General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>, because
                            approximately 40% of our ground forces would be fighting for their lives
                            abroad while the air atomic war was going on. He believed that due
                            recognition should be given to this fact, and said that in all
                            probability the Chief of Naval Operations felt similarly about the role
                            of the U.S. Navy.</p>
                        <p>The President replied by pointing out that our air atomic capability
                            constituted in the first instance the great deterrent to war.
                            Accordingly, it was in a quite different category from the problem of
                            where our ground forces and our ships were to be deployed in the event
                            of war. If we start now specifying precisely what our Army and Navy are
                            going to do, we’ll never stop.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that it
                            seemed to him that paragraph 13 was dealing primarily with the problem
                            of how you fight a war. These two ideas were separate and distinct, and
                            should not be combined in a single paragraph. The President then
                            indicated that the Council should go on to the next paragraph, and that
                            he was not at the moment inclined toward inclusion of the additional
                            language suggested by the Joint Chiefs of Staff for paragraph 13. Before
                            the Council moved on, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> secured agreement to certain changes in the
                            language of the footnote on page 6.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> then went on with his briefing, and
                            invited the Council’s attention to paragraph 14, which dealt with the
                            problem of U.S. military forces required to meet or to deter local
                            Communist aggression. He pointed out that in the Planning Board’s
                            covering memorandum a recommendaton had been made that the Department of
                            Defense make a special presentation on the subject of our capabilities
                            to deter or prevent such aggression in Vietnam. The Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff had concurred in this recommendation.</p>
                        <p>When Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> had finished reading paragraph 14,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> commented
                            that the Defense Department felt very much about paragraph 14 as they
                            had felt about paragraph 11, which seemed to be looking at peripheral
                            and general war together.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he again found himself a little puzzled about the
                            use and implication of the words “peripheral war”. He reminded the
                            Council that when his Administration had first come into office, back in
                            January of 1953, our big complaint was the Korean war, which we were
                            obliged to fight with handcuffs on. Under the circumstances, we could
                            not win such a war, and that left us no option but to end the war. Then
                            the President said that the point that he was <pb xml:id="pg_211" n="211" facs="0235"/>trying to make was that in the future these
                            peripheral wars must not be permitted to drag out. We must now plan to
                            fight peripheral wars on the same basis as we would fight a general war.
                            After all, there was no good reason for drawing distinctions between
                            peripheral and general wars. Had we not made up our minds that if the
                            Communists renewed their aggression against Korea we would go “all out”
                            to meet it?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> put to the
                            President the question of what we would do if the Vietminh undertook to
                            attack South Vietnam. Would we proceed to drop atomic bombs on Peking?
                            The President replied that we might not drop bombs on Peking, but just
                            as quickly as the Communists intervened against South Vietnam we would
                            certainly bomb the bases in China which were supporting the
                            aggression.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that this
                            discussion again pointed to the necessity that the National Security
                            Council reach a unanimous decision on what kind of a war the United
                            States was going to be prepared to fight if it occurred. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> said that in a kind of a
                            way a peripheral war was now going on in Laos. The President said,
                            however, that the kind of war we were talking about was one in which the
                            United States was intervening. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that by the terms of the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> treaty the United States was
                            committed to protect the territorial integrity of Laos.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> again pointed out the Planning Board
                            recommendation that the Department of Defense should produce a full
                            study and presentation of the problem of local aggression to the
                            National Security Council. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> commented that the Planning Board recommendation
                            was all right with him, though he doubted that it would be very
                            productive. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>
                            said with considerable warmth that it was simply not possible for the
                            United States to fight just little wars. If we get into any war at all
                            we must go in with the determination to clean the whole mess up. Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> added that at any
                            rate we could not let such little wars drag on.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> reminded the
                            Council of his view that if the free world came to believe that the
                            United States was only capable of fighting with nuclear weapons, we
                            would lose much of our free world support. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> took issue with this view, and
                            pointed out that the Council adopted two years ago a policy of building
                            up the nuclear capabilities of our armed forces and, moreover, he
                            predicted that the use of these nuclear weapons would become accepted
                            throughout the world just as soon as people could lay their hands upon
                            them. The President concluded the discussion by calling for agreement on
                            the Planning Board’s recommendation for a study and presentation to the
                            Council of the local aggression problem.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_212" n="212" facs="0236"/>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> asked if the Council
                            would go back for a moment to paragraph 13. He believed that it would be
                            useful to change the introductory phrase “As part of its military forces
                            the United States must develop and maintain its effective nuclear
                            retaliatory power, etc., etc.” to “As a deterrent to war the United
                            States must etc., etc.”. The President agreed that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName>’s phraseology was an
                            improvement.</p>
                        <p>The Council then moved on to consider paragraph 16. After certain word
                            changes were agreed upon, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> said he felt it was his duty to mention that
                            the policy laid down in this paragraph was going to cost the United
                            States a very great deal of money. Indeed, some $450 million was
                            earmarked next year for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The
                            President remarked, with some chagrin, that when our divisions were
                            originally sent to Germany they were sent there on the assumption that
                            they would remain only until the French and the Germans could take up
                            the slack. Now we are not only going to provide new weapons and spare
                            parts to our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies, but we must
                            plan to keep our American divisions in Germany too.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName>’s comment on
                            costs impelled him to say that every time the military found a place
                            where they felt they needed to spend more money, they must also find
                            another place where they could make equivalent savings. There was not
                            much doubt that Congress would face us with a tax reduction in the near
                            future. We were desperately trying to find funds to launch a great roads
                            program. We were simply not going to be able to get any more money out
                            of Congress.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> said that these
                            observations reminded him that he ought to mention the recent visit of
                            the Italian Chief of Staff. General Mancinelli had informed him in
                            effect that unless the United States provided support for the Italian
                            armed forces at the rate of about $250 million a year, the Italian
                            Government would have to reduce the levels of its armed forces.<note n="9" xml:id="d61fn9">No record of <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>’s meeting with General Giuseppe Mancinelli,
                                Italian Chief of Staff, has been found in the Eisenhower Library or
                                Department of State files.</note> Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> had replied that the United
                            States would be glad to provide new weapons for the Italian Army if
                            Italy itself would supply the necessary spare parts. Mancinelli had
                            replied that Italy could not possibly do this. Accordingly, Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> charged that the
                            Italians not only expect us to give them new weapons; they also want our
                            financial help to support the existing force levels. It was tantamount
                            to blackmail. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>
                            expressed emphatic agreement with this judgment, and warned that we were
                            everywhere going to be faced with the proposition that either we help
                            support the armed forces of our allies or else they would quit being
                            allies.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_213" n="213" facs="0237"/>
                        <p>At this point the President intervened to ask the question whether the
                            United States must face national bankruptcy and the prospect of a
                            totalitarian control as the only means left to deal with an implacable
                            enemy. This was why, he said, he kept telling our Chiefs of Staff all
                            the time that they must behave as statesmen as well as military leaders.
                            They must somehow strike an appropriate balance between the military
                            needs of the nation and our resources under our free enterprise
                            economy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> went on to comment on paragraph 18,
                            which was new and dealt with the necessity for a dynamic research and
                            development program for military application. When he had completed his
                            explanation, the President commented that he presumed that the words
                            “increasing efforts” meant that the policy was recommending more money
                            for military research and development. This might be well and good, but
                            the President wanted to know whether the Defense Department had done all
                            it could for research and development within the limits of existing
                            funds. Perhaps it was doing this now. It was certainly not doing so a
                            few years back. In short, the question he wished to put was, can we not
                            increase the effectiveness as well as the scale of spending on our
                            research and development program?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> said that
                            $1.6 billion was a lot of money to be set aside for basic research
                            alone. When you added to this military pay and other things, the total
                            rose from $1.6 billion to $5.4 billion. The President went on to say
                            that he simply wondered how much money we were talking about in this
                            paragraph. He was quite sure that simply adding more money to this
                            program would not necessarily encourage the people involved in it to do
                            their best work. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> admitted that he had found some support for
                            the President’s argument in his recent tour of the various installations
                            where our guided missiles programs were being carried out. In most of
                            these places the provision of additional funds would not have
                            accelerated the completion of the missiles programs.</p>
                        <p>The President then said that in any event (looking at Director <persName corresp="#p_HRR1">Hughes</persName>) he would like to get the people
                            from the research and development program together some time and find
                            out where they are spending their money and at what point in carrying
                            out the R&amp;D program technical supervision and coordination had their
                            first impact. Director <persName corresp="#p_HRR1">Hughes</persName>
                            answered that the Bureau of the Budget had already tried to follow out
                            the President’s suggestion with Dr. Waterman’s group,<note n="10" xml:id="d61fn10">Dr. Alan T. Waterman, Director of the National
                                Science Foundation and Member of the Interdepartmental Committee on
                                Scientific Research and Development.</note> but the results so far
                            had not been very productive. Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName>
                            <pb xml:id="pg_214" n="214" facs="0238"/>suggested that the President
                            might wish to add this problem to the other areas in which the Planning
                            Board had recommended further detailed study.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the last sentence of paragraph 18, which called for the
                            speeding up of the means whereby important scientific discoveries could
                            be translated into a flow of new weapons, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> pointed out that a
                            full-fledged study was being carried forward by the Department of
                            Defense as this problem related to manned aircraft.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> next drew the Council’s attention to
                            paragragh 24, which called on the United States to encourage a high
                            level of international trade within the free world and to take the lead
                            in this process by reducing further “its own tariffs and other trade
                            restrictions over the next few years”. The Treasury and <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> members of the Planning Board had
                            recommended the addition of the phrase “with due regard to national
                            security and total national advantage”.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed surprise at this split of views, and said that if
                            we did not consider national security and total national advantage
                            already, we should certainly now move to do so. He looked on the whole
                            problem of reducing trade restrictions and tariffs in terms of our
                            national security and total national advantage. Accordingly, it was
                            agreed to accept the additional phraseology proposed by the <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> and Treasury members of the Planning
                            Board.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> then went on to paragraph 25. Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> raised a question
                            with respect to paragraph 25–b, which indicated that the United States
                            might find it expedient to continue economic assistance to certain
                            European countries (e.g., Spain, Yugoslavia, Turkey), etc., etc. Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> wanted to know
                            whether the specification of these three countries meant that we would
                            not furnish such economic assistance to any other European countries.
                            Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> explained that this paragraph had been
                            inserted because of the virtual cessation of U.S. economic aid to
                            European countries, and the Planning Board’s view that in certain
                            exceptional circumstances it might be desirable to continue such
                            economic aid.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed some doubt as to the wisdom of specifying only
                            these three countries. If it was expedient to assist these countries, it
                            might be expedient to assist others. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> commented that we were already
                            committed to economic assistance in the case of Spain and Turkey, and
                            that we were in addition giving a lot of Public Law 480<note n="11" xml:id="d61fn11">Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act
                                of 1954. (68 Stat. 454)</note> assistance to Yugoslavia. The
                            President then directed the deletion of subparagraph 25–b.</p>
                        <p>The Council moved on to consider paragraph 27, which dealt with United
                            States programs to promote sound development in the less developed
                            nations. Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> pointed out that there was a
                                <pb xml:id="pg_215" n="215" facs="0239"/>split in paragraph 27,
                            occasioned by the proposal of the Treasury, <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> and Budget members of the Planning Board to insert the
                            phrase that despite such assistance as we might be required to provide
                            less developed nations, “over the long run the total lever of U.S.
                            economic assistance world-wide should be reduced as rapidly as is
                            consistent with U.S. security interests.” Mr.
                                <persName>Anderson</persName> suggested that Director <persName corresp="#p_HRR1">Hughes</persName> might wish to speak to this
                            point.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRR1">Hughes</persName> pointed out that the
                            proposed language had existed in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            5501. If now this language were to be omitted, it would look as though
                            we had changed our policy on reducing the total level of U.S. economic
                            assistance, and he believed it was still our policy objective to do so.
                            Accordingly, he favored inserting the bracketed phrase.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that in
                            point of fact we were asking Congress for an extra $100 million this
                            year for assistance to less developed nations. If we were going to be
                            logical, therefore, we should introduce the word “increased” along with
                            the word “reduced” in the sentence in question.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that it
                            was his emphatic view that over the long run the United States should
                            get out of the field of providing economic assistance to foreign
                            nations. This was not the kind of a burden that the people of the United
                            States would be willing to bear indefinitely, and it should be our
                            objective to get out as rapidly as we could. If Congress once got the
                            idea that the burden of foreign aid was regarded by the Executive Branch
                            as permanent, we would certainly be in hot water.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he believed
                            the use of the term “permanent” was very dangerous. Our real objective
                            is to provide for the security of the United States, and to that end it
                            was an illusion to imagine that we can reduce the level of our foreign
                            assistance expenditures in the near future. The President agreed that,
                            particularly in view of the new Soviet tactics, the inclusion of this
                            phraseology might lend itself to illusions. However, he said, he would
                            not object to including this proposed language if to it were added the
                            thought that it would not be possible to reduce the total level of U.S.
                            economic assistance for a long time to come. After further discussion,
                            the President suggested new language to meet the point. We should say in
                            effect that the level of U.S. economic assistance should attain but not
                            exceed a total level consistent with U.S. security interests. If
                            language to this effect were included, the language proposed by the
                            Treasury, <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> and Budget should be
                            deleted.</p>
                        <p>Proceeding to a consideration of paragraph 27–b, on U.S. foreign economic
                            programs, Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> pointed out that this
                            subparagraph was new. After Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> had read
                            the language, the President commented that here again, as in the
                            military field, the Soviets have <pb xml:id="pg_216" n="216" facs="0240"/>every opportunity to play us for suckers. We must be careful not to be
                            drawn into matching every Soviet offer of assistance to foreign
                            nations.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> commented that
                            paragraph 27 raised terrific questions. Our economic assistance to
                            underdeveloped nations was rendered on a government-to-government basis.
                            As a result, our policy was actually achieving nothing but the building
                            up of little imitations of the Soviet Union throughout the
                            underdeveloped areas of the world. If we continued this policy it would
                            mark the end of all hope for setting up free individual enterprise in
                            any of these countries. This result would be a far cry from our own idea
                            of the kind of world we wanted to see.</p>
                        <p>The President, in response to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, stated that he could see no good reason why
                            the present paragraph should not contain language designed to encourage
                            the investment of private capital in the programs for building up the
                            underdeveloped countries. To develop private enterprise in these areas
                            had always been a part of our foreign policy. Mr.
                                <persName>Anderson</persName> agreed to insert language to meet the
                            President’s point.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> pointed out
                            that many of our allies have begun to think that nations who professed a
                            policy of neutrality were more successful than actual allies of the
                            United States in securing U.S. economic assistance. He believed that
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> might wish to
                            speak further on this subject. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> elaborated on this point and cited various
                            examples, notably Pakistan. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> added the comment that in Latin America it was
                            often argued that the only way to extract money from the United States
                            was to plead the danger of Communism. The President commented that the
                            sad fact was that we did not have enough allies really determined to
                            maintain their freedom to a point where they were willing to see the
                            United States spend its money in the really critical areas.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> pointed out his
                            view that regional arrangements for economic assistance were the best
                            way to counter the new Soviet tactics. He felt that it was a mistake
                            that the present paper contained nothing by way of support for the idea
                            of extending U.S. aid on a regional rather than an individual country
                            basis.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> then pointed out that the problem of
                            aid to underdeveloped countries was yet another area for which the
                            Planning Board was recommending special study in its covering
                            memorandum. The President inquired if this was not a subject on which
                            Joe Dodge was also working. When it had been pointed out that this was
                            indeed the case, the President suggested that the Council not act on the
                            subject until these additional studies had been completed.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_217" n="217" facs="0241"/>
                        <p>Moving on to paragraph 30, which dealt with the problem of nationalist
                            and reform movements in colonial areas in Asia and Africa, Mr.
                                <persName>Anderson</persName> invited attention to the <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> proposal that the “extension of the
                            trusteeship principle in appropriate circumstances with strategic
                            safeguards may offer a defensible and acceptable alternative to strictly
                            colonial control.” The President asked Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> what precisely the <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> Planning Board member had in mind in proposing this
                            language. In turn, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName>
                            asked Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> what Dr. Elliott had had in
                            mind. Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> explained. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then commented that the area of
                            possible use of the trusteeship principle was too meager to deserve
                            being singled out in this fashion. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> agreed to drop the proposal.</p>
                        <p>At this point Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> indicated that it was
                            quarter to twelve, and that the Council might wish now to adjourn and
                            complete its consideration of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602
                            at its next meeting on Thursday, March 1. The Council agreed with this
                            suggestion, but Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            stated that he might not be able to be present at the meeting next
                            Thursday, and wished to say a few words about the problem of flexibility
                            which he had mentioned earlier in the morning’s discussion. The
                            President indicated that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> should proceed.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that, at
                            least in those sections of the paper which had been covered this
                            morning, there had not been adequate recognition of the need for greater
                            administrative flexibility on the part of the United States in
                            countering the current Soviet economic offensive. When we devised
                            programs of economic assistance under the existing arrangements, we had
                            to explain every single last item to the Congress on every expenditure
                            which we proposed to make. This would be absurd in the case of military
                            planning, which was permitted great flexibility, and we needed similar
                            flexibility in the cold war.</p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_HRR1">Hughes</persName> indicated that the
                            Bureau of the Budget was giving this matter of administrative
                            flexibility the most intensive study. Both the Bureau of the Budget and
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> were strongly in favor
                            of trying to secure the required flexibility.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he was
                            glad to hear this, but still believed that the problem required special
                            mention in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602. With this view the
                            President expressed agreement. Thereupon Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he would like just to
                            outline a kind of example of what he had in mind. Suppose, for instance,
                            the United States went to the Czechoslovakian Government and said in
                            effect that Czechoslovakia needed a lot of cotton. We would be glad to
                            give this cotton to Czechoslovakia, together with butter, meats, fats,
                            and other foods of which we had large surpluses. We would then propose
                            some kind of a deal by which in return for these commodities
                            Czechoslovakia was to provide us with war goods or other things. Any
                            such proposal as this to Czechoslovakia would simply “raise hell” in the
                            Soviet satellite countries. <pb xml:id="pg_218" n="218" facs="0242"/>The
                            Soviets, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>,
                            are grievously exploiting the satellites. Why can’t we exploit this
                            fact, just as the Soviets are exploiting our allies and the neutral
                            nations? Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed
                            out that this, of course, was just an off-the-cuff suggestion and that
                            it had not been staffed. But if the United States were to decide to make
                            such moves as this, they would have to be made quickly if they were to
                            be effective. Under the existing lack of flexibility we simply could not
                            move quickly enough.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired whether he could not put some such suggestion as
                            that made by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> in
                            the next message he was to send down to the Congress. Director <persName corresp="#p_HRR1">Hughes</persName> added that it would be next to
                            impossible to get the Congress to agree to any such proposal as that
                            outlined by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The President said that of course the trouble was that the Congress
                            believed that any and all U.S. trade with the Soviet bloc was wrong and
                            bad. On the contrary, the President said, what he wanted to set in
                            motion was centrifugal forces rather than centripetal forces in the
                            Soviet bloc. U.S. trade with the bloc might eventually prove to be such
                            a centrifugal force.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> closed the
                            discussion by stating that his plan was only an illustration of the kind
                            of flexibility that the President might need in the future in dealing
                            with the new Soviet tactics.</p>
                        <p>Thereafter the Council adjourned, with the understanding that it would
                            consider the remainder of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602 at

                            5602 where it had stopped at last Monday’s meeting. He proceeded to read
                            paragraphs 33–a and –b, indicating that this paragraph and its successor
                            referred to the subject of East-West relations. He also noted that the

                            paragraph 35 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602, likewise on
                            East-West contacts, constituted a new paragraph not covered by <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5501. He said that the Planning Board
                            believed the problem set forth in paragraph 35 was becoming of
                            increasing importance, and he accordingly read the paragraph in toto. He
                            noted that in general adoption of paragraph 35 would tend to liberalize
                            somewhat existing policy with respect to the exchange of persons and
                            delegations between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the
                            United States. Finally, he pointed out that this problem had been the
                            subject of a special report by the Intelligence Advisory Committee
                                (<gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss>–D–103, entitled “Intelligence

                            highlights and conclusions of the above-mentioned estimate, stressing
                            that previous exchanges of delegations, notably the exchange of
                            delegations of farmers, had been on the whole more advantageous to the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> than it had to the United

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he did
                            not know whether the point was covered elsewhere in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602, but this particular estimate of
                            the net advantage or disadvantage to be achieved by the exchange of
                            delegations was based on considerations of net gain or loss applying
                            only to the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Visits
                            to the United States of Soviet nationals and delegations would be
                            relatively without danger to the United States, because this country was
                            prepared to handle the risks inherent in such visits. Other countries
                            were less capable of meeting the danger, <pb xml:id="pg_220" n="220" facs="0244"/>and we could not afford to ignore the effect of our own
                            example on third countries whose thinking on the subject of the
                            Communist danger was not so clear, strong and united as our own.
                            Countries such as Liberia, for example, might not be able to absorb
                            Soviet visitors without dangerous repercussions. Such countries would be
                            put in an awkward position if the Russians turned to them and said the
                            United States permits us to send delegations to visit it; why do you not
                            do likewise? Quoting from the Bible text, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> warned that we should not follow
                            courses which might cause our neighbors “to stumble”.</p>
                        <p>Although the President said he thought that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ point seemed to be covered in
                            paragraph 36, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            went on to say that we were currently trying to induce Liberia and
                            Uruguay not to accept Soviet visitations, on the assumption that while
                            we could successfully handle such visits, they could not.</p>
                        <p>The President said that this seemed rather too bad, inasmuch as one of
                            our objectives at Geneva last summer had been to invite and encourage
                            closer contacts between East and West. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that the emphasis at
                            Geneva had been rather on the exchange of information and ideas than on
                            the exchange of persons, and he said he still favored the former type of
                            exchange.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> suggested that
                            another aspect of this issue needed to be emphasized. We can also be
                            adroit in making use of the results obtained by visits to the Soviet
                            Union made by other free world citizens. This whole thing, he believed,
                            represented a new situation; that is, both a new threat to the free
                            world and a new opportunity for it. Perhaps the United States could
                            contribute some help to the weaker countries which received Soviet
                            delegations, by assisting these countries [<hi rend="italic">10 words

                        <p>The President said that he would like to [<hi rend="italic">12 words not
                                declassified</hi>] see if it were possible to turn the exchange of
                            delegations into a procedure which would be more definitely to the
                            advantage of the United States. [<hi rend="italic">1 sentence (4½ lines
                                of source text) not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> commented
                            vigorously that the exchange of persons and delegations between the U.S.
                            and the Soviet bloc countries was a major problem and potentiality for
                            the United States, and that it required to be studied with the very
                            closest care. If properly handled, such exchange of persons could
                            conceivably mean an opportunity to change the whole situation in the
                            Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>The President then turned to Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> and told him
                            to look into the situation along with the <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss>. He further indicated that language should be inserted
                            in paragraph 35 by way of warning of the dangers of the example set by
                            the United States, in accepting Soviet delegations, on countries more
                            vulnerable than the United States to Communist exploitation through the
                            agency of such delegations.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_221" n="221" facs="0245"/>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> expressed the
                            opinion that the considerations which applied to exchange of persons
                            also applied to trade and to negotiations between the U.S. and the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. He added that it was very
                            difficult for many other countries to control their Soviet visitors.
                            Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>, on the other
                            hand, repeated his earlier view that the exchange of persons presented
                            the United States with both a great threat and a great opportunity. He
                            said he believed that this paragraph was one of the most important in
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (5 lines of source text) not
                                declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>The President then inquired of the Council which agencies of the
                            Government should make a study of this problem. He first suggested that
                            this be done by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>
                            and by Mr. J. Edgar Hoover. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>, however,
                            indicated the desirability of adding other officials, and suggested that
                            the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> undertake the study with the
                            assistance of Mr. J. Edgar Hoover and the Department of Justice. The
                            President indicated that what he wished this study of paragraph 35 to
                            contain was primarily an analysis. What would the United States gain by
                            such exchange of persons, and what would it lose? What were the risks,
                            and what were the advantages?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> touched on the
                            likelihood of a considerable influx of U.S. tourists to the Soviet Union
                            in the coming months. He indicated that if we did not reciprocate by
                            admitting Soviet tourists, we might lend color to the familiar charge of
                            the Soviet Union that it was the U.S. rather than the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> which maintained an Iron Curtain.</p>
                        <p>At this point Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> referred to the fact that
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JWH1">William Jackson</persName>, who had
                            taken over from <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Nelson

                            this subject.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JWH1">Jackson</persName> stated that the
                            considerations which the National Security Council had been discussing
                            in connection with paragraph 35 were available in more detailed form and
                            could readily be brought to the Council’s attention. What was required,
                            however, more than detailed considerations, was the exercise of an act
                            of judgment by the National Security Council; that was the heart of the
                            matter. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JWH1">Jackson</persName> added that
                            what had scared him at Geneva was the fact that the Soviets wanted
                            exchange of persons and the development of East-West contacts, and that
                            was all they wanted. From a procedural point of view, the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> needs to have the considerations pro
                            and con spelled out in greater detail so that the President could reach
                            a judgment between them.</p>
                        <p>At this point the Secretary of State made reference to the fact that
                            certain areas of the United States were now closed to Soviet visitors
                            (in <pb xml:id="pg_222" n="222" facs="0246"/>accordance with paragraph 3

                                (Department of State, <gloss target="#t_SS1">S/S</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Files: Lot 63 D 351, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5508 Memoranda)</note>). This had
                            caused embarrassment in the case of a distinguished Soviet violinist,
                            who had been unable to perform at a concert in Rochester, New York.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> believed that it
                            might be desirable to review the policy set forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5508/1. The Attorney General commented
                            that the accompanist of the Soviet violinist was a well-known espionage
                            agent. The President wondered whether we could not make exceptions to
                            our geographical restrictions in the case of artists such as this. The
                            Attorney General indicated that it was within his competence to make
                            exceptions. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName>
                            pointed out the difficulties which confronted <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> in determining the advisability of admitting Soviet
                            delegations, and supported Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ suggestion that the time had come for a review
                            of the policy in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5508/1. If a
                            revision were made, the policy should be set forth in greater
                            detail.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> then invited the Council’s attention to
                            paragraphs 36 and 37, dealing with the problems of negotiation with the
                            Soviet Union and disarmament, respectively. He noted that the Joint
                            Chiefs of Staff had proposed a substitute for the existing paragraph 36,
                            emphasizing the dangers of making concessions to the Soviet Union on any
                            implication of its good will or its good faith. He read the substitute
                            paragraph proposed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and then asked Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> to enlarge on the
                            reasoning of the Joint Chiefs.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> said that the
                            reasons behind the proposed <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                            substitution were clearly set forth in their memorandum. The same
                            considerations, moreover, applied to negotiations with the Soviet Union
                            as applied to the exchange of visiting delegations, which the Council
                            had just discussed. Every negotiation between the United States and a
                            Communist country, whatever other advantage it might have for the
                            Communists, provided them with a little more “respectability”. There
                            were also great propaganda advantages for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. This had been true of the Geneva negotiations,
                            particularly in their repercussions in the Far East. In sum, the Joint
                            Chiefs of Staff simply felt that a readiness to negotiate was one thing;
                            but we must not forget the repercussions of our negotiations with the
                            Soviets on other countries.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired as to the precise difference between the language
                            suggested by the Planning Board and that suggested by the Joint Chiefs
                            of Staff with respect to the problem of negotiations. Mr.
                                <persName>Anderson</persName> read the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> language, and pointed out that in general the Joint
                            Chiefs stressed the need for caution and the danger that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would be the gainer by U.S.
                            concessions.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_223" n="223" facs="0247"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he
                            could perceive no objection to the phraseology of the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff if they would take the word “clearly” out of their first sentence.
                            It was never possible to state “clearly” when negotiations would appear
                            to serve the security interests of the United States. Often you had to
                            enter into negotiations before you could perceive either a clear
                            advantage or a clear disadvantage.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> countered by
                            suggesting that there was something of value both in the language
                            suggested by the Planning Board and in that suggested by the Joint
                            Chiefs of Staff. Accordingly, he recommended retaining the language
                            suggested by the Planning Board and adding to it that proposed by the
                            Joint Chiefs.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> contended that
                            the language of the Planning Board tended to emphasize only the “good
                            side” of negotiations with the Soviet Union. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> language, on the other hand, added a warning as to the
                            “bad side”. The Joint Chiefs of Staff felt that we should be much less
                            anxious to negotiate with the Soviet Union, and should carefully weigh
                            the pros and cons before we did so. Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> agreed, but pointed out that if the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> language were added, both sides of the
                            question would receive due emphasis. The President agreed with this
                            proposal.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> then turned to paragraph 37, on
                            disarmament. The Secretary of State left the meeting to keep an
                            appointment at the State Department, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> replaced him at the Council
                            table. With respect to paragraph 37, Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName>
                            pointed out the suggestion of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for an
                            additional sentence which would stress the importance of safeguards
                            against violations and evasions of a disarmament agreement, and
                            especially the importance of the inspection system.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> agreed with the
                            desirability of adding the language proposed by the Joint Chiefs, but
                            thought that the sentence would come better at the end of the existing
                            paragraph. He said that his own position did not differ from that taken
                            by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> said that he
                            was uncertain of the meaning of the language in paragraph 37 which said
                            that, along with the search for a safeguarded disarmament system, the
                            U.S. should seek concurrently in related parallel steps to resolve other
                            major international issues. Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> explained
                            the import of this language. The President enlarged on this explanation,
                            and cited the unification of Germany as an example of a major
                            international issue. He said, with a sigh, that this was probably not
                            much more than a collection of “pious platitudes”.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_224" n="224" facs="0248"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> indicated that there were no major
                            issues until paragraph 45, on the mobilization base, where there was now
                            a three-way split. On the left-hand side of page 25 was the language on
                            the mobilization base proposed by the majority of the Planning Board; on
                            the right-hand side was language proposed by the Treasury and Budget
                            members of the Planning Board. In addition, the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
                            while accepting in the main the language of the majority proposal, had
                            nevertheless suggested a revision and shortening of this language which
                            would eliminate all the details in paragraph 45–b and substitute
                            therefor the statement that “the mobilization base should be predicated
                            upon war plans”.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> indicated that as far
                            as he was concerned, he liked the proposal of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                            and believed that their revision of the introductory phrase in paragraph
                            45–a constituted a clarification. He also agreed to the elimination of
                            the details in paragraph 45–b. On the other hand, as for the rest of the
                            language in 45–a, he much preferred the language of the majority of the
                            Planning Board to the shorter version proposed by the Treasury and
                            Budget.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> said that probably Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> or Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName>, the Acting Director of the
                            Budget, would wish to comment at this point.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that he
                            simply believed that the degree of detail in which the statement of the
                            majority had been set forth was too great, until such time, at least, as
                            we have agreed on how we propose to fight a future war, and until we
                            have a basic defense plan for the United States. If we did otherwise, we
                            would be laying the policy groundwork for a lot of things in our
                            mobilization base that may never be required. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said with great emphasis that
                            we must always strive to balance what we wanted in our national defense
                            against what we could afford to spend. This was the practical approach.
                            Accordingly, all the generalities which occurred in the language of the
                            majority, respecting all the things we’d like to have in our
                            mobilization base, could be very dangerous indeed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> said he felt the same
                            way. He could find nothing to quarrel with in the statement on the
                            mobilization base which had been in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            5501 and which was in the main now being proposed by the Treasury and
                            Budget members of the Planning Board. He did not believe that the
                            implications of the more detailed language of the majority proposal had
                            been sufficiently explored</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> said that he was
                            inclined also to agree with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>’s position, although when this subject had come
                            up for discussion among the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he had indicated that
                            he did not care one way or another as between the two versions. The real
                            problem regarding the mobilization base at the present time was whether
                            or not our mobilization base was intended to make allowance <pb xml:id="pg_225" n="225" facs="0249"/>for enemy bomb damage and for
                            the provision of support by the United States to its allies in a major
                            war. In the event that it were not actually destroyed in the initial
                            phases of a war, said Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>, the United States now has a mobilization base
                            better than it had ever before had in its history. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> expressed skepticism as to the
                            possibility of doing much by way of dispersion to diminish the
                            vulnerability of the mobilization base. Moreover, though there was some
                            real advantage in safe storage, this was difficult and expensive to
                            achieve. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>
                            expressed hearty agreement with the sentiments of Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> observed that the
                            recent comments of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>, had been directed more to paragraph 45–b than
                            to 45–a. In so far as these comments applied to paragraph 45–b, he was
                            inclined to agree. As to paragraph 45–a, however, it was in fact the
                            mobilization base policy currently being followed by the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff and the <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss>. While he was
                            perfectly willing to agree to the elimination of paragraph 45–b in favor
                            of the brief <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> substitute, he did feel
                            it essential to point out that the issues identified in paragraph 45–b
                            were all issues which the Administration must ultimately face and
                            resolve.</p>
                        <p>Turning to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, the
                            President said that he failed to see any particular language in
                            paragraph 45 which seemed to call for additional expenditures. So far as
                            he could see, the staff people who had formulated this language were
                            simply trying to spell out in more precise language the existing
                            directives regarding the mobilization base. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> replied that if the language
                            did not mean that any new things were to be done in this area, why was
                            it necessary to have new language at all? This would only get us into
                            trouble. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> assured the
                            President that the language recommended by Defense and <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> in paragraphs 45–a–(1), –(2) and –(3)
                            would not be the basis for the development of any new mobilization base
                            programs. Futhermore, he insisted that from a fiscal point of view there
                            were no essential differences between the language on the right and left
                            sides of the page, although the longer version on the left represented a
                            more accurate description of the requirements of our mobilization
                            base.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> said he emphatically
                            believed that more work should be done in defining the term
                            “mobilization base”. Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> referred to the
                            language on the mobilization base which occurred in the previous basic
                            national security policy, NCS 5501. It had the advantage of brevity, and
                            did not differ in substance from what was recommended in the right-hand
                            column. He also reminded the Council that Defense and <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> were developing a new study of the
                            requirements of the mobilization base.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_226" n="226" facs="0250"/>
                        <p>The President warned that the Defense Department must not “clam up” and
                            refuse to give enough of the outlines of its war plans so that <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> could not go ahead and do the job which
                            was required of them. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> assured the President that to date, at any
                            rate, the military had not clammed up on <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss>. He again pointed out his agreement with the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> proposal to drop most of paragraph
                            45–b. On the other hand, sooner or later, in dealing with the
                            mobilization base, we should have to face up to the problem of whether
                            this base must include support of our allies and the element allowed for
                            bomb damage.</p>
                        <p>The President observed that one of the main troubles confronting the
                            Council in considering the mobilization base was, as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> had just suggested, the fact
                            that no one had yet given us a clear definition of what was meant by the
                            term “mobilization base”. Once we had defined this term, we wouldn’t
                            scare so many people into thinking that our mobilization base called for
                            enormous reserves of war material. In any event, the President said, he
                            was personally quite satisfied with the brief language on the right-hand
                            page proposed by the Treasury and the Budget. On the other hand, if Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> preferred the more
                            detailed language on the left, the President saw no objection to its
                            adoption.</p>
                        <p>At this point Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> suggested that the
                            language on the left-hand side of the page had the support of the
                            Defense Department and was not, as he had earlier suggested, proposed
                            solely by the <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that this
                            discussion was not very useful. He was not interested in words, but only
                            in concrete issues. In short, he did not wish to adopt language which
                            would ultimately mean the addition of $5 billion to the Defense
                            Department budget.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> said that the
                            Defense Department was hard at work on its study of the mobilization
                            base. Before completing its task, however, it required clearer
                            guidelines from the National Security Council. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> said that at the present time
                            the military were operating on the basis of having war reserves
                            sufficient to last for six months in a future war. This was the basis
                            given to the military in a directive from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>. On the other hand, provision
                            for aid to our allies had not been cranked into this mobilization base
                            concept. Moreover, the concept assumed that the United States would make
                            at least as good a recovery from the initial attacks as would the Soviet
                            Union. If we went beyond this six-months reserve concept, Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> freely admitted that
                            the mobilization base would cost a lot more money.</p>
                        <p>Addressing himself to Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>, the President inquired as to whether any of our
                            allies overseas had been building facilities to provide spare parts and
                            ammunition for the weapons we gave them. It <pb xml:id="pg_227" n="227" facs="0251"/>had always been the President’s idea that we should
                            simply provide these allies with weapons in amounts for which they were
                            in a position to provide replacements and ammunition.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that if
                            the Council was convinced that the policies concerning the mobilization
                            base under which we are now operating are the right policies, why could
                            not this fact be stated in very simple terms? Introducing a lot of
                            generalities in the statement on mobilization base would inevitably cost
                            money. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName>
                            assured Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> that
                            paragraph 45–a conformed almost exactly to the actualities of what we
                            were now doing to build up our mobilization base. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that if he was assured
                            that it would not cost any more money, he was willing to accept the
                            language proposed by the majority of the Planning Board. The President
                            concurred in this propsal, and went on to state that he wished the
                            Department of Defense and the <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> to get
                            together and provide an agreed definition of the term “mobilization
                            base”.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> said the next important paragraph was
                            48, dealing with the manpower program. Subparagraph 48–a contained a
                            split as follows: “Expand and improve scientific and technical training
                            [at all appropriate levels as a matter of national urgency requiring
                            Federal leadership].”<note n="8" xml:id="d62fn8">Brackets in the source
                                text.</note> The Treasury and Budget members of the Planning Board
                            proposed deletion of the bracketed phraseology.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he was getting “a little tired” of statements
                            like this in paragraph 48–a, which called for more Federal leadership.
                            All we seemed to be doing these days was to shout more and more about
                            the need for additional technical and scientific personnel. He
                            personally would very much like to see a thoroughgoing study of this
                            problem from the Department of Health, Education and Welfare,
                            particularly an analysis of the number of students entering scientific
                            fields. He warned that a country like this needed a great deal more than
                            simply scientists if it was to be properly run. We could not afford to
                            neglect our social sciences and other professions. The President stated
                            with emphasis that there is an inherent balance in civilization, and we
                            should attempt to define it. Why, therefore, call for Federal money and
                            leadership to be devoted to the sciences only? If we did this we would
                            find all young people going into the sciences, while as a matter of fact
                            we needed equally trained lawyers and good statesmen in the country.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> pointed out that the President had
                            captured the essence of the split in views respecting paragraph 48–a. He
                            went on to say that a considerable study of our scientific and
                            technological manpower problems had already been made. In this study,
                            representatives of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare had
                            participated. <pb xml:id="pg_228" n="228" facs="0252"/>Moreover, the
                            Planning Board had recommended that this study be made the subject of a
                            presentation to the National Security Council. In reply, the President
                            stressed that he wanted the heads of HEW to approve the analysis and
                            findings of any study of our technological and scientific manpower
                            problem. He was not willing simply to take the word of staff
                            representatives from that Department. He added that he believed the
                            Council should take a hard, cold look at our needs in this field. If
                            necessity dictated it, he said, he would be willing to provide funds for
                            Federal scholarships to able scientific students. On the other hand, he
                            did not wish to pour Federal money into the colleges and universities as
                            a means of encouraging scientific training. All too often such funds
                            ended up being diverted to overhead. Above all, the President called for
                            a businesslike approach to the problem.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> said he judged from the President’s
                            remarks that he favored deletion of the bracketed language. The
                            President said that he did wish to see it removed, because as it was
                            written no one could see the limit of money involved in carrying out the
                            proposed policy.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> said that he was glad
                            to hear the President’s views on this matter. He had just sent the
                            President a written statement on scientific problems which he would now
                            recall. He did add, however, that at the secondary school level the
                            teaching of the social sciences was much more effective than the
                            teaching of mathematics and the natural sciences. The President quipped,
                            why then do we get so many left-wingers from our high schools? The
                            President went on to state that his show of emphasis in his remarks on
                            this subject should not be misunderstood. Of course he wanted to
                            encourage the study of the sciences by our young people.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> observed that
                            these things come and go in waves. We were in real difficulty a few
                            years ago because there were more engineers being trained than there
                            were jobs for them to fill. He himself had started life as an engineer,
                            but had changed because he could not earn enough money to get married
                            (laughter).</p>
                        <p>The President repeated his earlier view that money might be found to give
                            scholarship assistance to promising Ph.D. students in the sciences.
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName>, however, pointed
                            out that the real bottleneck was at the secondary school rather than at
                            the university level. There were too few teacher of the sciences in our
                            secondary schools, and those we had were not particularly competent.
                            This was a very serious matter indeed, and could not be remedied as a
                            matter of urgency. It would take years to correct the imbalance, but
                            every effort should be made to do so. Progress over the short term might
                            be made if large companies would lend their employees for a certain
                            number of days each month to teach the sciences in our secondary schools
                            of the <pb xml:id="pg_229" n="229" facs="0253"/>communities in which
                            these companies were situated. Over the long term the most feasible
                            solution would be to have the colleges and universities stipulate the
                            sciences as requirements for entry.</p>
                        <p>The President appeared surprised to learn that the problem was largely at
                            the secondary school level, and inquired how many scientists our
                            colleges and universities were now turning out and how many we needed.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> said that we
                            were producing about 25,000 engineers a year from our colleges. We
                            wanted to increase that number to at least 50,000.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName> pointed out that
                            last year 32% of the college students who had entered upon a scientific
                            course in college either switched to some other major field or flunked
                            out of college as a result of inadequate scientific preparation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> said that the Council had now completed
                            its consideration of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602, and
                            recapitulated the decisions of the Council. In particular he suggested
                            that paragraph 11 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602 be
                            tentatively adopted subject to revision following consideration of the
                            study of nuclear weapons expected from the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The
                            President said he understood that the Department of Defense wanted to
                            suspend action on paragraph 11. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>, however, stated that he believed paragraph 11
                            as it stood would be satisfactory without the additional language
                            proposed by the Department of State. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> pointed out that the new
                            paper from the Joint Chiefs, on the subject of the use of atomic
                            weapons, would be ready for the President’s consideration early next
                            week. The President indicated that action on paragraph 11 would be
                                suspended.<note n="9" xml:id="d62fn9">In a memorandum dated March 15

                                Use of Atomic Weapons,” dated February 15, approved paragraph 11 of
                                    <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602/1, with the addition of
                                a final sentence. The paragraph, as approved, reads as follows: “It
                                is the policy of the United States to integrate nuclear weapons with
                                other weapons in the arsenal of the United States. Nuclear weapons
                                will be used in general war and in military operations short of
                                general war as authorized by the President. Such authorization as
                                may be given in advance will be determined by the President.”

                        <p>At the very end of the meeting, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName> pointed out, with respect to paragraph 12, that
                            the United States possessed no radiological weapons and, moreover, he
                            knew of no requirement for such weapons. In the light of this
                            information, inclusion of the reference to radiological weapons in
                            paragraph 12 might lead to a misunderstanding. Accordingly, the
                            President directed the deletion of the reference to radiological weapons
                            in paragraph 12.</p>

                        <p>(16) Deletion (on page 19, paragraph 36, 2nd line) of the word “clearly”;

                            concessions. Until the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> evidences a
                            modification of its basic hostility toward the non-Communist world
                            through concrete actions, agreements should be dependent upon a balance
                            of advantages to the non-Communist world and not upon implied good will
                            or trust in written documents.”</p>
                        <p>(17) Addition (on page 20, paragraph 37) of the following final sentence:

                            on the scope and effectiveness of the safeguards against violations and
                            evasions, and especially the inspection system.”</p>
                        <p>(18) Adoption (on page 25, paragraph 45) of the Majority Proposal in the
                            left-hand column, changed as follows:</p>

                            military readiness to enter combat, ranging from local to general war,
                            and to provide the capability of meeting expeditiously the needs of our

                        <p>(b) Substitution for subparagraph b of the following:</p>
                        <p>“b. The mobilization base should be predicated upon approved war
                            plans.”</p>
                        <p>(19) Deletion (on page 29, paragraph 48–a) of the bracketed phrase and
                            the footnote relating thereto.</p>

                        <p>At its 279th meeting on March 8, the National Security Council discussed
                            the matter of a reappraisal of United States policy regarding Soviet
                            bloc shipments afforded diplomatic immunity. This discussion centered in
                            part on <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5527, dated December 1,
                            1955, prepared by the <gloss target="#t_ICIS1">ICIS</gloss> and the
                                <gloss target="#t_IIC1">IIC</gloss>, with the ad hoc participation
                            of representatives of the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and the

                        <p>The Council adopted Recommendation 1 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5527, which noted that “No size or weight restrictions
                            should be imposed at this time on diplomatic pouches and shipments under
                            diplomatic seal from Soviet bloc countries.” It also noted the stand-by
                            plans contained in Recommendations 2 and 3 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5527 for action in the event of a decision by the
                            President to impose restrictions as recommended, and directed the <gloss target="#t_IIC1">IIC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ICIS1">ICIS</gloss> to keep such plans under continuing review, with
                            reports to the Council at appropriate intervals. The Council directed
                            the United States Communications Board to study and report to the
                            Council on the “feasibility of maintaining an adequate and secure U.S.

                            with an amendment noted in the record; and directed the Department of
                            State to “study the feasibility of obtaining international agreement

                        <p>1. In the reference you ask the Joint Chiefs of Staff for an</p>
                        <p>a. Outline military strategy for the United States which best meets the
                            demands of our National Security, and</p>
                        <p>b. Guidance which can serve as the basis for the determination of the
                            size, nature, composition, and deployment of the U.S. Armed Forces for

                        <pb xml:id="pg_235" n="235" facs="0259"/>
                        <p>You give us certain basic factors which you estimate will remain valid
                            during the period in question and which we should take into account in
                            making our forward plans.</p>
                        <p>2. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have reviewed our current military strategy
                            and posture and conclude that our basic military programs remain
                            generally valid and that these programs will, so far as can be forecast
                            at this time, continue to be valid through the period 1958–1960. In
                            other words, is is our opinion that our current military programs
                            continue to represent the minimum U.S. military forces required for
                            national security.</p>
                        <p>3. a. With the conclusion reached in paragraph 2, the question of cost
                            arises in connection with the maintenance of these forces. The Joint
                            Chiefs of Staff point out that the maintenance of current leveled-off
                            military programs will, in their opinion, become increasingly costly in
                            the period just ahead. This is due to several factors, but principally
                            to, (1) the stepped up missile program, (2) the increased cost of new
                            equipment and weapons systems and the probable requirement to procure
                            both more rapidly.</p>
                        <p>We estimate that, with careful management and continual review, annual
                            military expenditure during the period 1958–1959–1960 may be held within
                            approximately 38–40 billions, if our present force levels and
                            deployments are maintained. In light of the projected increases in
                            national population and productivity, this increase is believed
                            compatible with the requirements of a sound economy.</p>
                        <p>b. If present grant military aid programs are maintained, at least an
                            additional 3 billion annually will be required. New requirements in this
                            area—such as an adequate air defense system for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and a program of new weapons, world-wide—cannot be
                            met, in all likelihood, by compensation reductions. We estimate,
                            therefore, that our military aid program, if not basically changed,
                            will, as a minimum, amount to between 4 and 5 billion annually during
                            the period 1958–1960. It may well be greater.</p>
                        <p>c. We realize that annual direct defense expenditures of the above
                            magnitude (42–45 billion) may have serious effects on the economy of the
                            United States, but we are unable to forecast a military situation
                            vis-à-vis the Soviet bloc in this time period which will realistically
                            permit much reduction, unless our present overseas deployments and our
                            grant military aid programs are reduced.</p>
                        <p>d. From a strictly U.S. military point of view, reduction of our overseas
                            commitments continues to be a desirable objective. It is obvious to us,
                            however, that in the Far East little reduction can be made without
                            running risks of a renewal of hostilities, while in Europe, the
                            psychological effects of any sizeable withdrawal of U.S. forces might
                            well undermine the whole <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            concept.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_236" n="236" facs="0260"/>
                        <p>e. The grant military aid programs, sound in concept, have increased the
                            economic and military strength of recipient countries, but generally
                            have not enabled those countries militarily to become self-sustaining
                            and, indeed, have encouraged some of them to demand continued and
                            increasing financial support as the price of their adherence to our
                            alliance. These programs should be examined with definite cut-off dates.
                            In those few instances in which definite cut-off dates are not to our
                            interest the United States should commit itself to establishing
                            specific, definite, long-range support.</p>
                        <p>4. Although the Joint Chiefs of Staff are in agreement that the military
                            elements of the present national strategy have been generally adequate,
                            they are of the opinion that in spite of our military posture, the free
                            world situation is gradually deteriorating. Unless adequate steps are
                            taken to change this trend, the United States will, in a span of a
                            relatively short number of years, be placed in great jeopardy. Our basic
                            national security objectives remain valid to the extent that they are
                            feasible, but require vigorous new actions if they are to be attained or
                            even if their feasibility is to be fully determined. The deterioration
                            of the free world position leads the Joint Chiefs of Staff to the
                            conclusion that either the programs for general strategy have not been
                            resolutely implemented or that the general strategy is inadequate to
                            cope with the situation now confronting the United States as the leader
                            of the free world.</p>
                        <p>5. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have examined the unfavorable situations in
                            which we find ourselves about the world to determine the reasons
                            therefor. They are convinced that the problems confronting the United
                            States leadership of the free world are primarily in the political,
                            social, and psychological fields. The basic national security policy
                            document, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5501, contains statements,
                            which are responsive to previously expressed concern by the Joint Chiefs
                            of Staff, indicating that “Programs for the general strategy between now
                            and the time the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has greatly
                            increased nuclear power should be developed as a matter of urgency.”
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5501 also states “Failure
                            resolutely to pursue this general strategy could, within a relatively
                            short span of years, place the United States in great jeopardy.”
                            (Paragraphs 26, 27, and 28 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            5501)</p>
                        <p>6. The United States has based its national policy on the deterrence of
                            war, large and small. Indispensable visible strength in being is not
                            sufficient in itself for this purpose. It must be reinforced by a
                            world-wide understanding that the United States will use that strength
                            promptly to support national and free world interests when necessary.
                            While our military programs have been reasonably successful in providing
                            visible military strength, the Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that there
                            is a feeling throughout the world that the United States lacks the
                            essential determination to act in time. Slowness of reaction time can be
                                <pb xml:id="pg_237" n="237" facs="0261"/>a critical weakness in the
                            implementaion of any national policy. Decisiveness is endangered by the
                            need to obtain concurrences of our allies and by the requirements of our
                            constitutional processes. Ways to reduce this time of reaction require
                            the attention of all agencies of the government involved in the
                            implementation of our national policy. Our military strength will have
                            little effect if every word and deed of our government and its
                            representatives do not attest our national resolution to act promptly
                            when the moment of decision arrives. We must appreciate the fact that
                            the effect of our free debates and the operation of our free press tend
                            to present a picture of confusion and indecisiveness to the rest of the
                            free world. If this misleading picture can not be corrected, potential
                            aggressors could again mistake the operation of our democratic processes
                            as a sign of national confusion or weakness, with disastrous
                            results.</p>
                        <p>7. The above line of reasoning and the conclusions that stem from it
                            prompt the question as to what can be done to restore the confidence of
                            the free world in our national determination to take necessary action in
                            time. The Joint Chiefs of Staff are certainly not entirely competent to
                            answer that question, but can suggest actons which, if approved and
                            taken, will, in their opinion, enable us better to meet current
                            Communist tactics.</p>
                        <p>a. The Congress should, on request, give the President authority to act
                            quickly in times of crises. This authority should include the use of the
                            Armed Forces of the United States. We have in mind actions such as the
                            passage of the Formosa resolution last year,<note n="3" xml:id="d64fn3">Reference is to H.J. Res. 159, adopted by the House of
                                Representatives on January 25, 1955, and by the Senate on January
                                28, giving the President authority to employ U.S. armed forces as he
                                deemed necessary to secure and protect Formosa and the Pescadores
                                against armed attack.</note> which undoubtedly has prevented the
                            outbreak of hostilities in the Formosa Straits area up to date.</p>
                        <p>b. The Congress should also grant much broader authority than now exists
                            to expend funds or to deliver equipment, without delay, for either
                            military or economic aid projects. At present, the lack of flexibility
                            in the administration of funds makes it difficult to handle emergency
                            situations without much disruption and delay in other important
                            projects.</p>
                        <p>c. Our national policy must not include the requirement that our “major
                            Allies” always concur in our determination to oppose aggression. If
                            there has been any single tendency in the execution of our national
                            security policy which has operated against our national interest in the
                            past few years, it has been an over-concern for the acquiescence of
                            allies in major crises.</p>
                        <p>8. The Joint Chiefs of Staff fully appreciate the fact that the changes
                            recommended in paragraph 7 above may be difficult to attain and
                            recognize that they are far from being a complete solution to our
                            problem. They are unanimous in their opinion, however, that unless <pb xml:id="pg_238" n="238" facs="0262"/>additional flexibility is
                            worked into our national strategy and greater emphasis is placed upon
                            its implementation, it cannot be successful within the limited time
                            period available.</p>

                            representing the thinking of the Joint Chiefs as a result of their week
                            in Puerto Rico. The President read it through, and then said it seemed
                            to give a very dark picture. If this is what we face, it would imply
                            that we should go to field conditions, declare an emergency, increase
                            the military budget, and even go to a garrison state. In that case the
                            Services would have to go to a much more spartan mode of living. The
                            memorandum indicates that the President should have a number of
                            extraordinary powers; he felt that in anything like the present
                            circumstances, such ideas were rather unrealistic. He thought the
                            memorandum seemed to say that the U.S. military position has worsened in
                            the last three years; with that he would not agree. The Soviets have
                            been turned away from the military form of international action. He did
                            not think that we were worse off with regard to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Where we are badly off is with
                            respect to the rising Arab nations in the Middle East.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_239" n="239" facs="0263"/>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> said that we are
                            getting in trouble with our allies, which are putting forward heavy and
                            increasing demands for support—Italy has asked for $290 million a year,
                            with the alternative of cutting back their forces. The Turks question
                            our aid to Egypt when we would not give them the $300 million loan they
                            asked for to strengthen their economic system. He said we are in a
                            period now when we are developing and buying the new weapons, while
                            still procuring the old. It is probably necessary to make great outlays
                            on guided missiles, but they are not the full answer by any means.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the memorandum seemed to say there was a need for
                            an outlay of $38-49 billion for the U.S. military program proper.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> stressed how
                            much money is going into new development—altogether it must come to $5
                            billion a year, including research and development, facilities,
                            procurement of prototypes, etc.</p>
                        <p>The President said there seemed to be a premise that we are the only ones
                            resisting Communism, and that if we are to have allies we must
                            practically pay for their efforts. He thought it might be better to
                            encourage some nations to be neutral. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> said there is increasing
                            difficulty in holding our allies together. He had asked General
                            Gruenther if it wouldn’t be possible to reduce forces in Turkey, Greece
                            and Italy. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said
                            the President was indicating a new policy—that it might be cheaper to
                            maintain certain nations as neutrals. The President said it might be not
                            only a cheaper, but a better and more effective way of obtaining our
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>The President went on to say that the fact that money is needed abroad is
                            not too hard to deal with. These needs can be, and have been, closely
                            studied. It seems much harder, however, to do anything about the stated
                            needs for our own forces—much harder to cut them. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that if we do not build
                            missiles we will soon be having a big bill for supersonic bombers.
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> indicated that
                            we will probably be having such a bill whether we build missiles or not.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that the
                            memorandum makes it clear, as he had in his discussion with the
                            President at Gettysburg, that our program is really several billion
                            dollars larger than our funding at the present time. This is possible
                            only because of reductions in carry-over, and other savings, and most of
                            these now are “one time” savings. The President asked why it is not
                            possible to cut manpower, particularly in the Army and the Marines.
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> said that
                            overseas commanders will not agree to make cuts in their areas.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that if we
                            don’t make some cuts, we will continue with a program that exceeds our
                            funding. He was disposed to agree with the Chiefs in their views, unless
                            some basic policy changes were made.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_240" n="240" facs="0264"/>
                        <p>The President said we have taken in many areas such a strong
                            anti-communist line that our allies are able to make demands on us, and
                            claim that they are fighting our fight for us. He went on to say that in
                            terms of our over-all military program we can’t prepare everything that
                            might be desirable, and can’t be strong everywhere. The real question is
                            where to take the risks. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> referred to costs that are being experienced
                            through losses of aircraft. This figure, he thought, is now up toward a
                            billion dollars a year. He wondered if flying hours might be reduced.
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> thought they
                            should be kept up in order to maintain proficiency. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> referred to a study now being
                            made by General LeMay<note n="3" xml:id="d65fn3">The study prepared by
                                General Curtis LeMay, Commander of the Strategic Air Command, has
                                not been found in the Eisenhower Library or Department of State
                                files.</note> which involves operating comparable units at different
                            numbers of hours per month.</p>
                        <p>The President said the paper ought to show first what we have
                            accomplished in three years. If, after careful analysis of this, the
                            Chiefs then said we must increase, he wouldn’t disagree. Next it should
                            deal with the foreign field. We must keep <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">shape</gloss> but get
                            other nations to face up to their responsibilities to carry on
                            themselves. Then it must consider what is the maximum we can expect to
                            get from arms. An adverse result is indicated by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ reports of the extreme concern
                            of India over Pakistan’s military strength. It must analyze where the
                            biggest return in security for the dollar can be obtained.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> referred to the
                            cumbersome and slow-moving administration and performance on our aid
                            commitments. The President said he would certainly like to get this
                            straightened out. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>s overseas are too large. The President said he felt
                            the trouble was right around Washington.</p>
                        <p>The President thought the paper should be reorganized to show first the
                            domestic military problem. This should cover a review of the U.S.
                            military position vis-à-vis that of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. It should explain the progress that has been made in
                            the last four years. It should bring out that missiles are now coming
                            along. It must then ask what guided missiles mean to us in a military
                            sense. Also, it should consider whether the highly technological
                            services, like the Air Force and Navy Air, are not getting somewhat
                            old-fashioned in their thinking and composition. Next the paper should
                            consider our alliances—what we must do to keep up confidence and
                            maintain the alignment of free world countries, how to be selective in
                            what we support, and how to correct the idea that “we are fighting your
                            war.”</p>

                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> said with
                            reference to our allied arrangements that the British may drop joint
                            planning with us with regard to Israel. The President said that Israeli
                            distrust of the British is such that this action may improve our
                            position at least with the Israeli rather than weakening it.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that as he
                            looked at the matter more military strength than we had over the past
                            three years would not have bettered us in our international position
                            during that period.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the paper seemed to create a misleading
                            impression, and repeated that it should be organized into three parts,
                            the first the domestic military situation, including the place and role
                            of the missile; our present situation; the adequacy or excess of present
                            force levels. Next would be considered the world military situation, and
                            the whole situation in the free world.<note n="4" xml:id="d65fn4">In a

                                organization of the Joint Chiefs’ views suggested by the President.”
                                This attached outline was divided into three main categories:
                                Domestic Military Situation (or Problem); Our Alliances (Free World

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that General
                            LeMay is talking in terms of 1800 B–52s. <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> wants 800. The question is up as to whether a
                            wing should include 30 or 45 aircraft. If 45, should the number of wings
                            be decreased?</p>
                        <p>The President said that he urges each Chief of Staff to take the same
                            attitude toward the importance of a sound economy as he knows Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> does—to recognize it
                            as a fundamental element of over-all U.S. security strength. He also
                            said that in many areas of the world he is inclined to have more faith
                            now in economic aid to meet current problems than in military aid.</p>

                            forces referred to in paragraph 32 and other appropriate paragraphs of
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5501, to deal with local

                        <p>d. Agreed that the Council, after submission to the President of the
                            report on the subject now in preparation by the Chairman, Council on
                            Foreign Economic Policy, should give further consideration to basic U.S.

                        <p>e. Requested that a presentation to the Council on the problem of

                            Welfare on those aspects of the presentation respecting the educational
                            objectives in the United States.</p>
                        <p>f. Agreed that intensive efforts should be continued on all aspects of

                        <p>g. Requested the Operations Coordinating Board, with the participation of
                            the Department of Justice, to prepare a study of the factors involved in
                            implementing paragraph 35 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602,
                            dealing with free world-Communist bloc contacts; and directed the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning Board to review pertinent
                            policies (particularly <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5508/1 and

                        <p rend="center">Preamble</p>
                        <p>1. The spiritual, moral and material posture of the United States of
                            America rests upon established principles which have been asserted and
                            defended throughout the history of the Republic. The genius, strength
                            and promise of America are founded in the dedication of its people and
                            government to the dignity, equality and freedom of the human being under
                            God. These concepts and our institutions which nourish and maintain them
                            with justice are the bulwark of our free society and are the basis of
                            the respect and leadership which have been accorded our nation by the
                            peoples of the world. When they are challenged, our response must be
                            resolute and worthy of our heritage. From this premise must derive our
                            national will and the policies which express it. The continuing full
                            exercise of our individual and collective responsibilities is required
                            to realize the basic objective of our national security policies:
                            maintaining the security of the United States and the vitality of its
                            fundamental values and institutions.</p>

                            its Communist ideology and international apparatus.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">The basic problem</hi> confronting the United States
                            is how, without undermining fundamental U.S. values and institutions or
                            seriously weakening the U.S. economy, to meet and ultimately to reduce
                            to acceptable proportions this threat to U.S. security.</p>
                        <p>5. The United States and its allies have no foreseeable prospect of
                            stopping the growth of Soviet nuclear capabilities and of reducing
                            Soviet armed strength—the core of Communist power—or of significantly
                            reducing other basic Communist military strength, except by mutually
                            acceptable agreements with the Soviets or by large-scale <pb xml:id="pg_245" n="245" facs="0269"/>military action. The initiation
                            by the United States of such military action for this purpose is not an
                            acceptable course either to the United States or its major allies.</p>
                        <p>6. Hence, U.S. policies must be designed (1) to affect the conduct and
                            policies of the Communist regimes, especially those of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, in ways that further U.S. security
                            interests (including safeguarded disarmament); and (2) to foster
                            tendencies that lead them to abandon expansionist policies. In pursuing
                            this general strategy, our effort should be directed to:</p>
                        <p>a. Deterring further Communist aggression, and preventing the occurrence
                            of total war so far as compatible with U.S. security.</p>
                        <p>b. Maintaining and developing in the free world the mutuality of interest
                            and common purpose, the confidence in the United States, and the will,
                            strength and stability necessary to face the Soviet-Communist threat and
                            to provide constructive and attractive alternatives to Communism, which
                            sustain the hope and confidence of the free peoples.</p>
                        <p>c. In addition to a and b above, taking other actions designed to foster
                            changes in the character and policies of the Soviet-Communist bloc
                            regimes:</p>
                        <list type="ordered">
                            <item>(1) By influencing them and their peoples toward the choice of
                                those alternative lines of action which, while in their national
                                interests, do not conflict with the security interests of the United
                                States.</item>
                            <item>(2) By exploiting differences between such regimes to disrupt the
                                structure of the Soviet-Communist bloc.</item>
                            <item>(3) By exploiting vulnerabilities within the bloc countries in
                                ways consistent with this general strategy.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>d. Destroying or neutralizing the international Communist apparatus in
                            the free world.</p>
                        <p>7. To carry out effectively this general strategy will require a flexible
                            combination of military, political, economic, psychological, and covert
                            actions which enables the full exercise of U.S. initiative. These
                            actions must be so coordinated as to reinforce one another. Programs for
                            carrying out this general strategy should be developed and conducted as
                            a matter of urgency, with special emphasis in the period before the
                            Soviets achieve nuclear parity.</p>
                        <p>8. Provided that it is resolutely pursued, this general strategy offers
                            the best hope of bringing about at least a prolonged period of armed
                            truce, and ultimately a peaceful resolution of the Soviet bloc-free
                            world conflict and a peaceful and orderly world environment. Failure
                            resolutely to pursue this general strategy could, within a relatively
                            short span of years, place the United States in great jeopardy.</p>

                        <p rend="center">Section B</p>
                        <p rend="center">Elements of National Strategy</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. Military Elements of National Strategy</p>
                        <p>9. A central aim of U.S. policy must be to deter the Communists from use
                            of their military power, remaining prepared to fight general war should
                            one be forced upon the United States. This stress on deterrence is
                            dictated by the disastrous character of total nuclear war, the
                            possibility of local conflicts developing into total war, and the
                            serious effect of further Communist aggression. Hence the Communist
                            rulers must be convinced that aggression will not serve their interests:
                            that it will not pay.</p>
                        <p>10. If this purpose is to be achieved, the United States and its allies
                            in the aggregate will have to have, for an indefinite period, military
                            forces with sufficient strength, flexibility and mobility to enable them
                            to deal swiftly and severely with Communist overt aggression in its
                            various forms and to cope successfully with general war should it
                            develop. In addition, the deterrent is much more likely to be effective
                            if the United States and its major allies show that they are united in
                            their determination to use military force against such aggression.</p>
                        <p>11. It is the policy of the United States to integrate nuclear weapons
                            with other weapons in the arsenal of the United States. Nuclear weapons
                            will be used in general war and in military operations short of general
                            war as authorized by the President. Such authorization as may be given
                            in advance will be determined by the President.</p>
                        <p>12. To the extent that the military effectiveness of the armed forces
                            will be enhanced by their use, the United States will be prepared to use
                            chemical and bacteriological weapons in general war. The decision as to
                            their use will be made by the President.</p>
                        <p>13. If time permits and an attack on the United States or U.S. forces is
                            not involved, the United States should consult appropriate allies before
                            any decision to use nuclear, chemical or bacteriological weapons is made
                            by the President.</p>
                        <p>14. In carrying out the central aim of deterring general war, the United
                            States must develop and maintain as part of its military forces its
                            effective nuclear retaliatory power, and must keep that power secure
                            from neutralization or from a Soviet knockout blow, even by surprise.
                            The United States must also continue accelerated military and
                            non-military programs for continental defense. So long as the Soviets
                            are uncertain of their ability to neutralize the U.S. nuclear
                            retaliatory power, there is little reason to expect them deliberately to
                                <pb xml:id="pg_247" n="247" facs="0271"/>initiate general war or
                            actions which they believe would carry appreciable risk of general war,
                            and thereby endanger the regime and the security of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>15. Within the total U.S. military forces there must be included ready
                            forces which, with such help as may realistically be expected from
                            allied forces, are adequate (a) to present a deterrent to any resort to
                            local aggression, and (b) to defeat or hold, in conjunction with
                            indigenous forces, any such local aggression, pending the application of
                            such additional U.S. and allied power as may be required to suppress
                            quickly the local aggression in a manner and on a scale best calculated
                            to avoid the hostilities broadening into general war. Such ready forces
                            must be sufficiently versatile to use both conventional and nuclear
                            weapons. They must be highly mobile and suitably deployed, recognizing
                            that some degree of maldeployment from the viewpoint of general war must
                            be accepted. Such forces must not become so dependent on tactical
                            nuclear capabilities that any decision to intervene against local
                            aggression would probably be tantamount to a decision to use nuclear
                            weapons. However, these forces must also have a flexible and selective
                            nuclear capability, since the United States will not preclude itself
                            from using nuclear weapons even in a local situation.</p>
                        <p>16. With the coming of nuclear parity, the ability to apply force
                            selectively and flexibly will become increasingly important in
                            maintaining the morale and will of the free world to resist aggression.
                            The United States and its allies must avoid getting themselves in a
                            position where they must choose between (a) not responding to local
                            aggression and (b) applying force in a way which our own people or our
                            allies would consider entails undue risks of nuclear devastation. The
                            apprehensions of U.S. allies as to using nuclear weapons to counter
                            local aggression can be lessened if the U.S. deterrent force is not
                            solely dependent on such weapons, thus avoiding the question of their
                            use unless and until the deterrent fails. In the event of actual
                            Communist local aggression, the United States should, if necessary, make
                            its own decision as to the use of nuclear weapons. In the last analysis,
                            when confronted by the choice (a) acquiescing in Communist aggression or
                            (b) taking measures risking either general war or loss of allied
                            support, the United States must be prepared to take these risks if
                            necessary for its security.</p>
                        <p>17. National security policy is predicated upon the support and
                            cooperation of appropriate major allies and certain other free world
                            countries, in furnishing bases for U.S. military power and in providing
                            their share of military forces. It is important for the United States to
                            take the necessary steps to convince its allies, particularly its <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies, that U.S. strategy and policy
                            serve their security as well as its own, and that the United States is
                            committed to their defense and <pb xml:id="pg_248" n="248" facs="0272"/>possesses the capability to fulfill that commitment. The United States
                            should strengthen as practicable the collective defense system and
                            utilize, where appropriate, the possibilities of collective action
                            through the UN. The United States should provide new weapons
                            (non-nuclear) and advanced technology to allies capable of using them
                            effectively, taking into account the protection of classified data, the
                            essential requirements of U.S. forces, production capabilities and the
                            likely availability of funds. Atomic energy legislation as it relates to
                            weapons should be progressively relaxed to the extent required for the
                            progressive integration of such weapons into <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defenses, to the extent of enabling selected allies to
                            be able to use them upon the outbreak of war. The United States should
                            continue to provide military and other assistance, including where
                            deemed appropriate new weapons and advanced techology, to dependable
                            allied nations where such assistance is necessary to enable them to make
                            their appropriate contributions to collective military power. Special
                            attention in the technological field should be directed to assisting
                            selected U.S. allies rapidly to develop their own advanced weapons
                            systems, and in other ways significantly to increase utilization of free
                            world scientific and technological resources.</p>
                        <p>18. The United States and its allies must reject the concept of
                            preventive war or acts intended to provoke war. Hence, the United States
                            should attempt to make clear, by word and conduct, that it is not our
                            intention to provoke war. At the same time the United States and its
                            major allies must make clear their determination to oppose aggression
                            despite risk of general war; and the United States must make clear its
                            determination to prevail if general war eventuates.</p>
                        <p>19. Dynamic research and development for military application are a
                            necessity for the continued maintenance of an adequate U.S. military
                            posture and effective armed forces. Without increasing effectiveness in
                            the research and development field, U.S. weaponry may in the future fall
                            qualitatively behind that of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            with concomitant danger to U.S. security. U.S. research and development
                            must be carried out with full recognition of this potential danger.
                            Moreover, the United States must speed up, by all practicable steps, the
                            means whereby important scientific discoveries can be translated into an
                            appropriate flow of new weapons to the armed forces.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>20. The United States should place more stress than heretofore on
                            building the strength and cohesion of the free world, and take adequate
                            actions for the purpose of (a) creating cohesion within and among all
                            the free nations, remedying their weaknesses, and steadily <pb xml:id="pg_249" n="249" facs="0273"/>improving the relative position
                            of the free world; (b) destroying the effectiveness of the Communist
                            apparatus in the free world; and (c) combatting the effects of Soviet
                            bloc diplomatic and economic activities in the free world. Success in
                            these endeavors will depend heavily on the degree to which the United
                            States and its major allies can attain agreement on objectives and
                            actions to achieve them, consistent with basic U.S. objectives.</p>
                        <p>21. Direct action against the Communist apparatus must rest largely with
                            the local governments concerned, although the United States should be
                            able to help significantly [<hi rend="italic">4 words not

                            United States should, as one of its objectives, assist in the
                            development of adequate internal security forces. [<hi rend="italic">1

                        <p>22. In combatting Soviet subversive forces and techniques, the United
                            States should develop and employ in a well-coordinated manner [<hi rend="italic">5 words not declassified</hi>] political, information,
                            economic and military programs and activities. In particular, the United
                            States should seek to alert countries which become targets of the new
                            Soviet campaign of diplomatic and economic penetration to the dangers of
                            subversion to which this campaign subjects them. [<hi rend="italic">1

                        <p>23. In the face of divisions, fears, and weaknesses, which in many cases
                            the Communists can exploit, the United States must choose between (a)
                            taking timely action to help remedy such conditions, or (b) allowing the
                            situation to deteriorate with the prospect of later trying to prevent
                            Communist gains by more costly and less certain measures, or even
                            military action. The ability of the free world, over the long pull, to
                            meet the challenge and competition of the Communist world will depend in
                            large measure on the capacity to demonstrate progress toward meeting the
                            basic needs and aspirations of its peoples.</p>
                        <p>24. Two of the basic problems in the economic field are: (a)
                            industrialized areas require further economic growth and expanded trade;
                            and (b) the less developed areas seek to develop and modernize their
                            economies and must also maintain a substantial volume of exports of
                            primary products. It should be within the capacity of the free world,
                            with U.S. initiative and leadership, to turn these two problems into
                            mutually supporting assets for the promotion of appropriate economic
                            strength and growth.</p>
                        <p>25. A necessary condition for such strength and growth is a high level of
                            international trade within the free world. In order to foster this, the
                            United States should (a) continue to press strongly for a general
                            reduction of barriers to such trade; (b) take the lead by reducing
                            further its own tariffs and other trade restrictions over the next few
                                <pb xml:id="pg_250" n="250" facs="0274"/>years, with due regard to
                            national security and total national advantage; and (c) also support
                            sound moves to widen the convertibility of currencies.</p>
                        <p>26. a. The United States should encourage and support movements toward
                            European unity, especially those leading to supra-national institutions,
                            bearing in mind that the basic initiative must come from the Europeans
                            themselves.</p>
                        <p>b. The United States may find it expedient to continue economic
                            assistance to certain European countries, such as Spain, Yugoslavia and
                            Turkey, to assist them in achieving stability and growth while
                            maintaining necessary military forces.</p>
                        <p>27. The dangers to free world stability are particularly acute in the
                            less developed areas, and are enhanced by recent Soviet initiatives. The
                            task of speeding up their economic growth, providing adequate dietary
                            conditions, and promoting stability presents a multitude of problems,
                            political and social as well as economic. For example, it calls for some
                            changes in traditional habits and attitudes and for greatly expanded
                            training in administrative and technical skills. In any case, new
                            capital investment is a prerequisite to growth. Utilization of private
                            investment should be encouraged to the maximum feasible extent. Local
                            capital will have to be supplemented by the provision of capital from
                            abroad. In addition to external public and private investment and IBRD
                            loans, substantial financing from U.S. public funds (including the
                            Export-Import Bank) will be necessary, in some cases over an extended
                            period, to help achieve the economic progress essential to U.S.
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>28. a. The United States should be prepared to use economic means
                            available to it to promote conditions of sound development in less
                            developed nations where:</p>
                        <p>(1) The political and economic situation is important to the security of
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>(2) Such development cannot be financed by local capital or other
                            non-communist foreign assistance.</p>
                        <p>(3) Such assistance will be effectively used.</p>
                        <p>U.S. economic assistance world-wide should be at but not exceed a total
                            level consistent with U.S. security interests.</p>
                        <p>b. U.S. foreign economic programs should be designed to:</p>
                        <p>(1) Achieve our objective of promoting conditions of sound development in
                            less developed nations in order to retain and strengthen them as members
                            of the free world.</p>
                        <p>(2) Demonstrate to these nations that they can progress economically
                            without becoming dependent upon the soviet bloc or endangering their
                            independence.</p>
                        <p>(3) Counter so far as practicable the apparent attractiveness and
                            damaging effects of the Soviet bloc economic offensive.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_251" n="251" facs="0275"/>
                        <p>c. In order to make the most effective use of economic aid resources and
                            to facilitate planning of longer-term projects and programs necessary
                            for economic development, the Executive Branch should have
                            authority:</p>
                        <p>(1) To make commitments extending over a period of years for assistance
                            to such projects and programs.</p>
                        <p>(2) To modify existing requirements as to administration and supervision
                            of aid programs and the conditions on which aid may be granted.</p>
                        <p>(3) To exercise greater flexibility in planning, timing and
                            administration of economic aid programs.</p>
                        <p>29. U.S. financial assistance alone cannot produce satisfactory economic
                            growth in less developed areas, and external assistance should be used
                            in a way to promote and not decrease local incentives and self-help. In
                            addition to the provision of financial assistance, the United States
                            should train indigenous leaders, develop skills, and provide competent
                            advisers.</p>
                        <p>30. U.S. political policies must be adapted to conditions prevailing in
                            each less developed area. The United States should not exert pressure to
                            make active allies of countries not so inclined, but should recognize
                            that the independence of such countries from Communism serves U.S.
                            interests even though they are not aligned with the United States. The
                            United States should provide assistance on the basis of the will and
                            ability of such countries to defend and strengthen their independence,
                            and should take other feasible steps which will strengthen their
                            capacity to do so.</p>
                        <p>31. The United States cannot afford the loss to Communist extremism of
                            constructive nationalist and reform movements in colonial areas in Asia
                            and Africa. The United States should seek (a) to work with, rather than
                            against, such forces when convinced they are likely to remain powerful
                            and grow in influence; and (b) to prevent the capture of such forces by
                            Communism. Where disputes or tensions involve the relations of a major
                            U.S. ally with a colonial or dependent area, the United States should
                            use its influence in behalf of an orderly evolution of political
                            arrangements toward self-determination and should seek to strengthen the
                            forces of moderation in both the colonial and metropolitan areas.</p>
                        <p>32. The United States should continue its full support of and active
                            leadership in the United Nations and specialized agencies, and should
                            seek to make maximum use of the UN for the settlement of international
                            disputes and as an instrument of collective security. The UN forum,
                            moreover, can serve and should be used as an effective means to mobilize
                            free world opinion in support of U.S. policies, to expose Soviet
                            propaganda and activities, and to exploit the vulnerabilities of Soviet
                            management of the satellite empire.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_252" n="252" facs="0276"/>
                        <p>33. The United States should actively continue to carry out its programs
                            for the peaceful uses of atomic energy in order to maintain U.S.
                            leadership and initiative in this field.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">B. Means of Directly Influencing the Communist
                                bloc</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>34. a. The primary means for influencing Soviet conduct must be adequate
                            political, military, and economic programs and actions. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Communist China cannot be
                            expected to revise their methods of operation or their practical goals
                            more conformably to U.S. interest unless further Communist expansion is
                            prevented, present Communist techniques of pressure and inducement are
                            effectively countered, and the relative position of the free world is
                            manifestly improved.</p>
                        <p>b. The free world has in addition such specific means of influencing
                            Soviet conduct as East-West relations, the negotiating process, and the
                            exploitation of Soviet bloc vulnerabilities. U.S. policies on each of
                            these subjects should be designed to achieve a consistent effect and
                            should be carried out so as to be compatible with basic national
                            security strategy and so as not to weaken the will to resist Communism
                            in the free world.</p>
                        <p>35. In utilizing East-West relations, negotiations and exploitation of
                            vulnerabilities to influence Soviet conduct, the United States should
                            seek (a) to reduce the likelihood or capability of Soviet aggression or
                            subversive expansion; (b) to give to the Communist regimes a clear
                            conception of the true U.S. and free world purposes, including
                            uncompromising U.S. determination to resist Communist aggressive moves
                            and uphold freedom; (c) to convince the Communist leaders that
                            alternatives exist to their present policies which would be acceptable
                            to the United States and which they might come to consider compatible
                            with their own security interests; (d) to correct the distorted image of
                            the West which has been sedulously cultivated for years inside the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>; (e) to encourage the
                            Communist regimes to take measures which would make more difficult a
                            reversal of peaceful policy and which might over the long run lead to
                            basic changes in the outlook or character of Communist regimes.</p>
                        <p>36. In East-West relations the United States should continue to sponsor
                            proposals for a selective expansion of free world-Communist bloc
                            contacts, which are chosen with a view to:</p>
                        <p>a. Maintaining free world initiative and leadership for genuinely
                            reciprocal reductions of the barriers to free communications and
                            peaceful trade;</p>
                        <p>b. Increasing the acquisition of useful intelligence concerning the
                            Communist bloc; and</p>
                        <p>c. Avoiding a net disadvantage to the United States from such contacts;
                                <pb xml:id="pg_253" n="253" facs="0277"/>and which, if accepted,
                            would favor evolution in the Soviet society and economy toward peaceful
                            development, or, if rejected, would expose the persistence of
                            expansionism behind the facade of Soviet tactics and propaganda. In
                            considering proposals for such free world–Communist bloc contacts, the
                            United States should take account of the effect of the U.S. example upon
                            other free nations more vulnerable to Communist penetration.</p>
                        <p>37. The United States should continue its readiness to negotiate with the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> whenever it appears that U.S.
                            security interests will be served thereby. Such negotiations have
                            additional importance in maintaining free world initiative and cohesion,
                            and are desirable in order to probe the intentions and expose the
                            meaning of Soviet policies. The United States and its major allies
                            should be prepared to sponsor genuinely reciprocal concessions between
                            the free world and the Communist bloc which would leave unimpaired the
                            net security position of the free world and would contribute to the
                            ultimate peaceful resolution of the Communist threat. The United States
                            should not, however, make concessions in advance of similar action by
                            the Soviets, in the hope of inspiring Soviet concessions. Until the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> evidences a modification of
                            its basic hostility toward the non-Communist world through concrete
                            actions, agreements should be dependent upon a balance of advantages to
                            the non-Communist world and not upon implied good will or trust in
                            written agreements.</p>
                        <p>38. The United States in its own interest should, as interrelated parts
                            of its national policy, actively seek a comprehensive, phased and
                            safeguarded international system for the regulation and reduction of
                            armed forces and armaments; concurrently, in related, parallel steps,
                            make intensive efforts to resolve other major international issues; and
                            meanwhile continue the steady development of strength in the United
                            States and in the free world coalition required for U.S. security. As
                            the initial step in this international arms system, the United States
                            should give priority to early agreement on and implementation of (a)
                            such confidence-building measures as the exchange of military
                            blueprints, mutual aerial inspection and establishment of ground control
                            posts at strategic centers; and (b) all such measures of adequately
                            safeguarded disarmament as are now feasible. The acceptability and
                            character of any international system for the regulation and reduction
                            of armed forces and armaments depend primarily on the scope and
                            effectiveness of the safeguards against violations and evasions, and
                            especially the inspection system.</p>
                        <p>39. In the exploitation of Soviet bloc vulnerabilities, the United States
                            should design its policies and programs (a) to promote evolutionary
                            changes in Soviet policies and conduct in ways that further U.S. and
                            free world security; (b) to weaken the ties which link the <pb xml:id="pg_254" n="254" facs="0278"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Communist China and bind their
                            satellites; (c) to encourage bureaucratic and popular pressures inside
                            the bloc for greater emphasis by the regimes on their internal problems,
                            and on national interests in the satellites; and (d) to undermine the
                            faith of the Communist ruling classes in their own system and ideology.
                            The effort should be to pose for them the necessity of devoting
                            attention and resources to these needs or facing increased disaffection
                            with the regime or the satellite relationship if these needs are
                            ignored.</p>
                        <p>40. In applying this strategy to Communist China the United States must
                            take account of non-recognition of the regime, the hostility of the
                            regime, its aggressive policy, and the undesirability of enhancing the
                            power and influence of Communist China relative to free Asian nations.
                            Moreover, the United States should not overlook any possibility, however
                            remote, of fostering among the Chinese people demands for an alternative
                            to the Communist regime. However, the United States should continue its
                            willingness to participate in talks with, or including, Communist China
                            on specific subjects on an ad hoc basis where the general objectives of
                            its political strategy against the Communist bloc would be served
                            thereby.</p>

                            policies. These programs should be materially strengthened. U.S.
                            policies and actions should be presented in a manner which will advance
                            U.S. objectives, and their psychological implication should be carefully
                            considered in advance.</p>

                            should seek to (1) project an image of the United States which reflects
                            the fundamentally peaceful intent of U.S. policies, while making clear
                            our determination to resist aggression; (2) delineate those important
                            aspects of U.S. life, culture and institutions which facilitate

                            persuade foreign peoples that U.S. objectives will actually aid the

                            expose Communist aims and actions and adequately counter Soviet

                            along lines consistent with U.S. security objectives and the legitimate

                            Security Measures</p>
                        <p>42. <hi rend="italic">Sound U.S. Economy</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>a. A strong, healthy and expanding U.S. economy is essential to the
                            security and stability of the free world. The level of expenditures for
                            national security programs must take into full account the danger to the
                            United States and its allies resulting from impairment, through
                            inflation or the undermining of incentives, of the basic soundness of
                            the U.S. economy or of the continuing expansion of the U.S. economy
                            under a free enterprise system.</p>
                        <p>b. The Federal Government should continue to make a determined effort to
                            bring its total annual expenditures and its total annual revenues into
                            balance, or into substantial balance; and should maintain over-all
                            credit and fiscal policies designed to assist in stabilizing the
                            economy.</p>
                        <p>c. Nevertheless, the United States must continue to meet the necessary
                            costs of the programs essential for its security.</p>
                        <p>d. All Federal expenditures, especially those not essential for the
                            national security, should be held to a necessary minimum. Every effort
                            should be made to eliminate waste, duplication, and unnecessary overhead
                            in the Federal Government.</p>
                        <p>e. The United States should also seek (1) to maintain a higher and
                            expanding rate of economic activity at relatively stable price levels,
                            and (2) to maximize the economic potential of private enterprise by
                            minimizing governmental controls and regulations and by encouraging
                            private enterprise to develop natural and technological resources (e.g.
                            nuclear power).</p>
                        <p>43. <hi rend="italic">Internal Security.</hi> Internal security measures
                            should be made adequate, by strengthening them as necessary, to meet the
                            threat to U.S. security of covert attack by the Soviet bloc on the
                            United States by means of sabotage, subversion, espionage, and
                            particularly, the clandestine introduction and detonation of nuclear
                            weapons.</p>
                        <p>44. <hi rend="italic">Civil Defense.</hi> An essential ingredient of our
                            domestic strength is an improved and strengthened civil defense program
                            which seeks, by both preventive and ameliorative measures, to minimize
                            damage from nuclear attack, including the effects of increasingly
                            powerful weapons.</p>
                        <p>45. <hi rend="italic">Support by U.S. Citizens</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>a. No national strategy to meet the Soviet threat can be successful
                            without the support of the American people. During a time of increasing
                            Soviet nuclear power, the determination of U.S. citizens to face the
                            risks involved in carrying out such national strategy will be of
                            increasing importance. Continuing efforts should be made to inform the
                            American people of the demands on their spiritual and material resources
                                <pb xml:id="pg_256" n="256" facs="0280"/>necessary to ensure U.S.
                            security by political, military and economic means during a period of
                            armed truce, which may either continue for many years or be broken by an
                            atomic war.</p>
                        <p>b. Eternal vigilance is necessary in carrying out the national strategy,
                            to prevent the intimidation of free criticism. Necessary protective
                            measures should not be used to destroy national unity, which must be
                            based on freedom and not on fear.</p>
                        <p>46. <hi rend="italic">Mobilization Base</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>a. Inasmuch as no one can foresee with certainty the nature and extent of
                            future conflicts in which the United States may become involved, the
                            national mobilization base must be so constituted as to maintain
                            military readiness to enter combat, ranging from local to general war,
                            and to provide the capability of meeting expeditiously the needs of our
                            national effort to bring hostilities to an early and successful
                            conclusion. Such a requirement demands a mobilization base:</p>
                        <p>(1) Adequate to maintain modern forces in being capable of successfully
                            meeting and delivering the initial nuclear offensives, carrying out the
                            other essential tasks in the early phases of general war, and conducting
                            operations short of general war.</p>
                        <p>(2) Adequate, with appropriate war reserves, to support the prosecution
                            of the succeeding phases of general war including support for the forces
                            likely to be involved therein and for minimum essential civilian
                            needs.</p>
                        <p>(3) Adequate to provide for prompt replenishment of the general war
                            reserves which might be expended in military operations less than
                            general war.</p>
                        <p>b. The mobilization base should be predicated upon approved war
                            plans.</p>
                        <p>47. <hi rend="italic">Stockpiling.</hi> For planning the stockpile
                            objectives for strategic and critical materials, a period of five years
                            may be used. However, only the stockpile objectives based upon the
                            planning period of three years currently used in Military Mobilization
                            Planning should be completed on a priority basis, the remainder of the
                            five-year objectives to be achieved on a longer and lower priority
                            basis. The stockpiling program should not normally be used to help
                            stabilize international markets for exports of less developed countries;
                            exceptions being made only on a case-by-case basis where there would be
                            a clear net advantage to the United States.</p>
                        <p>48. <hi rend="italic">Intelligence.</hi> The United States should develop
                            and maintain an intelligence system capable of collecting the requisite

                        <p>a. Indications of hostile intentions that would give maximum prior
                            warning of possible aggression or subversion in any area of the
                            world.</p>
                        <p>b. The capabilities of foreign countries, friendly and neutral as well as

                            mid-1956 the capability to mount a decisive nuclear strike against the

                                eliminated, or (2) civil, political, and cultural life is reduced to
                                a condition of chaos. “Strike” means an action carried to completion
                                within hours or days, as compared to an “offensive” which is of
                                longer duration. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> The United

                            blow at the United States, but the United States should still be able to
                            inflict equal or greater damage on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, provided that it takes adequate steps to protect and
                            to continue the development of its effective retaliatory power.</p>
                        <p>2. In an attack on the United States, especially a surprise attack, the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, at least until it develops a
                            long-range ballistic missile capability, would place chief reliance on
                            nuclear attacks by aircraft. Also, substantial launching of missiles
                            from submarines would be possible, and clandestine methods could be used
                            against specially selected targets. Chemical and biological capabilities
                            would probably be employed as secondary means of attack. In any event,
                            the most probable primary objective of an initial Soviet nuclear strike
                            would be the earliest possible destruction of U.S. and allied nuclear
                            capability, world-wide; but this would almost certainly be combined with
                            attacks on other U.S. and major allied forces and war reserves, and on
                            key production complexes.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Chances of General War.</hi> A situation is
                            approaching in which a total war involving use by both sides of
                            available nuclear weapons could bring about such extensive destruction
                            as to threaten the survival of both Western civilization and the Soviet
                            system. This could well result in a condition of mutual deterrence, in
                            which each side would be strongly inhibited from deliberately initiating
                            general war or taking actions which it regarded as materially increasing
                            the risk of general war. However, general war will remain a possibility
                            if only <pb xml:id="pg_259" n="259" facs="0283"/>because of the element
                            of miscalculation by either side. General war would also be a
                            possibility in the event that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>,
                            either because of an unexpected technological breakthrough or for other
                            reasons, came to believe that it could destroy the United States without
                            effective retaliation. Moreover, general war might occur as the climax
                            of a series of actions and counteractions which neither side originally
                            intended to lead to general war. In an era of rapid technological
                            change, it is always possible that a condition of nuclear stalemate will
                            prove transitory; much will depend upon which side can acquire or
                            maintain technological superiority.</p>

                            and Soviet progress in guided missiles, especially surface-to-surface,
                            could have a crucial bearing on relative over-all capabilities, both
                            political and military:</p>
                        <p>a. The Soviets will probably obtain a limited operational capability in
                            an 850-900-mile ballistic missile in the near future; a 1400-mile
                            ballistic missile (with a low-yield warhead) in 1957; and a 1600-mile
                            ballistic missile in 1958, with a high-yield warhead in 1959. Most of
                            our overseas bases are within 1600 miles of the Soviet launching sites.
                            With the accelerated emphasis now being given the U.S. development
                            program, the United States should have a limited operational capability
                            in a 1500-mile ballistic missile (with a high-yield warhead) by early
                            1959. It is possible that the Soviets could demonstrate a 1400-mile
                            ballistic missile at any time; but the U.S. will not have this
                            capability until 1957 or 1958.</p>
                        <p>b. With intensive effort, which must be assumed, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could have a limited operational
                            capability with an intercontinental ballistic missile with a high-yield
                            nuclear warhead by 1960–61. This weapons system will create a direct and
                            dangerous threat to the continental United States. With the accelerated
                            emphasis given the U.S. <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program
                            under current plans, the United States may be able to equal this
                            timetable. There is no available direct defense against the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> at this time except a technically
                            feasible detection system. However, studies and proposals suggest that
                            the development of a weapons system with worthwhile defensive
                            capabilities may be possible, if vigorously pursued.</p>
                        <p>5. By 1958, in addition to other short-range missiles: (a) both the
                            United States and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> are likely
                            to have operational surface-to-air missiles with nuclear warheads: (b)
                            the United States will have, and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> may have, operational air-to-air missiles with nuclear
                            warheads.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Bloc Military Capabilities.</hi> The Communist Bloc
                            will maintain and further develop the effectiveness of its formidable
                            conventional forces. The principal limitations will be logistic problems
                            and deficiencies in specialized experience, training and equipment. Such
                            reductions in force levels as may have been made are likely to be offset
                            by improved combat effectiveness of remaining forces, and Soviet ability
                                <pb xml:id="pg_260" n="260" facs="0284"/>to mobilize massive forces
                            rapidly will be unimpaired. The Soviets have stepped up their submarine
                            building program to about 100 vessels a year. Soviet strategic and
                            tactical doctrine and training procedures, moreover, now emphasize the
                            advantage of surprise and provide for the integration of nuclear and
                            chemical weapons in the operations of conventional forces. In the Far
                            East, Communist China is increasing its already formidable military
                            strength, although it remains substantially dependent on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for equipment and logistic

                            been improved, both in delivery capabilities and in weapons quality. The
                            U.S. Continental Air Defense System has also been improved. Other U.S.
                            forces have been augmented with improved weapon and missile
                            capabilities, and with modernized equipment. Those committed to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the Far East are in a high state
                            of readiness, with an atomic capability. In some geographical areas, the
                            U.S. response to local aggression by other than air or naval striking
                            forces would be slow and limited, and would in any case require the
                            temporary diversion of forces, transportation, and other resources from
                            planned initial tasks in a general war. The improvement in the
                            capabilities of all U.S. forces is due in the main to the integration of
                            nuclear weapons, in a wide range of yields, into our conventional
                            forces. On the other hand, an increasing dependence on nuclear weapons
                            may impair U.S. ability to intervene against local aggression without
                            the use of such weapons.</p>

                            Western allies retain a potential for further substantial increases in

                            aggression extremely unlikely, and many of them are beginning to believe
                            that trends in military technology render their existing military

                            force levels will thus probably decline to some extent; West German

                            coalition forces will be slow and difficult. The nations of these areas
                            will generally not be able to assume any major share of the financial
                            burden of defense against external attack. However, it may be possible
                            to develop effective internal security forces.</p>

                            and more open solicitation of public support. Emergence of Communist
                            leaders from the underground and increased efforts at infiltration of
                            bona fide political, religious, labor and social groups are taking
                            place. Augmenting this internal threat is the presence of an <pb xml:id="pg_261" n="261" facs="0285"/>estimated 20,000 “hard-core”
                            Communists in countries immediately adjacent to our borders. Collection

                            possible use of diplomatic immunity, low-flying light aircraft, merchant
                            and small vessels, and because of our relatively unguarded coastal and
                            land frontiers and inadequate safeguards at many vital installations and
                            facilities.</p>
                        <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Soviet Political Stability.</hi> Over the next
                            several years at least, it seems unlikely that the nature of the Soviet
                            political system will significantly change or the stability of the
                            regime be seriously weakened. Despite the continued existence of major
                            problems, such as those in agriculture and possible future requirements
                            of increases in consumer goods, there seems little likelihood of any
                            early development of internal pressures so great as to compel a basic
                            alteration of Soviet policies. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            almost certainly will not abandon its hold over the satellites, nor is
                            it likely that any upsurge of satellite nationalism will seriously shake
                            this hold. A prolonged reduction of tensions would accelerate the
                            already evident decline of popular hope for liberation and hasten the
                            process of adjustment to Communist control in the satellites. However,
                            such a reduction might also eventually tend to alter the nature of
                            Communist control over the satellites, although such a change would not
                            necessarily reduce the effectiveness of such control. An extended period
                            of reduced international tensions and wider East-West contacts would
                            present problems for the Bloc as well as the West. The relaxation of
                            harsh police controls may be difficult to reverse, and the promise of
                            higher standards of living may be difficult to abandon. If a change in
                            Soviet foreign policy required reversion to a policy of sacrifices
                            enforced by drastic controls, internal discontent would result, although
                            it could almost certainly be kept in check. A relaxation of domestic
                            controls and of the atmosphere of hostility in East-West relations
                            could, if continued over the much longer run, combine with other factors
                            ultimately to create pressures for change within the Bloc, provided the
                            free world prevents Communist victories.</p>
                        <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Communist China.</hi> Although Communist China
                            faces internal problems much greater than those of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, its control over the people is
                            becoming increasingly firm. Meanwhile, Communist China’s prestige and
                            influence within and outside the Bloc are growing, and the Soviet regime
                            will remain careful to treat it as a partner. Latent conflicts of
                            interest between the two powers may eventually develop, but the tie
                            between the two regimes will probably remain strong at <pb xml:id="pg_262" n="262" facs="0286"/>least for some years to come,
                            not only for ideological reasons but also because it furthers the
                            purposes of both nations, and because of the existence of common
                            enemies.</p>

                            decade 1951–1960 Soviet industrial production will have grown from
                            roughly one-fifth to approximately two-fifths that of the United States.
                            However, the absolute margin of the U.S. <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> over that of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            will be larger at the end of the period than at the beginning. The
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will certainly continue to
                            devote a much higher proportion of its resources to investment and
                            probably a somewhat larger share to military use than will the United
                            States. The United States, and to a lesser degree the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, have the economic capability if
                            necessary to increase their current military efforts. Because of the
                            increasing importance of forces-in-being in an age of nuclear weapons,
                            economic and industrial potential for production after war begins is
                            becoming a less dependable measure of the ability to achieve victory in
                            general nuclear war than in past years. However, economic and industrial
                            potential will continue to be a critical factor in cold war.</p>
                        <p>13. <hi rend="italic">U.S. and Soviet Technological Capacity and
                                Potential.</hi> The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has been
                            systematically building at an accelerating rate a research and
                            development complex of great effectiveness. It has committed manpower
                            and monetary resources to this complex on a scale that has enabled it to
                            rise from a position of marked inferiority and dangerously to challenge
                            the supremacy of Western technology. The Communist technological threat
                            is an immediate and formidable one in that advanced weapons that appear
                            to match many of the best U.S. weapons are now becoming operational; it
                            is a continuing one in that the Soviets have made remarkable
                            technological progress in the last ten years and are now expanding their
                            scientific and technological resources more rapidly than the United
                            States. Additionally, the Soviets have developed remarkably speedy and
                            efficient procedures for translating research into line production of
                            excellent weapons. The possibility of their surprising the United States
                            with new weapons that will be hard to counter cannot be discounted.
                            Technological superiority rests heavily on the ingenuity and organizing
                            ability of a relatively small body of scientific and engineering talent.
                            The Soviets already equal or surpass U.S. output of scientists and
                            engineers and, more importantly, they surpass the United States in
                            producing teachers of science and engineering, in providing primary and
                            secondary school instruction in these fields, and in inducing talented
                            students to become scientists and engineers. Although they do not yet
                            equal, they are approaching the United States in absolute numbers of
                            scientists and engineers, and are concentrating very effectively their
                            existing scientific engineering and production talent on the problem of
                            military technology. The scientific potential of the U.S. allies can
                            make a major <pb xml:id="pg_263" n="263" facs="0287"/>contribution to
                            the technological capabilities of the free world, and if better utilized
                            can do much to meet the Communist technological challenge.</p>

                            activity are maintained:</p>
                        <p>a. In Western Europe, the outlook is for continued growth, despite
                            inflationary pressures in some countries and the UK balance of payments
                            difficulties.</p>
                        <p>b. Despite improvements in its balance of payments position in the past
                            year, Japan will face a long-run problem of supporting its growing
                            population with its limited resources and dependence on external trade,
                            especially as U.S. dollar expenditures decline. In order to avoid
                            excessive dependence on trade with the Bloc, Japan must maintain
                            expanding markets with the rest of the world.</p>

                            widely; continued rather high rates of economic growth may be expected
                            in certain parts of Latin America, while some countries, particularly in
                            Asia and Africa, are apt to lag. There is grave danger that the
                            economies of certain countries with large agricultural surpluses will be
                            increasingly oriented toward the Bloc.</p>

                                Areas.</hi> Soviet economic progress, in spite of the fact that
                            Soviet living standards are low compared to those of the United States,
                            will be an impressive example for many peoples with even lower living
                            standards, arid could constitute an important element in spreading
                            Soviet influence, especially in Asia. Communist China’s
                            industrialization is expected to continue at a relatively rapid rate, as
                            compared with that of other Asian countries, and will also exert
                            considerable attractive force on Asian peoples if economic improvement
                            in free Asia is slow or non-existent. The speed of industrialization and
                            of improvement in living standards achieved respectively in India and in
                            Communist China may come to be regarded in some Asian countries as a
                            test of whether totalitarian or non-totalitarian methods are best suited
                            for pursuing their own economic growth. Western failure to respond
                            effectively to the needs of underdeveloped countries for outside aid in
                            their development would, in some cases, also make them increasingly
                            receptive to offers of Bloc aid. Although the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Communist China are economically inferior to the
                            United States and the West, their ability to absorb large amounts of
                            goods in barter from under-developed countries has enabled them to make
                            political gains by economic measures in this area.</p>

                            of U.S. alliances can probably be maintained but might become less
                            effective. There is a growing unwillingness to submerge conflicting
                            national interests and ambitions in the face of a reduced sense of
                            common danger; prospects <pb xml:id="pg_264" n="264" facs="0288"/>for
                            significantly more cohesive political groupings have diminished. Since
                            most U.S. allies contemplate the prospective consequences of nuclear war
                            with growing dread, they will be increasingly reluctant to participate
                            in actions which appear to them to involve appreciable risks of war.
                            Thus prospects for maintaining the effectiveness of free world alliances
                            will diminish unless the United States convinces its allies of the
                            mutual benefit of collective effort and collective defense as a
                            deterrent. It seems unlikely, however, that even the advent of nuclear
                            plenty would lead most U.S. allies, especially the major ones, to
                            abandon their alliances with the United States, particularly since they
                            recognize the vital importance of being under the umbrella of U.S.
                            deterrent power. However, in the event of a major crisis involving, in
                            their view, imminent danger of nuclear war, the internal strains which
                            most U.S. allies would experience would make their behavior uncertain
                            and unpredictable.</p>

                            countries will continue to be a major source of weakness in the position
                            of the free world, owing to such factors as political instability,
                            economic backwardness, and extreme nationalism. The dangers of
                            subversion will be great, especially in countries under the shadow of
                            Communist power and subject to direct Communist pressures and
                            intervention. In Southeast Asia the present situation remains precarious
                            despite progress in Vietnam. Even in countries not immediately under
                            Communist military pressures, e.g., India and Pakistan, dominant
                            moderate forces will eventually lose ground if they cannot offer hope of
                            more rapid and substantial material progress than has hitherto been
                            achieved. Failure of the free world to deal more effectively with the
                            problems of less developed areas will thus weaken the free world and
                            benefit international Communism, even in countries where actual
                            Communist takeover is not imminent.</p>

                            Nationalist sentiment is spreading rapidly; colonies and dependent
                            regions not yet heavily affected will become so within a comparatively
                            short period. Increasing conflicts between nationalist movements and
                            colonial powers and between natives and European settlers are thus
                            likely. These conflicts will be difficult to compromise on any lasting
                            basis, and will probably involve spreading violence and a progressive
                            weakening of remaining European rule in Asia and Africa. They will
                            present possibilities for divisions and disputes within the free world,
                            will diminish the usefulness of Western bases, and may offer
                            opportunities for Communist exploitation.</p>

                            and may serve as the focus for a loosely coordinated group of nations.
                            In these uncommitted nations, there will be a continuing contest for
                            influence between the Communist Bloc and the United States and its

                            comparably significant effect.</p>

                            Intentions and Strategy</p>
                        <p>20. <hi rend="italic">Soviet External Objectives.</hi> The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has not modified its basic hostility
                            toward the non-Communist world, and especially toward the United States
                            as the power center of that world, or its long-range aim of achieving a
                            Soviet Communist-dominated world and its belief in the ultimate triumph
                            of Communism. The Soviet leaders can be expected to seek constantly, by
                            every means they find advantageous, to extend Communist power and to
                            weaken those forces, especially U.S. power and influence, which they
                            regard as inexorable enemies of their system. However, they will almost
                            certainly avoid pursuing their long-term goals in ways which jeopardize
                            the security of the regime or their control of the Communist Bloc.
                            Soviet objectives can be listed as follows:</p>
                        <p>a. The security of the regime and of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>b. Maintaining the Soviet hold on the European satellites, and keeping
                            China within the Communist Bloc.</p>
                        <p>c. Elimination of U.S. influence and bases from Eurasia, neutralization
                            of U.S. allies, and isolation of the United States.</p>
                        <p>d. Expansion of Soviet Communist power throughout Eurasia.</p>
                        <p>e. Elimination of the United States as a competing power center.</p>
                        <p>f. The spread of Communism throughout the world.</p>
                        <p>These Soviet objectives are unchanged. However, some Soviet diplomatic
                            successes, increased striking power, and increased confidence that the
                            United States excludes general war as a means of <pb xml:id="pg_266" n="266" facs="0290"/>settling international disputes, have probably
                            given the Soviet leaders more confidence in the security of their regime
                            and the solidity of the Sino-Soviet Bloc.</p>
                        <p>21. <hi rend="italic">Chinese Communist External Objectives and
                                Policy.</hi> Communist China’s external objectives are (a) the
                            security of the regime, which the Chinese Communists consider impaired
                            by the continued existence of a U.S. supported Nationalist Government on
                            Taiwan; (b) the expansion of Chinese Communist power to the point where
                            Communist China is the dominant power in Asia and U.S. influence is
                            excluded from the Far East. Communist China’s pursuit of these
                            objectives will be generally coordinated with the Soviet Union, but will
                            reflect a difference of emphasis arising from its regional interests.
                            Communist China will continue to pursue policies emphasizing political
                            rather than military action as long as its objectives are acceptably
                            served by this means. The Chinese Communists probably do not intend to
                            attack Taiwan so long as the U.S. maintains its commitments to the
                            Nationalists, but they may expect to induce a gradual erosion of the
                            Nationalist position. Communist China will use the threat of force and
                            continue to build up its armed forces in the Taiwan area; it may employ
                            its armed forces against some of the off-shore islands at any time. If
                            it avoids the use of force, Communist China will seek such potential
                            advantages as a greater likelihood of relaxation of East-West trade
                            controls and of achieving UN membership.</p>
                        <p>22. <hi rend="italic">Prospects of Communist Aggression.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>a. Provided that the United States and the free world have at all times
                            an adequate military posture and the necessary determination, it appears
                            unlikely that, within the next several years, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or Communist China will deliberately
                            initiate general war, or engage in overt military aggression which in
                            their judgment would involve appreciable risk of large-scale hostilities
                            with the United States. They will try to avoid courses of action which
                            they believe would clearly involve such risk. However, they may come to
                            estimate that offensive action limited to the off-shore islands would
                            not involve them in large-scale hostilities with the United States.
                            Further possibilities of Communist aggression are present in Indochina,
                            e.g., renewed fighting in Laos or a Communist attack or large-scale
                            insurrection against South Vietnam if the 1956 elections do not take
                            place. Even where Communist use of force is estimated as unlikely, the
                            threat of force greatly assists Communist subversion in peripheral area.
                            The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Communist China would,
                            furthermore, probably not be deterred by the risk of general war from
                            taking military counteraction against Western actions considered by them
                            to be an imminent threat to the security of their regimes.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_267" n="267" facs="0291"/>
                        <p>b. Attainment of the capability to inflict crippling damage on the United
                            States may cause the Communist powers to increase the pace of their
                            attempts at progressive local expansion, supported by force or threat of
                            force. They will do this, however, only if they judge that their action
                            could succeed and would not provoke a U.S. or allied counteraction
                            involving appreciable risk of general war. Such increased attempts at
                            local expansion will, therefore, depend in large measure on the Bloc’s
                            estimate of free world will and deterrent strength. An important element
                            in this estimate would be the degree to which the Communist powers had
                            in the meantime isolated the United States from its allies or made gains
                            elsewhere in the free world.</p>
                        <p>23. <hi rend="italic">Current Soviet Policy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>a. While these Soviet objectives stated above will remain unchanged, the
                            flexibility with which they are being pursued is increasing markedly. In
                            1955 Communist tactics against the free nations shifted in emphasis from
                            reliance on violence and the threat of violence to reliance on division,
                            enticement and duplicity. While the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> apparently desires a less tense relationship with the
                            Western powers, it seems clear that it will not, in order to achieve
                            this, concede territories now under its control, notably East Germany,
                            or make any agreements which would impair the relative Soviet power
                            position. Nor is it likely to forgo any ready opportunities for
                            expanding its influence in other areas, particularly in the Middle East
                            and Africa, by non-military means. The Soviets have made significant
                            gains in technology and in the industrialization of their country and
                            are thus in an increasingly favorable position to foster and develop
                            trade relations with underdeveloped raw resource countries. They are
                            seeking to use to their advantage the greater prestige and acceptance
                            among the family of nations which resulted from the Summit Conference
                            and thus overcome the stigma of Godless barbarism which they have borne
                            in varying degree ever since the Russian revolution. While depicting the
                            United States as preoccupied with military alliances and preparations,
                            the Soviets are devoting more attention and resources than before to the
                            elimination, by diplomatic and economic means, of U.S. influence,
                            alliances, and bases in Asia and Africa.</p>
                        <p>b. The Communist powers will maintain, and even increase, efforts to
                            weaken and disrupt free world strength and unity and to expand the area
                            of Communist influence or control. Particularly if the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> succeeds in improving its reputation
                            for peaceful intentions, such efforts will present the united States
                            with a serious threat difficult to deal with because less likely to
                            manifest itself through readily identifiable crises, but more likely to
                            lead to gradual erosion of free world positions. Specifically, the
                            Soviets will play upon changing European attitudes toward <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, seeking to undermine confidence in
                            the United States and to bring about an eventual withdrawal of U.S. <pb xml:id="pg_268" n="268" facs="0292"/>forces from Europe, and will
                            seek to pursue “popular front” tactics in such countries as France and
                            Italy. In the Middle and Far East, the Communists will step up their
                            campaign against Western efforts to build up defensive strength and
                            alliances, exploiting nationalist and anti-colonialist sentiments,
                            encouraging divisive conflicts, and employing further offers of trade
                            and of economic and military assistance. Their aims will be to promote
                            neutralism, undermine and replace Western influence, and create
                            subversive assets. They may be expected to exploit the horror of nuclear
                            warfare resulting from <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and U.S.
                            capabilities as suits their political purposes. In very vulnerable areas
                            the Communists may employ more aggressive subversive tactics where it
                            will serve their purposes to seize power or disrupt the local
                            government.</p>
                        <p>24. <hi rend="italic">Free World Reaction.</hi> Wherever an ostensibly
                            “soft” Bloc line is dominant, our allies will be prone to explore it
                            seriously, and some will probably, in seeking a basis of “coexistence”,
                            tend toward trusting accommodation. Even if the Bloc offers no real
                            concession, this tendency will probably persist, supported by large
                            segments of public opinion. The unity and resolution of the free world
                            coalition will, therefore, be substantially affected by the U.S. ability
                            (a) to convince its allies that the United States is making serious
                            efforts to resolve outstanding issues by agreements compatible with free
                            world security, and (b) meanwhile to maintain its strength while the
                            threat persists.</p>

                            that he wished at the end of the meeting to raise another matter on
                            which he wanted to have the views of the National Security Council. The
                            President hesitated for a moment, and then said that the matter in
                            question was to hear from the Secretary of Defense whether <pb xml:id="pg_269" n="269" facs="0293"/>the latter was doing as good a

                            added that he had put this question to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> in a memorandum.<note n="2" xml:id="d67fn2">In this memorandum, dated March 20, <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> requested a report on

                            received the President’s memorandum but, of course, had not had time to
                            make a full investigation. He could point out at this time, however,
                            that unlike the Army and the Navy, whose positions were relatively
                            stabilized, the Air Force was still building up to its agreed levels of
                            forces and equipment. He proposed to get his people together promptly to
                            see where we were now at, but added that he would like to say now that
                            he was “in some trouble”. It was proving to be very difficult to keep
                            the current expenditure rate in the Defense Department for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956 down to the levels which had been
                            estimated earlier. He believed that the total expenditures of the
                            Defense Department as a whole would actually prove to be higher than the
                            earlier forecast.</p>
                        <p>As for the probable expenditures for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1957, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that
                            he had likewise made the best forecast he could at the earlier time. It
                            had proved necessary, however, to crank some of the things eliminated
                            back into the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957 budget. They were
                            spending a very great deal on research and development, for which there
                            was a continuing demand for funds. We were also getting into the stage
                            now of replacing and modernizing our equipment, and this was a very
                            expensive operation. As best he could now foresee, the prospect for the
                            years 1958, 1959 and 1960 was one of increasing Defense Department
                            expenditures. These increases were not the result of extravagance, but
                            were based on the realities which we faced. Accordingly, said Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, he feared he had a
                            rather poor report to make on this <pb xml:id="pg_270" n="270" facs="0294"/>whole matter. It should not be forgotten, however, that
                            the problem ultimately gets back to the basic matter of U.S. commitments
                            and U.S. troop deployments. Unless such commitments and deployments were
                            changed, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said,
                            he found it hard to criticize the military requirements for carrying out
                            these commitments which were given to him by his military people.</p>
                        <p>The question of whether or not the United States was keeping ahead of the
                            Soviets in the production of jet bombers, guided missiles, and
                            supersonic fighters was another matter. There was a real possibility
                            that the Soviet production of supersonic fighters might make our own
                            B–36 aircraft obsolete. At any rate, this was the opinion of many Air
                            Force people, and a review of the matter was now in progress in the
                            Defense Department. In general, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> felt that we might actually slip behind the
                            Russians if we do not exert ourselves more in this area of the
                            supersonic fighters, etc.</p>
                        <p>The President observed that if the gist of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s report was accurate, we
                            appeared to have spent a great deal of money to no very good
                            purpose.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> pointed out that
                            the B–36 was, after all, a very old problem, in the early stages of
                            which Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> himself
                            had been involved. The President inquired the precise number of B–36’s
                            which were now in operation. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> replied that 330 of these aircraft were now in
                            operation.</p>
                        <p>After pointing out that the Defense Department was now gearing itself to
                            face Senator Symington’s<note n="4" xml:id="d67fn4">Stuart Symington
                                (D–Mo.).</note> investigation of the capabilities of the Air Force,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that the
                            big question now facing him in the Defense Department was a complete
                            review of all our existing intelligence material with respect to the
                            Soviet missile program and to the production of Soviet jet bombers and
                            supersonic fighter aircraft. Vis-à-vis the Soviet effort, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that he opposed
                            the view that we should simply sit where we are. We should speed up,
                            should increase both our production of B–52’s and our production of new
                            fighter aircraft. Otherwise we could not honestly go before the people
                            of the United States and honestly tell them that we were staying ahead
                            of the Russians. Again, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, this report wasn’t very cheerful. He would like,
                            if the President agreed, to provide him with “an up-to-date look at the
                            whole business”, starting with the basic intelligence material.</p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_HRR1">Hughes</persName> said he wished all
                            the members of the Council to realize that the Bureau of the Budget had
                            not dictated to the Department of Defense the expenditure figures which
                            were now being discussed. The level of expenditures had been devised by
                            the Department of Defense with some help from the Bureau of the Budget.
                            They had <pb xml:id="pg_271" n="271" facs="0295"/>figured on a $34.5
                            billion expenditure level for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956 and
                            for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957. All this indicated that we
                            had reached a vital crossroads. The problem which now faced us was
                            whether or not we proposed to adhere to our total budget program as it
                            had originally been formulated.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that this whole matter worried him. After all,
                            the Joint Chiefs of Staff are the jury who must decide our military
                            requirements. He had nearly fainted when General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>, able as he was, had suggested
                            to him that the size of the Army should now be increased to 28 divisions
                            in view of our worldwide commitments. 28 divisions, in the President’s
                            opinion, was far too large a number in the light of the kind of future
                            war we may be called upon to fight. In reply, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> undertook to defend General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s figure by reference
                            to existing U.S. commitments. He repeated that unless these commitments
                            were changed he could not escape the terrible pressure which came from
                            all his military people. Except from Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>, he got no help from his
                            military advisers in trying to turn expenditures in a downward
                            direction.</p>
                        <p>The President stressed the responsibility of the heads of each department
                            for expenditures. He added that the great question to be faced was what
                            our minimum commitments should be in terms of our national security.
                            Referring to the U.S. divisions in Europe, the President pointed out
                            that when these troops were first sent over we had confidently expected
                            to bring some or all of them back to the United States when indigenous
                            European strength had been built up. Now the prospect is that they will
                            stay there indefinitely, because the European nations have not been
                            built up. The security of the United States, said the President, is
                            essentially based on the aircraft and on the capability to deliver the
                            bomb. In other military areas we could certainly reduce expenditures if
                            the three Services would really get together and determine to do so in a
                            spirit of mutual understanding.</p>
                        <p>The President then indicated that the meeting was at an end, but
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> asked to be
                            allowed to say a word. He said that he was not quite prepared at this
                            time to present a complete picture of the nation’s financial situation.
                            This might be ready within a couple of weeks, but he would like at least
                            to sketch the outline at the present time. Our basic trouble, continued
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, was no matter
                            of details, but was instead a matter of fundamentals. It tied into what
                            our foreign policy was and what was contained in the long list of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> policy papers. In his opinion these
                            policy papers were just filled with things that the United States ought
                            to do. These papers reminded Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> of the little boy who went into the candy shop
                            and ordered more candy than he could eat or pay for. Accordingly,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> believed that
                            all these policies should be reviewed. We were, in his opinion, way off
                            base.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_272" n="272" facs="0296"/>
                        <p>Turning then to the subject of the current financial picture, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that our income
                            was increasing a whole lot faster than we had estimated it would. We
                            were now ahead by a billion or two. But our expenses were likewise
                            running ahead of estimates by about the same amount. Accordingly, we
                            could end up the fiscal year by being a billion under or a billion over.
                            The prospects on the whole were still that income would exceed outgo,
                            and that we could get a balanced budget. He was delighted that this was
                            the case, but we actually deserved very little credit for this
                            outcome.</p>
                        <p>Turning from the current picture and looking ahead, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that this was where he
                            perceived real trouble. Many of the reductions in the Defense Department
                            were honest and accurate as of today, but they would be “phonies” for
                            tomorrow, since many of the current reductions were one-shot affairs
                            which would not be repeated in the forthcoming fiscal years. We were
                            making plans all over the world to do a great many things that we were
                            in no position to pay for. The current year was the biggest year in
                            terms of income and Gross National Product in our history, and we are
                            barely going to break even this year. What was going to happen in the
                            future if we actually carry out what was called for in this flock of
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> policy papers?</p>
                        <p>In addition to the money we are spending for national security at home,
                            said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, we are
                            spending money all over the world, particularly as a result of our
                            military and economic assistance programs and the support of our troops
                            overseas. The result had been a terrific drain on our gold. Indeed, we
                            had lost almost as much gold in the three years of the present
                            Administration as we had lost in the years of the Truman Administration.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> illustrated
                            this point by citing figures on the drain of U.S. gold. In conclusion,
                            he said he had one thing to point out, namely, that our programs were
                            bigger than our pocketbook. We have got to make a basic review of our
                            troop deployments and we have got to change our national security
                            policies. We must not be borne down by a lot of poor weak allies. In
                            reviewing our security programs we must make the decision as to exactly
                            the kind of program we want. If it turns out that such a program will
                            cost more than we have resources to pay for, we must go to the Congress
                            and ask for increased taxes.</p>
                        <p>In reply to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> commented first
                            on the manner in which the Department of Defense had contributed to the
                            loss of gold which had been discussed by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> remarked thereafter that he
                            wished he could say that he saw some way of carrying out our present
                            defense programs and at the same time saving a billion or two instead of
                            adding a billion or two of additional expenditures. He did not, however,
                            see how we could do this and still stay ahead of the Russians.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_273" n="273" facs="0297"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that if
                            this proved to be the case, we must either revise our entire national
                            security program or else go to the Congress and ask for additional
                            taxes. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>
                            expressed great dissatisfaction about the present deployment of U.S.
                            forces overseas. He pointed out that we had actually failed to live up
                            to the new-look strategy which the Administration had agreed upon
                            shortly after the new Administration had taken office. Our main defense
                            was supposed to rest on a striking force maintained in the United States
                            and ready to be used anywhere. Actually, however, we had never carried
                            out this new-look strategy.</p>
                        <p>The President pointed out that when all was said and done, we must defend
                            the United States. The real question, he repeated, is what the long-term
                            interests of the United States require abroad. He was sure that if we
                            took our forces out of Europe today we would lose that continent. It was
                            chiefly to Europe that our money was going. On the contrary, we might be
                            able to reduce our forces in Japan.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> then informed the
                            Council that in the last ten days or two weeks he had visited all the
                            various locations where our extensive guided missile programs were being
                            implemented. As a result of directives, some from the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> itself, all these missile programs were
                            being stepped up. Test schedules were being devised. It was the
                            consensus everywhere that this schedule of programs and tests would be
                            met. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> said he was
                            impressed with progress on these programs and appalled by the
                            potentialities of these missiles. He added that of course these programs
                            were tremendously expensive, even though they were still in the research
                            stage. In six months’ time, moreover, we would be shifting from the
                            research stage, and the Defense Department would be involved in shaping
                            up a procurement program for these missiles, the training of men to
                            operate them, and the provision of launching sites.</p>
                        <p>The President suggested that since there were several programs designed
                            to produce long-range or shorter-range missiles, the exercise of
                            selectivity would ultimately permit us to concentrate on the best
                            long-range missile and the best short-range missile after the tests have
                            been completed. This could result in some savings. While Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> agreed in the main
                            with the President, he pointed out that in addition to the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> and other surface-to-surface missiles, there was a
                            whole family of other types of missiles.</p>
                        <p>The President then speculated as to whether, after we had achieved our
                            objective of an intercontinental missile, we could cut down our
                            production of intercontinental bomber aircraft. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> was inclined to doubt whether
                            missiles could ever wholly replace manned aircraft. The latter, for
                            example, were essential, to search out targets in enemy territory. He
                            could not, at any rate, quickly see us going over wholly to reliance on
                            intercontinental missiles, and <pb xml:id="pg_274" n="274" facs="0298"/>in any event, we were being obliged to commit a vast sum of money to
                            carrying on our missile programs. The President said he agreed in the
                            main with Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>, but
                            felt that the achievement of intercontinental missiles would permit us
                            some reduction in the production of manned aircraft. Must we forever
                            keep on producing B–52’s? Why do we never seem to get any alternatives
                            or substitutes?</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> replied that part
                            of the answer to the President’s dilemma would be provided by certainty
                            as to the use of nuclear weapons in any future war. If the situation as
                            to the use of such weapons remains fuzzy, the expense of maintaining the
                            production of conventional weapons will continue to be saddled upon
                                us.<note n="5" xml:id="d67fn5">On March 23, <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> addressed the National War
                                College and Industrial College of the Armed Forces in Washington.
                                During his speech, <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>
                                listed seven “Key Factors in Future Military Planning,” one of which
                                was the use of atomic weapons. <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> noted that “our present military force
                                structures and our war plans provide for the use of atomic weapons
                                when it is to our military advantage. They are based on present
                                national policy of integrating nuclear weapons with other weapons in
                                our military arsenal.” A copy of <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>’s address is in the Eisenhower Library,

                        </p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> repeated his
                            view that our main trouble was caused by the fact that we had more
                            commitments than we could carry out. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> agreed that at any rate we had a
                            couple of “big losers” in Korea and Formosa. We were providing over $700
                            million to Korea each year. Could not these commitments be reduced?
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> replied that if
                            we shut off Korea we might just as well quit our whole position in the
                            Far East. In his opinion, neither Korea nor Formosa was a loser, and he
                            felt obliged to disagree with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> on this issue. In his opinion Korea and Formosa
                            were actually doing a job for the United States.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that he had
                            never meant to suggest that the United States pull out of Korea and
                            Formosa altogether. He did believe that we might be able to cut down our
                            commitments in these areas. The President commented that we could
                            probably do something along this line when we got rid of old Rhee.<note n="6" xml:id="d67fn6">Syngman Rhee, President of the Republic of

                            1956.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Baruch has written me or otherwise sent me messages several times
                            concerning the need for greater progress in the guided missile
                                field.<note n="2" xml:id="d68fn2">See <ref target="#d55">Document
                                    55</ref>.</note> Because he has, in two great wars, been deeply
                            involved in America’s logistic efforts, his opinions are certainly worth
                            considering—if for no other reason than because of his standing and
                            reputation in the public mind. In any event, I have explained to him the
                            world situation as I see it, with special reference to the relative
                            capabilities of the Soviets and ourselves in our capacity for inflicting
                            destruction upon the other.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out that if our calculations are anywhere near correct, there
                            is no question that in a matter of hours we could inflict very great,
                            even decisive, damage upon the productive power of the Soviet Union and
                            its satellites. The guided missile is therefore merely another, or
                            auxiliary, method of delivering over the Soviet Union the kind of
                            destructive force that is represented in the hydrogen bomb. Until we
                            found the way to make a bomb of megaton size and put it in a small
                            package, capable of being transported by ballistic methods, the
                            ballistic missile was not even a serious threat.</p>
                        <p>I further pointed out that the ballistic missile and its early production
                            will have greater effect on world psychological reaction because people
                            see it as the “ultimate” weapon, and have a picture of guided missiles
                            raining out of the skies in almost uncounted numbers; it is extremely
                            important that the Soviets do not get ahead of us in the general
                            organization of our atomic bomb effort, and the money we are devoting to
                            it. In[<hi rend="italic">On</hi>] this last point, I tried to show him
                            that we are already employing so many of the nation’s scientists and
                            research facilities that even the expenditure of a vastly greater amount
                            could scarcely produce any additional results.</p>
                        <p>I also explained to him that I had decided not to make a “Manhattan
                            Project” out of the research effort. Slow and varied type of development
                            has been going on in this field, for some years, and the operating
                            people who know most about the matter are in the services. Moreover,
                            each of the services has in its direct employ, or through contract with
                            large firms, the only scientists who have been constantly engaged in
                            this work. This means that the matter must be kept in the hands of the
                            services, but I do agree with Mr. Baruch that the civilian boss of the
                            job should be a real boss and not a mere expediter.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_276" n="276" facs="0300"/>
                        <p>The conversation then turned to trade. Since in the past he had spoken to
                            me rather feelingly about the wickedness of any of our so-called friends
                            who deal with the Communists, I was quite astonished to find that he now
                            really favors a general plan of removing all restrictions on all trade
                            with the Reds. This conforms to my view, except that we know that there
                            are a few of our types of machinery that the Soviets want as patterns
                            and models. These I would keep on the prohibited list. Otherwise,
                            however, I believe that the effort to dam up permanently the natural
                            currents of trade, particularly between such areas as Japan and the
                            neighboring Asian mainland, will be defeated.</p>

                            <item>Memorandum prepared by Defense, in response to request from the
                                President, concerning 1957–58 Defense budget picture<note n="2" xml:id="d69fn2">Reference is presumably to the memorandum from
                                    the President to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, March 20; see <ref target="#d67fn2">footnote 2, Document 67</ref>.</note>
                            </item>
                        </list>
                        <p>President first read memorandum and accompanying charts, asked question
                            about relocation warning line (explained by <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName>).</p>
                        <p>The President said that whole effort represented a fine recommendation,
                            but where was he to get the money since we are up to the limit of our
                            indebtedness.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_277" n="277" facs="0301"/>
                        <p>The Director of the Bureau of the Budget interposed that the Bureau of
                            the Budget had not been asked to concur in the recommendations under
                            discussion.</p>
                        <p>The President questioned the figure set forward for the support of the
                            Reserve force, saying that he did not think we had any substantial
                            Reserve force. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName>
                            indicated the Reserve force was being increased, and that the requested
                            appropriation is consistent with the increased program. The President
                            said in an offside that he thought all the ingenuity had been lost (by
                            the regular Armed forces) in scraping up people to do miscellaneous
                            jobs.</p>
                        <p>The President asked specifically about the change in plans for ship
                            construction. <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> explained
                            that six ships in the ’56 program had been originally planned—three to
                            carry guided missiles and three with more conventional batteries.
                            However, the guided missiles to be put on such ships have progressed to
                            the point where all six ships can be so outfitted, indeed the missiles
                            are ready now, and it would be cheaper to install them at the
                            construction time rather than to refit them later. The President queried
                            what was so much more expensive about installation of guided missiles on
                            ships (in place of the conventional batteries) and <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> explained that a different and
                            more costly fire control system was needed. It was pointed out that
                            these missiles have nothing to do with ballistic missiles. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> said that the tests on these
                            “Talos” missiles have been encouraging.</p>
                        <p>The President said it looked to him as though first priority had been
                            given to guided missiles. He asked if any program had been cut;
                                <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> said that it had;
                            that Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> was
                            complaining about what had been done to sonar research. Later in the
                            discussion, the President again brought up his feeling that nothing had
                            been cut down, that everything had been expanded. McNeil and <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> assured him that some
                            programs had been reduced, but that the figures did not show on the
                            memorandum presented. The President commented that for his peace of mind
                            it might be better to show where such savings had been made.</p>
                        <p>At one point in the discussion of the guided missiles program and cost,
                                <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> brought out the
                            tremendous costs involved in the “range” that is being developed to test
                            them.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> said that he had
                            discussed the question of the B–52’s with LeMay, and whether the B–52’s
                            meant that the overseas bases would not be so necessary. LeMay will go
                            along about not spending any more on African bases, but hopes that
                            Spanish bases will be kept up. LeMay feels that we could take another
                            look at the “Snark” missile, but doesn’t want to give up on the
                            Navaho.</p>
                        <p>The question of duplication of research and of efforts bothers the
                            President. He again referred back to the fact that nothing is ever
                            eliminated from the requests saying that he thought he had gotten <pb xml:id="pg_278" n="278" facs="0302"/>together the best possible
                            group of officers, and he had yet to hear of anyone who would say he
                            wanted to concede anything; he said he was discouraged to see that no
                            one ever comes up to him to say “let’s get rid of something.” He
                            realizes this is an old story—that it took the Army 50 years to get rid
                            of horses after they had become obsolete. The President said he thought
                            we were building up a very fine case for the people who say “we need
                            more stuff.” Where do we get the money? You can’t raise taxes and expect
                            people to invest their money, and investments are basis of American
                            prosperity.</p>
                        <p>The President referred to the fact that some months ago he had issued
                            orders that the three Services should not air, in the press, their
                            fights and their advances in missile program, and he referred to the
                            clippings Colonel <persName corresp="#p_GCAJ1">Goodpaster</persName> had
                            given him earlier in the afternoon. He said we want to spend more money,
                            and we want to tell everybody exactly what we are doing. He read to the
                            people the story about the Nike location, a statement by Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_BWM1">Brucker</persName> about “another kind
                            of system,” and showed the photograph of an advanced type missile.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> said that
                                <persName corresp="#p_BWM1">Brucker</persName> “should not have said
                            what he did.”</p>
                        <p>The President thought the recent publicity stories were disgraceful, and
                            blamed the public relations departments of the three Services. Then he
                            said he did not want to be quarrelsome, but he did not know where the
                            money would come from—he mentioned the farm bill and what that would
                            cost. But he said he had tried to get the Services together on some
                            things (during the time when he came back to the Pentagon from the
                            Columbia experience) and that obviously he had not gotten very far.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> injected a brighter note
                            by saying that things were really moving very fast, and said that a
                            great deal of defense appropriations were going into intercontinental
                            defense, that some very firm directives had come from <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> (the President said they had been
                            recommended by the Joint Chiefs), and that a lot of expenditures had
                            come as result of <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> report
                            and the report by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed with Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> that he was not entirely convinced that the
                            guided missiles are the answer to all the problems.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> said that they were
                            getting a lot of new weapons, but at the same time they could not stop
                            the production of the old ones. President interjected that he could not
                            see what possible use the Army could have for jet planes.</p>
                        <p>Again about the guided missile programs. Four are under construction,
                            hope is that one will come through. There are two big programs where the
                            approach is quite different, one might work and one might not. The
                            President questioned why the Army should have a 1500-mile ballistic
                            missile program, since the Army does not have the equipment to see where
                            they are hitting.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_279" n="279" facs="0303"/>
                        <p>At one point the President indicated that in the matter of guided
                            missiles he thought the Air Force ought to be the “boss.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> said that in the
                                <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> we have two ballistic
                            missiles— one or both may or may not work. As far as the <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> goes, they started with the Redstone
                            organization of the Army because it was operating and in momentum. The
                            Navy medium-range missile is being developed at Douglas.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRR1">Hughes</persName> said that the Budget
                            questions were thoroughly gone into in December and certain choices were
                            made, and for some time he felt they were being adhered to. Now
                            apparently there seems to be a complete change of atmosphere.</p>
                        <p>There was some discussion of fighter planes—and the lead time necessary
                            to get certain planes into production. The F–110 will be started in
                            production in 60–61, but the F–125 will not be coming along until
                            62–64.</p>
                        <p>The President would like to see the Defense Department cut down to
                            “spartan basis.” But he admitted that people he had known all his life
                            were asking for more and more. He said, “I say the patriot today is the
                            fellow who can do the job with less money.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> emphasized that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> had gone over in the
                            fall the budget very thoroughly with the people in the Departments, had
                            been tough—to the point that they were afraid they would go before the
                            Congress and not have the individual Services with them. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> was able to get a figure of 700
                            million, and got a firm assurance from the Services that this was a
                            program they could live with. Now when they go to the Congress, with the
                            pressure for ballistic missiles, for B–52’s, and pressure from Symington
                            and Russell committee,<note n="3" xml:id="d69fn3">Senate Armed Services
                                Committee.</note> it is going to be difficult. The President
                            admitted it would be agonizing. These hearings will probably start about
                            the 15th of April. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName>
                            emphasized that they would like to know as soon as possible whether the
                            suggestions would be agreeable.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRR1">Hughes</persName> said that Budget would
                            study the matter and present recommendations to the President, and it
                            was indicated group would get together early next week for further
                            discussion.</p>

                            Services are involved in increasing public disagreement among
                            themselves. Also, the last four or five months, quite a large number of
                            “split” issues have had to be taken up to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>. There are a number of points in
                            the nature of basic questions on which clarification is needed.</p>
                        <p>The first is whether we will use atomic weapons in war. There is still
                            reluctance in some quarters to plan on this basis. In actual fact, we
                            are already largely committed as regards our force structure, and will
                            become increasingly so as time goes on.</p>
                        <p>A second question is that of the roles and missions of the individual
                            Services as applied to guided missiles.</p>
                        <p>A third question is a desire by the Army to have more control over its
                            reconnaissance.</p>
                        <p>A fourth is the increasingly aggressive public relations policy of the
                            Services, particularly the Army, but spreading to the others.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> thought that we
                            face so many great and real difficulties, for example, in the Middle
                            East, that we should avoid these distractions.</p>
                        <p>The President recalled that about a year and one-half ago he had stated
                            some very strong views regarding what he termed “competitive publicity”
                            among the Services. He thought that it was highly harmful to the Nation,
                            and thought that it should be stopped. It is the responsibility of the
                            Service Chiefs to give necessary instructions to public relations
                            officers to accomplish this. It ought to be accepted policy to avoid
                            things that are secret or are likely to give away secrets. Public
                            relations activities, when carried out for the purpose of morale, are
                            understandable, but there should be none of this competitive
                            publicity.</p>
                        <p>Commenting on roles and missions, the President said he tends to look on
                            the 1500- and 5000-mile missiles as being in the same class
                            operationally. He thought it would be most harmful to have public <pb xml:id="pg_281" n="281" facs="0305"/>quarreling over the
                            responsibility for employment of such missiles. He has accepted the
                            recommendation of the scientists that we proceed for the present with
                            the development of four missiles, in order to make sure that all
                            possibilities are explored. He feels that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> should put plenary powers in the
                            hands of one man in the missiles field, and that one man should “do the
                            talking.” He recognizes that there is an extremely difficult problem of
                            coordinating air defense missiles with fighter aircraft.</p>
                        <p>With regard to this question of using atomic weapons, he said that the
                            subject is one which calls for great care in discussion. He was clear in
                            his own mind that in any war with the Soviets we would use them. Also,
                            as soon as air defense atomic weapons are projected, he would certainly
                            use them against any aircraft attacking the United States.</p>
                        <p>The President next discussed the fundamental reasons why needs of our
                            economy must always be considered. It is the nature of our Government
                            that everyone, except for a thin layer at the top, is working, knowingly
                            or unknowingly, to damage our economy—the reason being that they see the
                            need for more and more resources for their own Service or agency, and
                            the valuable results that can be achieved through added effort in their
                            own particular element. Unless there is someone who brings all of these
                            together, the net effect is to create burdens which could sap the
                            strength of our economic system. Similarly, there are great pressures on
                            the military program from every particular element, and the catalytic
                            factor provided by the Press and Congress might make it explode. In
                            working for permanent security, we must give due consideration to the
                            right “take” from the economy—one which will permit the economy to
                            remain viable and strong.</p>
                        <p>The President is not expecting the Chiefs to abandon their basic
                            convictions or conclusions about security needs. He is expecting that
                            activities will be conducted on a spartan basis, and with awareness of
                            the essentiality of a sound economy to true security. He referred to the
                            adverse effects of fluctuations which would result from attempting too
                            much for a short period, and then having to cut back deeply. He stressed
                            the need for each Chief to subordinate his position as a champion of a
                            particular Service to his position as one of the overall national
                            military advisors. He would like to see them seek to be the first to
                            suggest places where the program can be cut—particularly on a basis of
                            one Service giving up a function if another Service would perform
                            it.</p>
                        <p>The President said he must look to the Chiefs to work out ideas on
                            specific problems. People sometimes try to depend too much on the
                            President’s own military background and experience. Conclusions on
                            specific problems should be developed by the Chiefs.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_282" n="282" facs="0306"/>
                        <p>The President referred to a great mistake made by a former President. He
                            took a decision in a matter of military policy and then invited
                            individual Chiefs to debate that decision. On any major question, there
                            is always a multitude of factors which could give the basis for dissent.
                            However, decision is often mandatory, and after it is taken, successful
                            results can be achieved if all then pull together.</p>
                        <p>The President said that whenever a matter is up for consideration he
                            wanted the Chiefs to understand that any of them who wished could always
                            come along with <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName>
                            to see him. In fact, his door is open to them at any time.</p>
                        <p>There was then discussion on a few random points. The President thought
                            that if military needs were of the order of 36-1/2 billion as a “level
                            off” figure, it is possible that could be attained without damage to the
                            economy. He said he had had a visit from Mr. Baruch, who told him that
                            he has changed his views on East-West trade, and would now open up wide
                            for trade to expose how little the Soviets have to offer.<note n="2" xml:id="d70fn2">See <ref target="#d68">Document 68</ref>.</note> The
                            President said that if difficulties were to arise requiring U.S. forces
                            in the Middle East, he would plan to draw troops from Europe, since such
                            commitment would in fact be for the protection of the oil supplies to
                            Western Europe. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Taylor</persName>
                            said troops could be brought in faster from the U.S. The President
                            thought it was not desirable to deploy the central reserve as long as
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is not involved. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Taylor</persName> mentioned a plan to
                            rotate a division from Germany to Libya for annual training.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> mentioned that
                            Air Chief Marshal Dickson<note n="3" xml:id="d70fn3">Sir William
                                Dickson, British Marshal of the Royal Air Force and Chairman of the

                            President said he would be happy to see him.</p>
                        <p>The President then discussed some of his ideas concerning the Middle
                            East—the need of building up Saud, and of developing a “package” which
                            we could take to the British for agreement. The idea would be to balance
                            off actions everywhere except to leave pressure on the area
                            selected—perhaps Egypt. There was discussion of the necessity of joining
                            the Baghdad Pact,<note n="4" xml:id="d70fn4">The Pact of Mutual
                                Cooperation between Turkey and Iraq, signed at Baghdad on February
                                24, 1955, generally known as the Baghdad Pact. For text, see <hi rend="italic">United Nations Treaty Series,</hi> vol. 233, p.

                            connection—and also of the danger that, with such assurance, Israel
                            might take actions which would lead to their being attacked, thus
                            committing the United States.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Taylor</persName>’s meeting with
                            the President, which lasted for about an hour, was devoted chiefly to an
                            outline by the General of his thinking on Army aviation and Army
                            missiles, and to an exchange of views and ideas on these subjects. The
                            meeting was in the nature of an informal discussion, not concerned with
                            specific decisions.</p>
                        <p>The discussion of Army aviation turned on what Army aircraft should
                            do—the President was not immediately interested in the size of the Army
                            program, or number of planes, as such. The President knows the Army has
                            need for aircraft organic to its units in the field to join in carrying
                            out their battle tasks. The type of thing that causes him concern is any
                            indication that the Army is taking over support functions through lack
                            of confidence that the Air Force will provide for their needs. Army
                            planes to his mind should, in general, be as slow and as light as
                            possible, designed for operations generally on the friendly side of the
                            line. This type is safest from hostile fighters. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Taylor</persName> pointed out that under
                            the new concepts that are developing, there will be great intermingling
                            on the battlefield, without clear lines, and the need for
                            target-finding, which will be very acute, raises the need for aircraft
                            that can go in to observe and photograph more deeply. He emphasized that
                            there was no thought of having aircraft which could not take off from
                            small open fields.</p>
                        <p>The President said he had heard something about the Army wanting jets.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Taylor</persName> said this
                            idea is simply for experimental purposes—to see what could be done with
                            them. The President said there is a constant tendency to make aircraft
                            bigger and heavier, and this might take the Army aircraft out of its
                            proper role. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Taylor</persName> said
                                <pb xml:id="pg_284" n="284" facs="0308"/>that weights and numbers
                            are not in his opinion matters for “Key West agreements.” It should be
                            up to the Army to incorporate what they can best use in the performance
                            of their operations. The President said he had never agreed with those
                            who felt that Army combat units had to have their own close support
                            aviation. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Taylor</persName> said
                            there is good reason to feel that close support air operations are
                            fading out of the picture. Missiles will take over this function. They
                            both recalled that, except for dive bombing, close support aviation was
                            limited in what it could contribute.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Taylor</persName> mentioned Army
                            thinking regarding use of small “drones” for reconnaissance of the
                            battle area. The President questioned whether these might not be quite
                            vulnerable to ground fire.</p>
                        <p>The discussion next turned to Army missiles. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Taylor</persName> showed the President a chart indicating
                            the whole “family” of such missiles. He described briefly the present
                            Nike, the Nike B and Nike 2 now under development, and the “Missile
                            Master” for their coordinated employment. The President said that the
                            problem of coordination of missiles (like anti-aircraft artillery) with
                            interceptors is so difficult that it might be necessary, as in the war,
                            to put all under the control of the Air Defense Commander. He said he
                            thought that it would not be practicable to protect all vital areas with
                            missiles, and those, once installed, are immobile. Interceptors will
                            still be necessary. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General
                                Taylor</persName> said that interceptors could fill in the gaps, and
                            that he thought in fact that this would be their greatest role, as
                            bomber aircraft gain in speed and altitude.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Taylor</persName> described the
                            Honest <persName>John</persName> and the Little John rockets to the
                            President, outlining their close support role. He said the Sergeant and
                            the Redstone would be emplaced further to the rear and carefully sited
                            in, and would be capable of close support and tactical interdiction. The
                            President asked what use the Army would have for a 1500-mile missile.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Taylor</persName> said it is
                            being developed by the Army to take advantage of Redstone experience.
                            The Army had no clear proposals for using it at this time, but was
                            simply asking that no decision be taken now freezing the Army out. Some
                            of these could conceivably be placed in North Africa for support in
                            Central Europe. The President referred to this use as flanking fire,
                            indicating he could see some logic in it, although pointing out that he
                            thought front-line people might be rather worried as to its accuracy
                            when it was firing from such a distance. He also referred to the
                            communications problem of bringing fire down when and where needed, from
                            distant launching points.</p>
                        <p>The President said his general philosophy is to oppose a service assuming
                            or duplicating a function simply because of lack of confidence that
                            another would perform it. Rather he thought each service <pb xml:id="pg_285" n="285" facs="0309"/>should insist on the others
                            making good in providing support. If they fail, he would expect the
                            matter to be brought to the Defense Department and to him.</p>

                        <p>The meeting began with the following present: Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, Director <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_GCAJ1">Colonel Goodpaster</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The President said that it had been reported to him that Air Force
                            testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee left the distinct
                            impression that the Navy does not contribute on strategic bombing. Also,
                            in making strength comparisons, ours had been reported as a second-best
                            Air Force because it is smaller than total Soviet air strength. He asked
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> for a
                            comment. <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> said
                            that there are well coordinated plans which incorporate Navy striking
                            power in the total strategic bombing effort. Because of the way
                            questions are asked, the impression has on occasion been left that the
                            air picture is dark, by relating solely our own Air Force strength to
                            Soviet total strength—including their naval air.</p>
                        <p>The President referred to the need to assure that Congressional inquiries
                            heard an over-all presentation by Defense in initiating their work. Then
                            they could bring in critics of the program, but they should wind up with
                            Defense comment again at the end. There was further discussion on the
                            tendency of questioners to engage in the “numbers racket,” creating
                            false impressions of relative military position.<note n="2" xml:id="d72fn2">On April 4, the President met with Senators James H
                                Duff (R–Pa.) and <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Leverett
                                    Saltonstall</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_PMGWB1">General
                                    Persons</persName>. During the meeting <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> spoke on the subject of
                                the relevance of “numbers” to the military position of the United
                                States, as summarized in a memorandum for record by <persName corresp="#p_PMGWB1">Persons</persName>:<p>“He pointed out that
                                    whether or not we had adequate air power should be based on the
                                    adequacy of our deterrent power and not on numbers alone. He
                                    made it clear that determination is necessarily a matter of
                                    judgment and cannot be worked out on a mathematical exact basis
                                    by anyone. He further made clear that if in the judgment of
                                    responsible officials the United States had adequate power to
                                    deter the Soviet from making an attack, he felt that there was
                                    no justification for adding additional aircraft and other
                                    weapons just for the purpose of trying to match in numbers those
                                    of the Soviets.</p>
                                <p>“The President pointed out that in any consideration of the
                                    adequacy of our security, we must take into account the striking
                                    power of our naval aviation as well as the location of our bases
                                    in close range of the Soviets. Furthermore, we have allies and
                                    the aviation of these allies must be taken into consideration in
                                    looking at the overall picture. He feels that there should be a
                                    close correlation between naval air power and the strategic air
                                    force and that he will instruct the Defense Department to insure
                                    this. He noted that in the public discussions of our air power,
                                    there is little or no mention of the tremendous air power which
                                    is in the hands of the Navy.”</p>

                        <p>At this point the following joined the conference: Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName>, Secretary Thomas, Under
                            Secretary Finucane,<note n="3" xml:id="d72fn3">Charles C. Finucane,
                                Under Secretary of the Army.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General Twining</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Admiral Burke</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_PLGRM1">General Pate</persName>. (<persName corresp="#p_PMGWB1">General Persons</persName> had previously joined
                            at the President’s request.)</p>
                        <p>The President opened this phase of the meeting with a full statement on
                            the military budget situation. He said he had taken action on the final
                            paper for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>–57. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> would consult with Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> on one or two
                            items but in general the Defense proposal will be approved. He said his
                            great concern with this proposal had been that it would simply lay the
                            groundwork for a permanently higher program in future years. From
                            Congress he is being informed that inter-service tensions and rivalries
                            are growing—even that they are worse than any time since unification. He
                            doubts this. He thinks he has the best group heading the establishment
                            that there has been at any time since World War II. This being the case,
                            he sees no reason for any such report of tensions. What he wants is
                            corporate opinion. Single service opinions and points of view are not of
                            value to him.</p>
                        <p>Several specific things were mentioned affecting the Navy and Air Force.
                            He was told that in the Air Force presentation, the Navy was assigned a
                            zero rating in terms of its effect in strategic bombing. If this is the
                            case, he wonders what in the world we are building Forrestal-type
                            carriers for. He realizes that once the “Key West” agreements assigned
                            strategic bombing to <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>. But times have
                            changed and the Navy has units of great striking power. <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> has told him that
                            targets have been assigned to each major force; he supposes the Navy
                            concentrates on ports and coastal areas. If this is the case, their
                            contribution cannot be ignored. He challenges any notion that ours is a
                            second-class Air Force as some reports have apparently indicated. This
                            type of comparison gives a wholly false picture. He said that he has
                            discounted these reports of in-fighting and contention among the
                            services. He thinks that unification has made great gains; which should
                            not be ignored.</p>
                        <p>What this means in his mind is that a Chief of Staff of one service
                            should not present just the picture of his own service alone. Each
                            service supplements the other in over-all military strength. Those
                            testifying should not make it look as though each does the job alone. He
                            recognizes that in the early stages of a blitz the Army and Marine <pb xml:id="pg_287" n="287" facs="0311"/>involvement in the atomic
                            exchange may be less than the other services. If the war goes on,
                            however, their contribution will tend to enlarge.</p>
                        <p>The President stated he was certain in his mind that we can stand on our
                            whole program. If we talk in a unified sense, there will be no basis for
                            people getting alarmed. We must, however, talk about the whole thing. He
                            referred to a recent statement by General Spaatz<note n="4" xml:id="d72fn4">General Carl Spaatz, <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> (ret.).</note> to the effect that the side which
                            has the 5000-mile missile first can win the world [<hi rend="italic">war?</hi>]; he thinks someone should talk to General Spaatz and
                            give him a well-rounded and comprehensive picture of just what our
                            strength is. He said Mr. Baruch had been in, very much concerned about
                            the whole missile situation, and that he had left saying that he was
                            satisfied and the whole matter was cleared up in his mind.</p>
                        <p>The President said his approach is to support the Defense establishment
                            as a whole, not the particular services. This present inquiry seems to
                            be concentrating on the services to get each to say they need a little
                            more.</p>
                        <p>The President then went on to comment on the request from Congress to the
                            Air Force as to what they would do with an additional $1.5 billion. He
                            said a full answer to this would have to be that of course an additional
                            sum like this could be used, but one must think of what its provision
                            would do to the country as a whole. He commented that those present
                            should realize that the Secretary of the Treasury is the one who finally
                            persuaded him to approve this proposed supplemental. He was certain that
                            everybody in this Administration is for a strong Defense establishment
                            but it must be for the Defense establishment as a whole. Everyone should
                            watch his tongue very closely to make sure he is not led into statements
                            regarding his own service which have the effect of giving an impression
                            that would not be borne out with regard to the Defense establishment as
                            a whole. He said that it is not a question of looking for votes. So far
                            as he is concerned, if he were not elected this fall it would simply
                            mean that people should feel sorry for somebody else. What he is
                            committed to is a sound program. He wants to keep a sound approach and a
                            sound Administration. Everyone in the Defense establishment should nail
                            his flag to the staff of the United States of America, and think in
                            terms of the whole. He was convinced if people did that the problems
                            would be avoided. He pointed out that he is not saying that anyone has
                            done anything deliberate in weakening the Administration program. He
                            just thinks that we are being used, by people who draw attention away
                            from the whole and concentrate on the dissatisfactions that individual
                            services may have. The President referred to an inquiry which is about
                            to start, and said he felt the Committee should hear the responsible
                            Defense <pb xml:id="pg_288" n="288" facs="0312"/>officials first, then
                            critics, then wind up with Defense again. He repeated that each man
                            testifying must think of what the other services contribute. If he can’t
                            bring himself to do this, he doesn’t belong in the position he holds. He
                            must not allow himself to be led, through techniques playing on
                            inter-service rivalry, to ask for additions for his own service above
                            what is provided for in a combined Defense program which he considers to
                            be adequate. At this point, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> told the President he had had a meeting of the
                            Armed Forces Policy Council two weeks or so ago in which he had pointed
                            out the efforts that would be made to split the group and play off one
                            against another.</p>
                        <p>The President said he had information that, on one occasion at least, a
                            questioner had detailed, more exact figures than <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General Twining</persName> had. He said this
                            could only mean that information is being passed by someone not
                            authorized to do so. If any subordinates were doing this, they should be
                            found and severely disciplined. <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General
                                Twining</persName> thought the information may be passed by
                            industry. The President said that all should be put on notice that any
                            such conduct of trying to influence administrative decision to get more
                            orders (as Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>
                            suggested) would have just the opposite effect.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Thomas pointed out that all three of the service Secretaries
                            have served in the Department of Defense. All are “on the team.” He
                            pledged his full loyalty to the President and his program. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> repeated that he is
                            trying to build up a team spirit. The President said the problem is that
                            certain individuals are trying to split the group. He advised, when
                            questions are asked, not simply to answer them in narrow terms and in
                            the specific detail requested, but always to try to see that the
                            perspective is given. We should understand that the questioner
                            oftentimes is trying to create an impression through the incompleteness
                            of the discussion, and therefore an attempt should be made to round it
                            out. The President said that this supplemental will be before the
                            Congress before individuals go down to appear in the new inquiry.
                            Everybody should stand on that. <persName corresp="#p_PMGWB1">General
                                Persons</persName> advised all to be very careful of the “numbers
                            racket”—to round out the explanation, for example to bring out that the
                            problem is one of over-all deterrent power rather than matching item for
                            item. The President said that when we have “enough” as was brought out
                            in the evaluation report, comparisons of item by item are not too
                            meaningful.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that the
                            approval of this supplemental “fills the hand” of Defense. He will be
                            very disappointed if all top people do not battle it out on this
                            basis.</p>
                        <p>The President said we must put our costs on a basis that we can sustain
                            indefinitely. If they are allowed to run too high, the result would be
                            to ruin the America we know and force us into a garrison <pb xml:id="pg_289" n="289" facs="0313"/>state. He said that people
                            should not be misled by enticements for more funds. The same man
                            offering them is saying that he could cut the budget $8 billion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> asked for it to be
                            made clear that if this supplemental is given, no more will be put
                            forward. Missile costs will be absorbed. “Vanguard” is the only
                            addition. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he did
                            not know just where we will be next January with regard to missiles. The
                            President said that a budget must mean something—it is not a question of
                            simply adding on bits and pieces. It is the responsibility of all to
                            make it be a meaningful management document.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he is starting a
                            long-range study which should come up with a three-year program. He
                            thought it might be a good idea to start out with an allowable figure.
                            The President said he did not think as simple an approach as that is
                            possible. He felt the Chiefs, after thorough study, should indicate the
                            minimum.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said the Chiefs
                            do not pass on the question of an additional Forrestal carrier, or how
                            many B–52 wings there should be. The President responded vigorously to
                            this, saying that for example <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General
                                Twining</persName> should take up with <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Admiral Burke</persName> each major element proposed for the Navy,
                            and the outcome should be an agreement that if you (the Air Force) will
                            do thus and such, I will save thus and such out of my (Navy) budget. If
                            the Chiefs are not doing this, they should be doing it. This is a kind
                            of advice which they can give, and they should be required to give. When
                            he was a theater commander he did not allow each service to put in for
                            whatever it wanted; the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> are in his
                            mind simply a corporate combined commander. They should consider these
                            specific things together, and not waste so much of their time on
                            abstractions like roles and missions. If they are not doing this kind of
                            thing, what in the world are they doing?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said this
                            current action relates to the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>–57
                            budget. We should not get ahead of ourselves. He will have some very
                            definite ideas regarding <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>–58 and later
                            years. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said if
                            we bring in the guided missiles, we should drop out some manned aircraft
                            wings. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General Twining</persName> said they
                            planned to do so. The President indicated he would like to have
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General Twining</persName> in some day
                            soon to discuss with him the question of how many aircraft there should
                            be in each wing. He saw savings out of putting 45 in a single wing
                            rather than 30, providing the result is fewer wings.</p>
                        <p>At an earlier point the President said that we should be very careful in
                            answering questions about individual items and services when the answer
                            really turns on the bulk or totality of our armed strength. He also said
                            that we should not get fixed ideas about new <pb xml:id="pg_290" n="290" facs="0314"/>weapons supplanting old—for example, it would never be
                            possible to set up so many Nike batteries that the whole of the United
                            States was covered. Interceptors will continue to be required.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The present posture of U.S. forces provides ready forces equipped, as
                            appropriate, with atomic capability and the capacity to respond
                            selectively and flexibly to local aggression or general war. The
                            rapidity with which these forces could respond to local aggression is
                            dependent upon the forces required for a given situation, the
                            availability of transportation appropriate to the task, and the
                            availability and security of bases and communications. In some
                            geographic areas, response to local aggression would require the
                            temporary diversion of forces, <pb xml:id="pg_291" n="291" facs="0315"/>transportation, and other resources from planned initial tasks in a
                            general war. It is estimated that, in the event of a general war,
                            essential sea and air communications could be maintained, except in
                            certain areas peripheral to the Soviet Bloc, where U.S. and allied
                            capabilities would be marginal. While the Air Defense capabilities of
                            the continental United States are improving at an accelerated rate, the
                            increasing Soviet atomic stockpile, now estimated to include megaton
                            weapons, and the improved Soviet delivery capability have in effect made
                            any relative gain questionable. It is estimated that, at present, the
                            atomic-air retaliation capability of the United States would provide a
                            margin of relative advantage in general war to the United States and its
                            allies which, when exploited effectively by other military forces, would
                            assure eventual victory against the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The Joint Chiefs of Staff, therefore, view present
                            comparative military strengths with concern but with confidence, and
                            will continue to hold this view so long as the factor of atomic
                            advantage remains in the U.S. favor. This present comparison is not
                            bound to persist and may change. This change can come about at any time
                            through U.S. failure or Soviet success in many areas, including the cold
                            war, or through a combination of factors. The Joint Chiefs of Staff are
                            of the opinion that the present trend in our military position vis-à-vis
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is not sufficiently favorable
                            to warrant curtailment of existing programs.</p>

                        <p>The United States has, in the execution of its military programs,
                            improved the training of its armed forces and markedly enhanced their
                            striking power and over-all capability in the last four years.
                            Concurrent with the increasing delivery capability of <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>, certain carrier striking forces,
                            tactical air forces, and units employing missiles and projectiles armed
                            with atomic warheads have attained an offensive and defensive atomic
                            capability. This total capability has been substantially increased by
                            strategic deployment of atomic weapons systems. Furthermore, the
                            development of air-transportable equipment, new techniques and weapons
                            systems, along with the training of personnel have improved the
                            capability of the U.S. land, sea, and air forces to meet local
                            aggression as well as carry out tasks in event of general war.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>In due course, our present guided missiles capability will be increased
                            to the point where it will greatly augment the offensive and defensive
                            strength of our military forces. It must be borne in mind, however, that
                            accuracy, pay load, reliability, and increased intelligence requirements
                            are among the factors which will influence the future employment of
                            these missiles. The rate of assimilation of guided missiles <pb xml:id="pg_292" n="292" facs="0316"/>into our weapons systems will
                            be governed by demonstrated capabilities rather than promised
                            performance. Although certain guided missiles are already operational,
                            it is too early to predict with any degree of assurance the extent to
                            which the whole family of guided missiles may eventually replace current
                            weapons systems. Some measure of the rate of progress expected, however,
                            is set forth in the next succeeding paragraph.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>In the coming years the offensive and defensive forces of the United
                            States will be converted to atomic ready forces at an accelerated rate.
                            The availability of atomic weapons in virtually any size or
                            configuration will provide the capability to apply firepower
                            selectively. All Services are now expediting re-equipment of their
                            forces with new weapons and are instituting programs for changes in
                            organization and tactical dispositions to exploit the new weapons
                            systems as well as to meet the requirements of modern warfare. Examples
                            are:</p>

                            flexibility, and firepower or U.S. Army Forces will be progressively
                            improved. By 1965 Army weapons systems will have completed a
                            considerable transformation which is now in progress. Surface-to-surface
                            missiles will have partially replaced medium and heavy artillery.
                            Although conventional artillery weapons probably will still be retained
                            at the division direct support level, significant amounts of light and
                            medium conventional artillery will have been replaced by missiles
                            systems. Antiaircraft artillery will probably have been entirely
                            replaced by guided missiles systems. Divisional weapons other than
                            artillery will continue to be</p>

                            capable of operating the latest type jet aircraft, equipped with atomic
                            weapons and guided missiles. The Navy has two guided missiles cruisers
                            and at present is continuing the changeover in both cruisers and
                            destroyers to the use of antiaircraft defense missiles. Certain of the
                            aircraft carriers are presently equipped with Regulus launchers and
                            programs for surface-to-surface missiles in both submarines and surface
                            ships are under way. The Navy is continuing the development of improved

                            defense weapons. Fleet and task force dispositions have been modified to
                            provide greater defense against atomic attack. Amphibious operating
                            doctrine has been altered to make assault units less vulnerable in the
                            attack phase and to provide for more rapid envelopment of the beachhead

                        </p>
                        <p>(1) To maintain the essential confidence of our allies and their
                            alignment with us, especially in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>,
                            requires on our part implanting in their minds the complete conviction
                            that “U.S. strategy and policy serve their security as well as its own,
                            and that the United States is committed to their defense and possesses
                            the capability to fulfill that commitment.”<note n="3" xml:id="d73fn3">

                                the source text.]</note> At the same time we must emphasize that a
                            basic tenet of U.S. policy is to deter war in any form—not provoke
                            it.</p>
                        <p>(2) Basic to the maintenance of that essential degree of confidence on
                            the part of our allies is the U.S. requirement for retaining, both at
                            home and abroad, a strong military posture. To reinforce this position
                            of strength the Congress should, upon request, give the President
                            authority to act quickly in times of crisis, including the use of armed
                            forces (Taiwan Resolution).<note n="4" xml:id="d73fn4">State Depart. <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi> dated 7 Feb 1955. [Footnote in the

                        <p>(3) Besides convincing our allies of the basic United States aims as
                            regards their security, the United States in asserting its leadership
                            should show understanding and support for its allies in the immediate
                            problems they face outside the formal context of alliances, when
                            compatible with U.S. security interests.</p>

                        <p>(1) In addition to the above methods of fostering the strength of Free
                            World alliances, military aid programs furnish tangible evidence of the
                            U.S. aim to serve our allies’ security interests as well as our own. <pb xml:id="pg_294" n="294" facs="0318"/>Economy, however, dictates that
                            these programs be generally predicated upon eventual complete support of
                            forces by recipient countries. Furthermore, military aid should not
                            subsidize unrealistic national military or economic aspirations. Force
                            levels should be limited to country support capabilities except where
                            there are overriding requirements vital to U.S. national security. The
                            United States should advise nations to concentrate indigenous support
                            upon effective units essential to U.S. policies and war plans, and
                            reduce or eliminate support of others in order to minimize requirements
                            for U.S. aid.</p>
                        <p>(2) Those friendly nations which are incapable of coping with their own
                            internal security problems should, as a first requirement for Mutual
                            Security Act funds, be provided sufficient military and economic
                            assistance to insure the stability and Western orientation of their
                            governments. In order to achieve selectivity in providing military aid,
                            other than for internal security, the criteria used should be derived
                            from military necessity rather than from political considerations. Such
                            U.S. military assistance should be based on a long-range plan to support
                            specific national units which can be expected to contribute to the
                            successful accomplishment of U.S. war plans. Military aid based on other
                            considerations should be phased out as soon as practicable.</p>

                            it appears. On the military side, we must convince our allies by our

                            rejustifications must be shortened, and broader authority be granted to

                            equipment. The authority for determining the dollar values of country

                            delegated to the Secretary of Defense. Necessary political and economic
                            guidance required by the Secretary of Defense should be obtained from
                            the Secretary of State and Director, International Cooperation

                        <p>(2) It has become increasingly important that the United States be able

                        </p>
                        <p>(1) The development and maintenance of military strength in the United
                            States and among our major allies, while indispensable to Free World
                            security, has definite limitations in its application. Its principal
                            purpose is to deter the Soviet-Communist Bloc from overt military action
                            and, if aggression does occur, to oppose it promptly and
                            successfully.</p>
                        <p>(2) Deterred for the present from overt military action, the
                            Soviet-Communist Bloc is pursuing its expansionist objectives by
                            non-military means. As examples, the Bloc’s recent economic penetrations
                            into areas formerly associated exclusively with the West, its efforts to
                            create and exploit divisive issues among Free World countries, and its
                            encouragement of non-committed countries toward neutralism have resulted
                            in a marked depreciation of Western influence in these areas. Our
                            military mode of international action alone cannot be effective against
                            such tactics. It can only contribute, by deterring military action; thus

                            latter measures must carry the burden. In the final analysis, the
                            relative strengths of the opposing Blocs will, to a large extent, be
                            determined by the success of the non-military elements of our national
                            strategy.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>As pointed out above, the continuing effectiveness of our military
                            programs as a deterrent to war will be measured not only by visible
                            military strength, but by our success in achieving an unmistakable unity
                            of purpose and will to act in an emergency. It must be recognized that
                            the strength of a military alliance is not necessarily augmented by the
                            admittance of additional members. From the purely military standpoint,
                            the value of an additional member should be calculated on the basis of
                            its potentialcontribution in geography, forces, and strength of purpose.
                            A military alliance automatically involves certain additional
                            commitments. Nations have come to expect that alliance with the United
                            States entitles them not only to military protection but to an extensive
                            program of military and economic assistance over an indefinite period.
                            The United States cannot afford to give additional military commitments
                            or to scatter its substance to countries whose contribution to United
                            States and Free World security is either uncertain or of little value.
                            In such cases the United States should not exert pressure to make active
                            military allies of countries not so inclined.</p>

                        <p>The President referred to a memorandum on military and other requirements
                            for our national security which <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> had <pb xml:id="pg_297" n="297" facs="0321"/>sent

                            </note> While recognizing that the memorandum did not give a complete
                            treatment of its subjects, he thought that it began to give a better
                            grasp of the overall security problem than we have had up to now. He
                            thought that discussion in the latter sections (particularly those parts
                            relating to more selective application of military aid, and to economic
                            aid) should now be applied to the various areas and countries of the
                            world to see specifically what it would mean. Before doing so it might
                            be desirable to have comment by the Secretary of State or the Planning
                            Board on the document, particularly these sections. Out of such
                            application a more definite schedule of actions might be developed.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> said that, on
                            the basis of reading of State Department cables and military cables, he
                            sees more of the security picture, in all probability, than any other
                            single official. When he sees troubles beginning to show up, he tries to
                            get top people in Government interested in the matter—frequently without
                            much success. An example is the situation in Iceland, which turns on a
                            matter of sale of Icelandic fish. For $10 to $15 million a year this
                            incident could probably have been avoided. The President picked up his
                            comment about the difficulties of arousing interest until a crisis is at
                            hand, and said it showed the fallacy of relying on busy Cabinet officers
                            in this respect. They have no time to think about distant problems and
                            possibilities, but must concentrate on day-to-day activities. He said
                            that he had told the Icelanders in 1951 that he was sure they would
                            never be satisfied until they have some small force of their own—that
                            the presence of sizable foreign forces would always be a difficulty. We
                            could help them with such a force much more easily than in the field of
                            economic aid. <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName>
                            said that a survey is being made to see if we could reduce the number of
                            Americans on the Island, since this would help reduce the problem. (At
                            the present time, Icelanders allow only 120 Americans a day out of the
                            6000 on the Island off the base area.)</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> referred to
                            problems in Latin America, where the countries are obtaining military
                            equipment from the Communist countries. Also, a number of active trade
                            negotiations are going on.</p>
                        <p>The President spoke at length on his ideas concerning trade. He felt that
                            people approach the matter too narrowly. It is a certainty that nations
                            will trade with each other. We should concentrate on copper and a half
                            dozen items of most advanced machinery and electronics and encourage
                            trade in everything else. There is a feeling that only the Communists
                            would benefit from trade. He is confident that the West has skill in
                            trading such that a net advantage would probably lie with them. He did
                            see positive value in pressing forward with trade with the Satellites in
                            Eastern Europe. <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName>
                            said that we are <pb xml:id="pg_298" n="298" facs="0322"/>down to a very
                            few items in terms of trade with the Satellites. We should try, however,
                            to avoid giving them advanced items, thus letting them save the
                            developmental costs which are frequently quite great. The President
                            commented on how he understood Mr. Baruch has completely changed his
                            views as to trade—two years ago he thought we should be very
                            restrictive; today he would make trade completely free. <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> commented on how the
                            Communists use their trade delegations to “bore in”—also, how they use
                            their trade as a weapon for other objectives. The President said that if
                            it were possible to get agreement between State, Commerce, Defense, and
                                <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> as to what trade means to the
                            world, it might then be possible to get through a national program in
                            spite of the tendencies to demagoguery on this matter and the pressures
                            for restriction arising out of our high prices and high wage rates.</p>
                        <p>The President next turned to the question of how the new Chiefs of Staff
                            are making out in their work together—in particular, whether there are
                            problems respecting Army attitudes. <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> said there has been some problem of Army morale,
                            and the President recalled a recent conversation with his son which
                            brought out that the lack of a doctrine that assigns the Army a definite
                            and permanent mission has left them somewhat unsatisfied and even
                            bewildered. Their role is rather hazy to many of them.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> said he is
                            trying to point out to the Army that they have a great future—in terms
                            of mobile warfare. The first step toward that is to streamline their
                            requirements in the field. (Later he mentioned that the Army’s tendency
                            to resist basing its forces on an atomic concept tends to work in just
                            the wrong direction.) The President mentioned some of his recent
                            conversations with <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General
                                Taylor</persName> on Army aviation.<note n="3" xml:id="d74fn3">See
                                    <ref target="#d71">Document 71</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>At this point the President recalled an item he had seen in the newspaper
                            about a new Air Force airplane capable of 1000–1500 miles per hour, and
                            called Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> to ask
                            why it is necessary to have a big spread in the papers about this. He
                            stressed strongly the need to avoid this type of thing which leads only
                            to inter-Service “competitive publicity”.</p>

                        <p>I said to Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> that from a political
                            standpoint, I judged that the Soviet Union was now sufficiently
                            committed to policies of non-violence so that I doubted that we would
                            see from their side any repetition of the attack on South Korea. The
                            spot of greatest possible danger of a military character from the Soviet
                            Union was Iran. As regards Communist China, I felt that the risk was
                            greater than from Soviet Russia and that we could not assume that
                            fighting might not break out in any one of the three danger
                            spots—Taiwan, Vietnam or Korea. Of these perhaps the one chiefly
                            requiring local strength was Vietnam because there were no important
                            targets in that area for our retaliatory power and because the Chinese
                            Communists might act through the Vietminh.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Korea, and to a considerable extent in the case of Taiwan,
                            I felt that the deterrent of our striking power was very considerable
                            and that the need for local forces was primarily psychological.</p>
                        <p>I expressed the thought that military planning could take account of some
                            of the political changes resulting from the Soviet “new look”.</p>

                        <p>The President told <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> about the report he had just had from Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FJB1">Fisk</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d77fn2">Not
                                found in the Eisenhower Library or Department of State files.</note>
                            He said he regarded the problem as <pb xml:id="pg_302" n="302" facs="0326"/>primarily one of making the right decisions. It was not
                            a matter involving tremendous new outlays of funds, but an
                            organizational question. He indicated agreement to the thought that
                            there should be a Task Force approach, working on whole “systems”.
                            Gradually, through such a process, it would be possible to concentrate
                            attention on the truly critical elements and activities in the military
                            sphere. In that sense the matter is one of extending the “new look”. He
                            knew that <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName>
                            favored a more centralized type of approach to many of these problems,
                            and certainly felt that would be necessary. The President said he had
                            about reached the conclusion that some reorientation of the whole
                            organization ought to be made sometime next year. It would involve
                            strengthening the position of the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman
                            of <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, reducing the services to a more
                            operational, less policy role. Later, he spoke of making the Chiefs of
                            Staff in effect assistants to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs—i.e.,
                            giving him the power to select and to reassign them. The Chiefs would
                            then have the duty of implementing policy within their own service— not
                            of developing over-all policy.</p>
                        <p>The President went on to say that he wants to put in his State of the
                            Union message next January a very clear and direct statement as to the
                            types of military establishment we should be maintaining, reflecting
                            concentration on critical items as indicated above. Although this would
                            not be put forward until January, it must be worked out very thoroughly
                            ahead of time. He also said that he is thinking of asking for a new type
                            of oath to be taken by all military and civilian officials who serve in
                            the Pentagon—that on termination of their duty they will disclose
                            nothing which the Department of Defense determines to be security
                            information. He also said that he is planning to lay down stricter rules
                            with regard to possible statements by retired officers on matters of
                            governmental policy.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> said there is a
                            considerable problem arising through people getting into “difficulties”
                            in testimony before Congress—and that in some cases these difficulties
                            arise because of lack of wholehearted support for the Administration
                            position. He also said it is proving very difficult to get unanimity on
                            major plans. He cited the Joint Strategic Objectives Plan, in which the
                            question has arisen whether atomic weapons would be used in “small
                            wars”. If there is any planning on the basis that they would not, the
                            way is then left open for a building up of service requirements. The
                            President said he was inclined to feel that we would not get involved in
                            a “small war” extending beyond a few Marine battalions or Army units. If
                            it grew to anything like Korea proportions, the action would become one
                            for use of atomic weapons. Participation in small wars, in his opinion,
                            is primarily a matter for Navy and Air. Our job will be to support, but
                            not to engage our main forces which must be kept clear for larger scale
                                <pb xml:id="pg_303" n="303" facs="0327"/>hostilities. <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> said, for example,
                            that if there were trouble in Vietnam, we would certainly not move in
                            with large Army forces. The task for the Army would be to “beef up” the
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>s with Army personnel who could
                            serve as advisors to indigenous ground forces. In addition, we would no
                            doubt bring in Honest John, artillery and missile units to provide
                            support.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> then discussed a
                            proposal (which it appeared he had received from State) involving
                            holding a ship loaded with military equipment ready to give to Egypt if
                            aggressed upon, and a “stock pile” of F–86s (from Italy) to Israel if
                            attacked. He was concerned that such an arrangement would leak out. He
                            said he would like very much to discuss the whole matter with State
                            (there are some significant military questions involved) before any
                            decision in principle was taken. The President said it would be quite
                            all right to talk to State, since his whole idea had been that, if the
                            matter could be worked out in agreement, it would be okay with him.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> raised the
                            question as to the Field Marshal<note n="3" xml:id="d77fn3">Field

                            Standing Group might say the whole higher command should be changed at
                            the time <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">General Norstad</persName> takes

                        <p>The President referred to his recent meeting with Drs. <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FJB1">Fisk</persName>, in which they referred to the
                            need for accelerating the developing of high altitude radar, <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> dispersal, and quicker reaction time
                            for <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> in case of attack. He said there
                            was a general recommendation for <pb xml:id="pg_304" n="304" facs="0328"/>greater authority at the Defense level and less at the service level.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that the
                            1947 Unification Act<note n="3" xml:id="d78fn3">National Security Act of
                                1947 (Public Law 253); 61 Stat. 495.</note> in effect gave the
                            individual Chiefs and the Secretaries authority to go to the Congress
                            simply by notifying the Secretary of Defense. The President said that
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> feels the
                            need now for additional staff authority. He thought that the only way
                            open now is to call in individuals before they are appointed and ask for
                            their oath to accept decisions once made. The Secretary said that
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> had indicated
                            that 60,000 foot radar is technically “still not quite completely
                            ready”. Production cannot be started earlier than planned but the
                            completion of the program could be accelerated. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said the indication is that the
                            initial service budget estimates for 1958 will aggregate $50 billion
                            (later he said this included atomic energy and foreign aid). He thought
                            that consideration should be given as to how much should go into
                            forces-in-being and how much into weapons, both new weapons and
                            replacement and maintenance of what we have. He cited new projects such
                            as the nuclear-powered airplane and the nuclear-powered ballistic
                            missile which will absorb tremendous amounts of money.</p>
                        <p>The President said we must distinguish between a respectable posture of
                            defense, and an all-out military build-up. In the present situation, an
                            attempt to be completely secure could lead only to a garrison state, and
                            even then could not succeed. He thought that in addition to the present
                            major development programs, a few selected projects should be going
                            forward, but these should not be service projects but rather defense
                            projects.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> thought that our
                            intelligence is now over-estimating Soviet capabilities. The President
                            said that he saw a need on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s part to have a Defense staff (“General Staff”
                            is the term he used) to help him. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that a lot of the difficulty arises because
                            the services base their requests on commitments, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> papers, force levels, etc., which they say they can’t
                            change. The President said that many of these are outdated—for example,
                            the D-Day <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> commitments—but they
                            can’t be changed because a public outcry would develop, which would harm
                            our position with our allies as regards collective defense.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that we as a
                            nation have not yet recognized the fact that the Russians are coming to
                            the point where they will have the capabilities to destroy us just as we
                            will have the capability to destroy them. He felt that the recent
                            Russian announcement of a 1.2 million man reduction means that they
                            realize that there is no great ground threat to them, that there is
                            little need to maintain large ground armies, and they are cutting theirs
                            as a result.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_305" n="305" facs="0329"/>
                        <p>The President said he is inclined to think that the Chiefs of Staff
                            system we now have has failed. He had hoped the new Chiefs would do
                            better, because he knew they were fine men. Apparently the system is
                            wrong. He said he is astonished at what “one or two I have known all my
                            life” have done. He said he has found <persName corresp="#p_PLGRM1">General Pate</persName> (and General Shepherd before him) and
                                <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Admiral Burke</persName> very sensible
                            in everything he has seen of them. He said the great need is for
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> to find a way of
                            getting disinterested, competent advice, then deciding on a program, and
                            then “setting his teeth” and holding to it.</p>
                        <p>There was discussion regarding the correlation of scientific groups such
                            as <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName>’s with Defense, and
                            the President indicated he was ready for recommendations from Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> on this at any time.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he planned
                            to work up a list of a dozen or so things to be done bearing on the
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> recommendations, and
                            see how many of them the President wanted. The President said he wanted
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> to reach his judgment
                            as to what needs to be done and then report to him.</p>
                        <p>The President asked as to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s thoughts regarding the organizational points
                            made by Drs. <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_FJB1">Fisk</persName>. Colonel Randall said
                            they had related in part to the Continental Defense Command where
                            certain problems are under study now. I brought out that they related to
                            a “systems” approach at the Secretary of Defense level.</p>

                        <p>In the course of the discussion of the Turkish Progress Report, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> broadened the area
                            of discussion by pointing out that there were a large number of National
                            Security Council papers in circulation the terms of which required
                            military assistance to our friends and allies far beyond our
                            capabilities to pay for this assistance. In Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>’s view the people around the
                            table at this time must decide what is to be done about this basic
                            situation and to determine precisely how much the United States can
                            afford to spend around the world. After all, every U.S. housewife has to
                            budget her household expenditures and divide them up in terms of the
                            total that she is given.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed that this was the customary role of the housewife,
                            but pointed out to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> that if the housewife has a sick child she pays
                            the doctor, no matter what else happens. Similarly, we face emergencies
                            in the case of some of our allies. The President said he must admit,
                            however, that in the case of Turkey we have fooled around long enough.
                            It was high time to convince the Turks that they must be content with a
                            smaller military establishment. How were we going to convince an ally
                            that he should agree to such a reduction?</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> said that he had
                            not so very long ago talked over the problem of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> force goals, including force levels desirable in
                            Turkey, with General Gruenther in Paris. <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> pointed out that in the first instance
                            it is the responsibility of SACEUR to recommend appropriate <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> force levels, including Turkish force
                            levels. SACEUR actually is still basing his recommendations on the
                            Lisbon model of some years ago. [<hi rend="italic">1 sentence (39 words)

                            in the position of being able to say precisely what the United States is
                            prepared to do in the event of aggression, before we could hope for any
                            general reduction of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> force

                        <p>The President stated that he regarded present <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> strategic concepts as being completely outmoded and as
                            making no sense in the light of recent weapons developments and Soviet
                            strategy.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_307" n="307" facs="0331"/>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> expressed the
                            opinion that the current Soviet announcement of the reduction of its
                            conventional forces seemed to provide the appropriate opportunity to
                            review both our military aid programs and our own military force levels.
                            He added his belief that we must do something to meet the Soviet shift
                            of tactics and be prepared to meet a new kind of competition from the
                            Soviet Union. It was certainly logical for us to place greater emphasis
                            and reliance on our nuclear capabilities. This could very well mean a
                            reduction of the level of forces now being maintained in Korea, Formosa,
                            and elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>The President said that this business of arguing that you are going to
                            defend these countries through recourse to nuclear weapons isn’t very
                            convincing. In point of fact, these countries do not wish to be defended
                            by nuclear weapons. They all regard these weapons as essentially
                            offensive in character, and our allies are absolutely scared to death
                            that we will use such weapons. Of course, in the defense of the United
                            States itself we will certainly use nuclear weapons, but to use them in
                            other situations will prove very difficult.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> invited the
                            Council to consider the case of Iran. Here was a country which wanted a
                            large army, and the United States will have to support this army if it
                            is to be maintained at all. On the other hand, if the United States were
                            in a position to give clear assurance to Iran that we would use nuclear
                            weapons in order to protect Iran against Soviet aggression, we might
                            then induce them to agree to a reduction in the level of their armed
                            forces. But can we give such assurance to Iran and to the other members
                            of the Baghdad Pact?</p>
                        <p>In reply to <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName>, the
                            President insisted that Iran was a rather special case. The only way
                            that Iran could be attacked would be directly by Soviet forces, since
                            there were no satellites which the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            could send against Iran. Meanwhile, it has been made reasonably clear
                            that such a direct Soviet attack on Iran would be likely to provoke
                            global war. However, the situation in other areas, where satellite
                            forces could be brought to bear, is much less clear than the situation
                            in Iran.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> pointed out that
                            the desire of so many countries to maintain considerable ground forces
                            stemmed essentially from the fact that these countries fear that they
                            may have to face large Soviet land armies. Now, however, that the Soviet
                            seems to be shifting its military strategy, an opportunity is presented
                            to us to shift our own military strategy and to induce our allies in
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and elsewhere to shift
                            theirs.</p>
                        <p>The President said he hoped Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> was correct, but if our allies gradually ceased
                            to fear the aggression of Soviet land forces, they may now begin to
                            clamor for a costly continental defense system <pb xml:id="pg_308" n="308" facs="0332"/>against Soviet air atomic attack. <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> commented that it
                            would cost approximately $20 billion to construct an effective
                            continental defense system for the European <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> powers.</p>
                        <p>The President went on to comment that in a democratic country like the
                            United States there was a high degree of continuity in the conduct and
                            content of military and foreign policy. We cannot escape the demands of
                            of continuity and we cannot abruptly shift our policies as a
                            dictatorship could. Thus we have been urging the Turks in the past to
                            build up a considerable military establishment. We are now changing our
                            minds about the desirability of such a large Turkish military
                            establishment. It is nevertheless going to be very hard to tell the
                            Turks to stop.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> observed that as
                            far as he could see, this Administration was confronting two big policy
                            problems. First, simply to carry out current national security policies
                            is certain to cost billions more over the next few years than we have
                            been spending to carry out these policies up to the present time.
                            Secondly, our domestic economy is slipping. It was for this reason, said
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, that he had
                            earlier remarked that he was in favor of securing our headquarters
                            before we tried to secure our military outposts. <note n="3" xml:id="d79fn3">During the 283d meeting of the National Security
                                Council on May 3, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> and the President had discussed the matter
                                of spending money on bases abroad, instead of concentrating on bases
                                in the continental United States. This conversation included the
                                following exchange:<p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> expressed the view that all this money
                                    being spent on bases throughout the world would be much better
                                    spent on producing B–52 aircraft in the United States. Think of
                                    all the money that the United States had poured into Formosa.
                                    Think of what it would have brought us in terms of B–52
                                    aircraft. In the last analysis, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, the United States
                                    will stand or fall on how strong we are. We must begin to be
                                    selective in our assistance to our allies, in a way we have
                                    never even approached before.</p>
                                <p>“The President replied that the matter of bases was nowhere near
                                    as simple as Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> indicated. We could do a lot more
                                    damage to the enemy with a small or medium bomber from the ring
                                    of nearby U.S. bases than we could inflict with much larger
                                    bombers based in the continental United States. It was
                                    unthinkable that we should abandon our bases around the
                                    periphery of the Soviet Union. Perhaps, speculated the
                                    President, what this Government should do is to sit down and
                                    agree on the total amount of money to be allocated to the
                                    defense of the United States, and agree thereafter on the
                                    rational division of this total amount among the various
                                    competing claims.</p>
                                <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>
                                    expressed absolute agreement with the President’s last thought.
                                    In his opinion we should decide precisely how much we can afford
                                    to spend for defense purposes, and then divide up the total on a
                                    carefully selective basis.</p>
                                <p>“The President said that the heart of the foreign assistance
                                    problem was the question of the eventual cost to the United
                                    States of any given ally, and how much that ally was worth to
                                    us. This was something which we ought to be able to calculate
                                    and thus reach a conclusion on how many allies we can afford to
                                    have.” (Memorandum of discussion; Eisenhower Library, Whitman
                                    File, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Records)</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that he
                            agreed with both the points just made by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>. He was worried, he said, both
                            about the short-term and long-term prospects for the U.S. economy.
                            Despite <pb xml:id="pg_309" n="309" facs="0333"/>severe short-term
                            problems, he added, he believed that the long-term problems were even
                            more serious. We were simply taking too much money out of our people in
                            the form of taxes. We are doing this to a greater extent than any other
                            country in the world. For example, we are spending approximately $45
                            billion a year on our national security, and about every five years
                            these expenditures go down the drain and we have to begin all over
                            again. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> then
                            invited the Council to imagine the effect on the U.S. economy if we
                            could cut perhaps $15 billion from the $45 billion that our security
                            programs cost. If this were reinvested it would create vast numbers of
                            new jobs and considerably expand the size and improve the health of the
                            national economy.</p>
                        <p>The President complained that he had been using this very argument
                            countless times with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName>, and the U.S. Chiefs of Staff. Yet every time
                            they came in to talk with him about these matters they always ended by
                            raising the ante and insisting that more money was required if the
                            Services were to meet their commitments.</p>
                        <p>In any event, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, he strongly felt that the meeting today of the
                            National Security Council was the best thing that had happened to it for
                            a very long time. The problems discussed today were precisely those that
                            the National Security Council had been created to discuss.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> made reference to
                            the current heavy criticism on the Hill and in the press on the alleged
                            shortcomings of the Defense Department’s programs. He confessed that he
                            did not quite know how to meet these criticisms. Moreover, things would
                            be a lot worse when the economy starts to go down, as the results of the
                            first quarter of the year had shown it was going to do. The many
                            requirements for carrying out the current programs of the Defense
                            Department were steadily increasing. Difficult as it was to make changes
                            in these programs, the time had come when we must really take a good
                            hard look at the situation.</p>
                        <p>The President recalled the period in the Administration’s early days when
                            we were carrying through the so-called “new look” strategy. At that time
                            we not only had <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">General Ridgway</persName>
                            raising hell, but on top of this we had the Congress insisting that we
                            spend more and even appropriating funds for the Marine Corps over and
                            above those requested by the Administration. What could we do in the
                            face of this kind of Congressional action?</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> said he felt sure
                            that the recent Soviet move to reduce the level of the Soviet armed
                            forces reflected in good part the success of the Administration’s
                            policies to date. Now, however, we are facing new problems and a new
                            situation, and we should realize this fact.</p>

                        <p>The President said our first task was to educate the American people and
                            the Congress. The National Security Council could be as wise as so many
                            Solomons and yet end in complete failure if we cannot convince the
                            public and the Congress of the wisdom of our decisions.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> then reverted to
                            the President’s earlier remark as to the completely outmoded <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> strategy. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he agreed that the current
                            force levels in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> were unrealistic
                            in view of the new weapons systems and changing Soviet strategy. Yet the
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> powers cannot or will not
                            change these levels. The President’s response was a statement that if
                            our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies are not willing to
                            stand by us, even though they are as aware as we are of the necessity of
                            unity in the face of the Communist danger, then the United States would
                            indeed have to undertake an agonizing reappraisal of its policies.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> commented that,
                            try as they would, he and <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> simply could not carry out their commitments on
                            the basis of the budgets on which the Defense Department now operates.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName>’s confirmation of this
                            statement, and <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName>
                            expressed agreement.</p>

                        <p>a. Agreed that continuation of all military programs in foreign countries
                            receiving U.S. military and supporting assistance which approved <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> policies are now construed to

                        <p>(1) Will in the aggregate require U.S. resources beyond those which are

                            even if supplemented by acceptable levels of U.S. assistance.</p>
                        <p>(3) May, in the light of new weapons systems and recent changes in
                            Soviet-Communist strategy, not prove to be the most effective means of
                            achieving U.S. national security objectives.</p>
                        <p>b. Agreed that in the forthcoming review of country policies pursuant to

                        <p>The meeting was held at <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General
                                Taylor</persName>’s request. He started with the statement that the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff have the Joint Strategic Objectives Plan for
                                1960<note n="2" xml:id="d80fn2">Not found in the Eisenhower Library
                                or Department of State files.</note> before them at the present
                            time. Through it, the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> will give
                            guidance to the staffs which will serve as the basis for programs and
                            funds. The paper is now split, with the Army and Marines following
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602, as he understands it, and
                            with the Air Force, the Navy and <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> taking the view that all planning must be based
                            upon the use of atomic weapons. He stressed that the plan pertains to
                            1960, by which time both sides will have developed large stockpiles of
                            thermonuclear weapons. A situation of mutual deterrence must be
                            envisaged. He recognized that a big war, under <pb xml:id="pg_312" n="312" facs="0336"/>such conditions, might come deliberately, but
                            thought it was more likely that it would come through “backing” into it
                            through a succession of actions and counteractions. In view of the
                            tendency of thermonuclear capacity to deter both sides from a big war,
                            any war that occurred would seem more likely to be a small war.</p>
                        <p>Two differences of view have developed within the Chiefs. The first
                            relates to the definition of general war used as the basis for the plan.
                            This is defined to be a war between the United States and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, using atomic weapons from the outset
                            without restriction. The emphasis is on war starting with large-scale
                            attack on D-Day, whereas the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> has
                            considered that it might arise step by step from smaller action. He said
                            that the Air Force and Navy members regard this as the worst possible
                            case, and therefore state that it would provide for all the others. He
                            is inclined to disagree with this. He feels that this concept would
                            leave us less flexible, and that the programs for fighting a big war
                            would absorb all available funds.</p>
                        <p>The second difference arises in the firm commitment for the use of atomic
                            weapons—in every case in a general war, and also in local wars where
                            required for military reasons. He thought that this contravened the
                            principle of “flexibility” which has been worked into <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> papers, and that it would result in
                            tremendous atomic forces and defenses against them, tending to freeze
                            out all other types of military forces— and that these latter are what
                            would be needed to handle small war situations.</p>
                        <p>The President said he thought <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General
                                Taylor</persName>’s position was dependent on an assumption that we
                            are opposed by people who would think as we do with regard to the value
                            of human life. But they do not, as shown in many incidents from the last
                            war. We have no basis for thinking that they abhor destruction as we do.
                            In the event they should decide to go to war, the pressure on them to
                            use atomic weapons in a sudden blow would be extremely great. He did not
                            see any basis for thinking other than that they would use these weapons
                            at once, and in full force. The President went on to say that he did not
                            care too much for the definition of general war as given. To him the
                            question was simply one of a war between the United States and the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and in this he felt that
                            thinking should be based on the use of atomic weapons—that in his
                            opinion it was fatuous to think that the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would be locked into a life and death
                            struggle without using such weapons. We should therefore develop our
                            readiness on the basis of use of atomic weapons by both sides. He
                            recalled that the United States had never been “scared” until these
                            weapons came into the picture, and it is this type of war which
                            justifies the great peacetime efforts we are now maintaining.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_313" n="313" facs="0337"/>
                        <p>As to local wars, the President thought that the tactical use of atomic
                            weapons against military targets would be no more likely to trigger off
                            a big war than the use of twenty-ton “blockbusters.” In his opinion, we
                            must concentrate on building up internal security forces and local
                            security forces of the regions themselves. We would give mobile support,
                            with the Air, Navy and Army supporting weapons, and perhaps put in
                            several battalions at truly critical points. He was very clear that we
                            would not, however, deploy and tie down our forces around the Soviet
                            periphery in small wars. He thought that the support forces we provide
                            would use the most efficient weapons, and over the past several years
                            tactical atomic weapons have come to be practically accepted as integral
                            parts of modern armed forces.</p>
                        <p>The President went on to refer to the ideas of movement of large numbers
                            of divisions in the the early months of an atomic war. He thought it was
                            very unlikely that they could be moved, and thought that military
                            planning is now emphasizing the forces immediately available, with much
                            less interest in those following by months. The incorporation of new
                            weapons such as rockets and missiles into the ground forces, with small
                            mobile combat groups integrating their operations closely with them,
                            should be stressed. General Gruenther had told him that he badly needs
                            the two U.S. divisions shown to be sent to Europe in the first thirty
                            days, but that when the President asked him how they could be gotten
                            there, he simply said that was his (the President’s) problem. The
                            President did not consider that anything like ten or twelve additional
                            divisions in the first six months could be moved. If we have been
                            heavily attacked, there would be neither the planes nor the air bases
                            needed to take them there. He added that he thought Europe had come a
                            great way toward this same manner of thinking.</p>
                        <p>Referring now to general war (the President used this term and “war
                            between the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>”
                            interchangeably), the President said that prudence would demand that we
                            get our striking force into the air immediately upon notice of hostile
                            action by the Soviets. Massive retaliation, although the term has been
                            scoffed at, is likely to be the key to survival. He reiterated that
                            planning should go ahead on the basis of the use of tactical atomic
                            weapons against military targets in any small war in which the United
                            States might be involved.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Taylor</persName> drew attention to
                            deterrence as the key factor in our present situation. We need diverse
                            types of forces to deter large wars, and small wars as well. If we
                            proceed on the basis of needs for actually fighting atomic wars, the
                            needs for atomic striking forces and for continental defense are
                            open-ended—practically limitless. He thought we should first calculate
                            what is needed for deterrence and provide that (rather than what is
                            needed for fighting an all-out thermonuclear <pb xml:id="pg_314" n="314" facs="0338"/>war), should then provide the requirements for flexible
                            forces usable in small wars, and finally put what remaining effort we
                            have into the requirements for fighting an all-out war.</p>
                        <p>The President said he was very understanding that the position he had
                            described did not leave the Army the same great role in the first year
                            of war in relation to the other services as formerly. In his opinion, in
                            the initial stages the Army would be truly vital to the establishment
                            and maintenance of order in the United States. He went on to say that
                            the Chiefs of Staff still thought much too much each in terms of his own
                            service. He thought that each service should have what the corporate
                            judgment of the Chiefs thought proper. He said that if the Chiefs can’t
                            develop corporate judgment on the great problems that are facing us, the
                            system as we now have it will have failed and major changes must be
                            made. He referred to recent criticisms of the capabilities of carriers.
                            He said that even if these charges are right, they should not be made in
                            public; it is a matter that should be thrashed out in deepest security
                            within the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>. We shouldn’t tell an
                            enemy our weaknesses—if they are weaknesses—and shouldn’t damage the
                            confidence of our people and our allies in these weapons if they are as
                            effective as he thinks they are. Similarly, the public criticism of the
                            Nike is damaging to our country. If it is not a good weapon, we should
                            determine that privately, and not notify the enemy but make our own
                            corrections. Again, if it is a good weapon, we are harming the
                            confidence of our public and our allies through this type of criticism.
                            He recognizes that there are going to be differences of view, but
                            considers that they should be worked out by the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>. All should be thinking of the good of the country
                            rather than attaining gains for a particular service. The President said
                            he would like to see a Nike test firing, but has felt unable to do so
                            because of the need to give psychological support to peaceful rather
                            than military things.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Taylor</persName> said that the
                            decision of the President will initiate fundamental and rather drastic
                            changes. The President did not feel that they would be too drastic. He
                            said that, in any case, we are going to keep forces in the Far East and
                            in Europe (even though the concept in Europe had been to have them there
                            for a short period only—now it looks as though they must stay almost
                            indefinitely). He felt that in the emphasis he has given on the atomic
                            weapons lies the greatest safety and security for our country. He did
                            not claim to be all wise in such matters, but he was very sure that as
                            long as he is President he would meet an attack in the way indicated.
                            With regard to the budget, while stressing the need to maintain the
                            economic soundness of the U.S.— and specifically to avoid tax levels
                            which would prevent the building up of capital productive industry, the
                            President said he has told everyone that we must have what we need for
                            security. He anticipates a fairly stable estimate which might be of the
                            order, in his opinion, of <pb xml:id="pg_315" n="315" facs="0339"/>$37
                            billion. <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> said
                            that the decision of the President, in his opinion, supported the
                            majority view, and <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General
                                Taylor</persName> agreed. <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> said that the decision will have some
                            far-reaching effects. For example, we should now tell our allies that
                            support will be as the President described. If they can plan on that,
                            they could cut down some of their forces. It might well mean that we
                            would put into their country units such as Honest
                                <persName>John</persName> and missiles with atomic warheads as
                            support elements. The President said that these changes and others to be
                            made would not necessarily be radical, but could be gradually
                            applied.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> referred to
                            additional requests coming in for programs that would run above the
                            “maintenance level” the Chiefs had spoken of on their return from Puerto
                            Rico. The Air Force will be coming in for an increase in strategic air
                            units, partly needed because the problem of penetrating to targets will
                            be becoming increasingly severe. The President thought that the
                            development of higher, faster aircraft relates to this purpose.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> said we
                            still have a big program to carry out regarding Continental Defense,
                            dispersal of air fields, and provision of guided missile air defense. He
                            said there has never been complexity equal to this in terms of military
                            planning.</p>
                        <p>The President thought there was need for a group like the advisory board
                            he constituted while Chief of Staff. That produced no memos but
                            concentrated on thinking about the major problems of the military
                            forces. They were, with one exception, retired officers having no
                            further assignments in view. Such a group under the Secretary of Defense
                            or <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> composed of senior officers
                            divorced from service, with a few scientists added, would be of the
                            greatest value.</p>

                        <p>The principal substantive point in this paper relates to the great

                                Program (Summary),” September 5, 1956. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.)</note>) In essence, the general agreement in the
                            intelligence community is that the Soviets have a much greater supply of
                            nuclear materials (U–235) than was estimated last year. You will recall
                            that in describing the damage which could be done to the U.S. in 1958
                            the Subcommittee stated that if the Soviet capabilities were much
                            greater than estimated, doubt would be raised as to whether they could
                            then deal a “decisive” attack on the U.S. as opposed to a “crippling”
                            attack.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the Planning Board’s work on this paper, Mr. Robert
                            Sprague, the present <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Consultant on
                            continental defense, has raised questions concerning the adequacy of
                            several specific defense programs and he may do so at the Council
                            meeting.</p>

                        <p>It is always difficult to decide how far State should go in commenting on
                            specific matters of a military nature. All that I can suggest is that as
                            the conversation proceeds during the Council meeting you attempt by
                            questions to satisfy yourself that the Department of Defense is not
                            endangering the protection of our retaliatory capability by economies.
                            You will note in this connection that the paper makes the protection of
                            this capability the prime goal of continental defense (see paragraph
                            10).</p>
                        <p>With respect to the difference of opinion in paragraphs 24 and 25 on
                            protection of industry and on civil defense we took no position because
                            on the one hand such programs as might be approved could cost a great
                            deal of money and, on the other hand, the justification therefor,
                            particularly if there is to be a continuation of a fairly strict
                            budgetary ceiling, was not presented at the Planning Board. I believe,
                            for instance, that civil defense needs more support, but if the shelter
                            program is to cost several billion additional, this is a matter of such
                            importance as to require a special <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>

                                <persName>Dulles</persName> said that he would summarize the latest

                            of fissionable material for the Soviet programs both for peaceful uses
                            and for the development of a nuclear capability for war.<note n="2" xml:id="d82fn2">Reference presumably is to <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11–2–56, “The Soviet Atomic Energy Program,” dated

                            Recent intelligence had resulted in revising the estimate of
                            availability of fissionable material upward by a [<hi rend="italic">3
                                words not declassified</hi>]. Very great importance <pb xml:id="pg_318" n="318" facs="0342"/>was attached to the estimate by
                            the intelligence community, and accordingly, and because the subject was
                            extremely complicated, Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said he would
                            read the estimate. He touched upon weapons developments since the
                            airburst of November 22, 1955. He then discussed the estimated
                            production of plutonium and of U–233 [<hi rend="italic">235</hi>?]. He
                            then touched on the revised estimate of the Soviet production of U–235,
                            which he emphasized had now been revised upward by a [<hi rend="italic">3 words not declassified</hi>]. In this respect he called attention
                            to the dissenting view of two members of the Intelligence Advisory
                            Committee, who believed that the production of U–235 should be revised
                            upward by [<hi rend="italic">7 words not declassified</hi>]. Lastly, he
                            mentioned the possible allocation of Soviet fissionable material among
                            the various types and sizes of nuclear weapons. He noted the relation of
                            this increased Soviet capability to the conclusions reached in the last
                            study by the Net Evaluation Subcommittee on the net capability of the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to inflict damage on the
                            United States by a nuclear attack. He also pointed out the impact of the
                            revised estimate on the Soviet program for the development of nuclear
                            energy for peaceful uses, both in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and abroad.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> summed up his findings with the statement
                            that it was estimated that the Soviet Union now has a significant
                            multimegaton capability and will in the near future have a major
                            multimegaton capability. In concluding, Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>
                            suggested that other members of the Council might like to comment on
                            this new estimate.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> said he wished
                            to remind the members of the Council of the possibilities of error in
                            this new estimate, which possibilities he said were admitted by those
                            who were responsible for the new estimate. Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> said that the possibility of error was
                            clearly admitted by the estimators, and <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> continued with a statement that the
                            Council should not get the erroneous impression that they had been
                            listening to undoubted facts with respect to the revised estimate of
                            Soviet nuclear capabilities.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President speculated that [<hi rend="italic">23 words not
                                declassified</hi>] the new estimate might represent a Soviet effort
                            to mislead the Western powers. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that
                            for technical reasons it would not be easy for the Russians to fudge our
                            knowledge of their stockpile. [<hi rend="italic">3 sentences (68 words)
                                not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>With reference to the views of the dissenting members of the <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss>, the Vice President said that an
                            increase in the Soviet stockpile of U–235 by a [<hi rend="italic">3
                                words not declassified</hi>] was in itself so significant that he
                            failed to see that it made any real difference whether the increase was
                            by a [<hi rend="italic">9 words not declassified</hi>] as the majority
                            believed.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Strauss agreed emphatically with the Vice President that the
                            estimated increase was of enormous significance, whichever estimate was
                            correct. On the other hand, Admiral Strauss said, he was not <pb xml:id="pg_319" n="319" facs="0343"/>greatly concerned over the
                            effect of this increase in the amount of fissionable material on the
                            Soviet program for the construction of power reactors for peaceful
                            purposes. Indeed, said Admiral Strauss, he wished the Soviets would
                            divert more of their fissionable material from their stockpile for the
                            power reactor program, since this would mean less for their weapons
                            program. However, he doubted that they would follow this course, and
                            expressed the opinion that the Soviet power reactor program was “largely
                            moonshine”.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Strauss then referred to the so-called <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> Committee timetable with
                            respect to the period at which the Soviet Union could be expected to
                            achieve a multimegaton capability sufficient to launch a crippling or a
                            decisive attack upon the United States. He insisted that when the
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> Committee’s
                            timetable had first come to the attention of the National Security
                            Council, he had not believed that it was altogether realistic. He now
                            believed even more emphatically than he had earlier that the critical
                            period for the United States with respect to the nuclear capabilities of
                            the Soviet Union would be reached at the end of 1957 or at the beginning
                            of 1958, rather than in 1959 as initially set forth in the <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> Committee timetable.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> then brought up the factor of
                            deliverability of atomic weapons as a crucial part of the Soviet Union’s
                            capability to launch a nuclear attack on the United States. He suggested
                            that <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> comment on
                            this subject.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> replied that he
                            had already pointed out the importance of the deliverability factor, in
                            his 31 May memorandum to Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> (transmitted
                            by the reference memorandum of June 7)<note n="3" xml:id="d82fn3">See
                                    <ref target="#d81fn4">footnote 4</ref>, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note> which the Council now had before it in
                            connection with the subject of continental defense. Moreover, continued
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName>, the
                            so-called new intelligence on the size of the Soviet stockpile of U–235
                            was in one sense not really new at all. The National Security Council
                            has known for a long time that the United States would at no very
                            distant time have to face up to the situation which was now at hand if
                            the revised estimate was correct. Indeed, in all our planning to date we
                            have assumed that the Soviet Union would have a multimegaton nuclear
                            capability at some future date. According to the new estimate, this date
                            was now nearer rather than more remote.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> commented that
                            the net of the new intelligence estimate which had been read by Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName>, was to emphasize a radical change in
                            the estimate of the time at which the Soviet Union would achieve a
                            multimegaton nuclear capability. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> then inquired of Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> whether the latter felt more secure
                            about the reliability of this new estimate of availability than he had
                            about the previous estimates on this subject. Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> replied in <pb xml:id="pg_320" n="320" facs="0344"/>the affirmative, on grounds that much more evidence was
                            available to support this estimate than had been available for its
                            predecessors. It was clear, he added, that the Soviets have been putting
                            a lot more energy into their program for the development of nuclear
                            weapons than they had previously. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>
                            pointed out that the new estimate he had read did not go into the matter
                            of deliverability of weapons because this matter had not been in the
                            specific terms of reference of the new estimate.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> inquired whether
                            if, as the estimate suggested, the Soviets were relatively short in the
                            production of plutonium, this shortage would not be remedied by the
                            securing of plutonium as a by-product of the processing of U–235 in
                            Soviet power reactors. Such plutonium would then be available for the
                            Soviet nuclear weapons program.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Strauss replied that this was probably true, but that the United
                            States did a better job in this area by making use of a reactor
                            specifically designed to produce plutonium rather than to secure it as a
                            by-product. Admiral Strauss then went on to say that he had been so
                            worried and concerned about the new intelligence on the Soviet stockpile
                            of U–235, that he had gone over the findings of the estimate with a
                            fine-tooth comb. He added that he was convinced that the new estimate
                            was as nearly correct as we could possibly expect. We were badly enough
                            off if the availability of U–235 to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> must be increased by a [<hi rend="italic">3 words not
                                declassified</hi>]. It was much worse, of course, if the stockpile
                            was [<hi rend="italic">2 words not declassified</hi>] as large as we had
                            estimated before the new intelligence became available. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> suggested that it was always
                            possible that they might have even more than [<hi rend="italic">2 words
                                not declassified</hi>] as much as the new estimate suggested.
                            Admiral Strauss admitted that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> might be right, but he felt that this was less
                            likely than that they had less than [<hi rend="italic">2 words not
                                declassified</hi>] the amount we had previously estimated that they
                            had.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> commented that while essentially he did
                            not disagree with the view of Admiral Strauss with respect to the Soviet
                            program for the development of power reactors, the Council should
                            realize that the Soviets are quite prepared to resort to an economic
                            program for the construction of power reactors simply because of the
                            political and propaganda advantages which they might derive from such a
                            power reactor program. Admiral Strauss expressed great doubt that the
                            Soviets would ever be willing to divert large amounts of fissionable
                            materials from their weapons program to be used for their power program.
                            In the same vein, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that the Council did not need to get very
                            excited about any economic activity that was not really economically
                            sound in character.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Noted and discussed an oral briefing by the Director of Central
                            Intelligence on the subject, with specific reference to increasing
                            Chinese Communist industrial potential; the situation in Israel; the
                            forthcoming visit of the new Soviet Foreign Minister to Cairo; the
                            situation in Pakistan; and the revised estimate of the Soviet stockpile
                            of fissionable material and of the Soviet nuclear power program.</p>
                        <p>As the discussion of the previous item drew to a close, the Vice
                            President said that this discussion led naturally to a consideration of
                            the next item on the Council agenda—namely, continental defense. He
                            said, however, that he would like to interrupt the transition long
                            enough to warn the Council of what bad shape the Administration’s mutual
                            security program was in, so far as Congress was concerned. <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon Johnson</persName>
                            <note n="5" xml:id="d82fn5">Senator <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon
                                    B. Johnson</persName> (D–Tex.), Senate Majority Leader.</note>
                            had informed him that at a recent poll of Democratic Senators, 31 of
                            these Senators were recorded as favoring the billion-dollar cut made by
                            the House, while only 17 were in favor of restoring at least part of the
                            cuts made by the House.</p>
                        <p>With respect to this situation, the Vice President said he would like to
                            make two suggestions. First, if <persName corresp="#p_PMGWB1">General
                                Persons</persName> called on any member of the Council to speak in
                            favor of the bill to certain Senators, he hoped that this member would
                            respond favorably. Second, if any member of the Council had any useful
                            proposals to make on the subject, would he please get in touch with
                            Governor <persName corresp="#p_AS1">Adams</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_PMGWB1">General Persons</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President then went on to say that what was happening to the
                            mutual security bill represented in a sense another failure on the part
                            of Congress to follow the President’s leadership. Despite the fact that
                            the leadership in both houses of the Congress is behind the President’s
                            mutual security program, it was significant that while Sam Rayburn<note n="6" xml:id="d82fn6">Representative Sam Rayburn (D–Tex.), Speaker
                                of the House.</note> favored the Senate committee’s proposal to
                            restore part of the cut, all 21 Texas Representatives opposed
                            restoration of the cut. The Vice President said that this vote
                            represented a reaction by these members of the Congress to grass roots
                            opposition to the foreign aid program. Accordingly, we must undertake
                            the urgent job of convincing the Democrats, and especially of convincing
                            the Republicans, to support the Administration’s position.</p>

                            At the conclusion of Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName>’s briefing, the
                            Vice President turned to the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said he wished
                            to state that <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5606 represented a
                            most timely development and one of the greatest possible significance.
                            We were now face to face clearly with a situation that all of us had for
                            a long time realized was a strong possibility. This derived not merely
                            from the new intelligence on increased Soviet nuclear capabilities, but
                            was also the result of the tendency of the National Security Council and
                            the Executive agencies to construct piecemeal national security programs
                            as we went along. As <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> had so often remarked in the Council, we have
                            been adding on new requirements steadily, and they had now led to
                            incredible future expenditures <pb xml:id="pg_323" n="323" facs="0347"/>which were in fact far beyond anything which the Administration was
                            actually contemplating. This particular report on continental defense
                            policy very well illustrates the general point he had just been making,
                            with this terrific jump in expenditures for the continental defense of
                            the United States. Moreover, for the moment at least there was
                            apparently no reduction contemplated in any other national security
                            program to compensate for the proposed great increase in the program for
                            continental defense. On the contrary, all the other national security
                            programs were continuing to require increased expenditure. Accordingly,
                            the President’s recent request in connection with the annual reports on
                            the status of each of the national security programs, as of the 30th of
                            June, should contain three-year projections of costs, was absolutely
                            essential, [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] Only thus could the National
                            Security Council at an early date get a glance at the over-all picture
                            of our programs and their estimated cost over the next few years. If the
                            picture for all these other national security programs looked like the
                            picture presented by the present report on the continental defense
                            programs, this would involve a drastic reconsideration of our national
                            security objectives, where we are and where we were going in the
                            future.</p>
                        <p>In short, continued Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, the people of the United States haven’t any
                            idea in the world that their Government plans expenditures of the
                            magnitude suggested by the estimates in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5606. If we propose to make such expenditures in the
                            future, this will involve drastic changes in our national security
                            policies and a very great effort to readjust the thinking of the
                            American people along very different lines. In point of fact, they are
                            at present thinking in terms of a tax reduction rather than a tax
                            increase. In fact, the Administration is going to have a real battle on
                            its hands in trying to avoid a tax reduction this year. In conclusion,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> repeated his
                            view that the present report on continental defense policies was one of
                            the most important things that the Council had ever done, and we must go
                            on from here to get similar reports on the other major national security
                            programs, in order that at long last we could see the over-all picture
                            of where we are going and what we are going to do about it.</p>
                        <p>The Director of the Bureau of the Budget then stated that he wished in
                            the first instance strongly to support the position taken by Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>. Thereafter,
                            however, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> said he
                            thought that the reports mentioned by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> should be supplemented by
                            still other reports to make the over-all picture complete. Thus Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> called for a report
                            from Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> on the
                            prospects for peace and disarmament. He called for a report by Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> (who had joined the
                            meeting when the subject of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5606
                            came up) for a report on the diplomatic and political outlook. <pb xml:id="pg_324" n="324" facs="0348"/>Finally, he called for a report
                            “by our sociologists and educators” as to what kind of a country the
                            citizens of the United States would like to have in the course of the
                            coming years.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> said that he would
                            like to make two comments to the Council. First, he wished to state his
                            complete agreement with the views just enunciated by the Secretary of
                            the Treasury. Indeed, we did need the frame of reference for which
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> was calling,
                            and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSJ1">Lay</persName>’s directive that the
                            June 30 status reports should each contain three-year cost projections
                            was of great significance. These reports would provide the checklist of
                            all our basic national security policies and programs. When we sat down
                            and put all these together, we would know what we were doing and where
                            we were going.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> said he
                            wished to comment on the specific paper before the Council, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5606. He felt that this report on
                            continental defense placed before the National Security Council the most
                            serious situation that the Council had faced since it had originally got
                            together at the beginning of the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Administration. This was especially true in
                            terms of the so-called timetable. It was now clear that we had much less
                            time than we thought we had before the Soviet Union will have achieved a
                            capability to deliver a crippling or decisive attack on the United
                            States. At this point Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> summarized the so-called <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> Committee timetable, with
                            particular respect to Period III—B, the period in which, unless our
                            continental defense programs were fully effective and kept up, the
                            Soviet Union would have achieved the capability of a decisive surprise
                            attack on the United States. The <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> Committee had said that such a period as III—B
                            could come as early as 1958. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> believed that it was now clear that this period
                            could approach earlier than 1958, and might even now be imminent.
                            Accordingly, the present paper must be considered by the National
                            Security Council in the light of this possibility.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> then said that he had
                            appreciated the position taken by his representative on the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning Board, Dr. Elliot, when he had
                            stated, contrary to the view of the majority, that even before 1958 the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> may be able to develop a net
                            capability to strike a possibly decisive blow at the United States;
                            whereas the majority on the Planning Board had used the term “a
                            crippling attack” (paragraph 1 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            5606). However, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> went
                            on to say that he was not concerned with arguing about wording, in view
                            of the fact that the Council had heard in the last Net Evaluation
                            Subcommittee report that casualties in the event of a Soviet nuclear
                            attack on the United States would run as high as 24 million people. Even
                            if casualties of this magnitude implied only a crippling rather than a
                            decisive attack, such casualty figures were quite enough in their
                            significance for Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName>.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_325" n="325" facs="0349"/>
                        <p>Thereafter, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> pointed
                            out that the proposed continental defense program in its entirety
                            provided one of the most effective deterrents to war that could be
                            imagined. Accordingly, it was essential that the continental defense
                            program be kept strong. This, of course, raised the question of
                            accelerating certain continental defense programs. This precise question
                            was not before the Council today, and would only come before the Council
                            in July, after reports by the Department of Defense on the vulnerability
                            of <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> bases and other problems.<note n="16" xml:id="d82fn16">See <ref target="#d86">Document
                                86</ref>.</note> Certainly, however, if the Council agreed that
                            phase III—B of the <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName>
                            Committee timetable was likely to come earlier than 1958, then clearly
                            the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> must come to grips with the
                            issue of accelerating the programs for continental defense. When this
                            issue is thoroughly investigated, it may become clear that the main
                            problem is the specific timing of expenditures for continental defense,
                            rather than the amount of accumulating expenditure for continental
                            defense over a long period of years.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> concluded by stating
                            his desire strongly to emphasize the significance of the new civil
                            defense program. As he had suggested earlier, human resources may emerge
                            as the limiting factor on the ability of the United States to withstand
                            a Soviet nuclear attack. Despite this fact, the Council and the
                            Administration had never really come to grips with the problem of civil
                            defense. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> was sure
                            that <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5606 was sound in calling for
                            greater Federal emphasis and direction of the civil defense program. He
                            urged that the issue of civil defense be met by the Council head-on,
                            something which it had refused to do up to this point. Such a head-on
                            confrontation was, of course bound to have significant fiscal
                            implications.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President commented that from his reading of the Financial
                            Appendix to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5606, the programs in
                            which the rising costs were most notable for the future were in (1) the
                            area of civil defense and (2) defense against air vehicles. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> agreed with the Vice
                            President, but pointed out that the projected increase in civil defense
                            would occur only after the policy set forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5606 was agreed to by the Council and the President,
                            and not otherwise. By and large, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> said, he thought the civil defense program was
                            the single most important proposal in this new policy statement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ralph Spear then asked the Vice President’s permission to give to the
                            National Security Council the views of Governor <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName> on the civil defense program,
                            explaining that, unhappily, Governor <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName> was unable to be present himself. Mr. Spear
                            said that Governor <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName> felt
                            strongly, as did Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName>, he
                            judged, that this Administration had simply not come to grips with the
                            civil defense problem in the United States. All kinds of studies had
                            been made <pb xml:id="pg_326" n="326" facs="0350"/>within the Government
                            and outside. The results of nearly all of these studies agreed that a
                            stronger Federal role was essential if civil defense was ever to be at
                            all effective. With respect to the costly shelter program alluded to in
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5606, Mr. Spear pointed out that
                            existing law places on the Federal Civil Defense Administrator
                            responsibility for the development of measures to minimize casualties
                            and damage. Governor <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName> felt
                            that in this situation he had one of two major choices. On the one hand,
                            he could put reliance on measures to evacuate people from our cities or
                            to measures for dispersal. The other alternative was to provide shelter
                            against the weight of nuclear weapons. These were the two alternatives,
                            and certainly the present law contemplated some kind of shelter program,
                            the costs of which were to be shared by the Federal Government and the
                            States and municipalities. Unhappily, however, it had never been
                            possible to get appropriations, up to now, for such a shelter program.
                            Moreover, as we now look ahead to the period when intercontinental
                            ballistic missiles might be employed, and when warning time would be a
                            matter of only a few minutes, it seemed foolish to put very much
                            reliance on measures of evacuation as opposed to the development of a
                            shelter program.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, said Mr. Spear, Governor <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName> did not feel that if the Council adopted <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5606, paragraph 24 of that paper would
                            give him carte blanche to start out on an extensive shelter program.
                            Such a shelter program would, of course, go through the normal budgetary
                            processes, just as did all other continental defense programs. Indeed
                            the estimate of the cost of the shelter program, as set forth in the
                            Financial Appendix to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5606, could be
                            described as so soft as to be virtually liquid. The truth of the matter
                            was that <gloss target="#t_FCDA1">FCDA</gloss> simply did not yet have
                            the basic figures on which to reach firm conclusions as to the probable
                            cost of a shelter program. For example, they did not know as yet how
                            much shelter was already available and at hand in many of our large
                            cities. Findings on this subject could, of course, greatly influence the
                            estimated cost figures for a shelter program. In point of fact, then,
                            all that we really have at the present time are the rough estimated
                            costs of beginning a shelter program; that is, Mr. Spear emphasized, the
                            total cost to be borne both by the States and by the Federal Government.
                            It could be that these total costs could reach ultimately a figure of
                            $20 billion. In conclusion, Mr. Spear repeated again that, regardless of
                            Council action on <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5606, Governor
                                <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName> would not regard such
                            action as giving him a green light to proceed on an elaborate shelter
                            program. He would, however, feel obliged to come up with a shelter
                            program which would thereafter be subject to the normal budgetary
                            process.</p>
                        <p>Acting Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> said that in the Department of Defense it was
                            felt that the approach of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5606, in
                            looking at the total continental defense program, was the wise approach.
                                <pb xml:id="pg_327" n="327" facs="0351"/>Moreover, he said, he
                            agreed with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>’s
                            point that other programs related to continental defense were bound
                            likewise to show large increases. An example of this was the program for
                            increasing the production of B–52 bombers. In regard to defense against
                            air vehicles, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> said that the work of the Defense Department
                            boiled down to three major areas: (1) provision of tactical warning of
                            attack; (2) ways and means of destroying attacking enemy planes; (3)
                            remedying the vulnerability of <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>. All
                            three of these areas, continued Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName>, were now the subject of intensive study and
                            work in the Defense Department. Even at this point in the study it had
                            become clear that costs in all these areas would end up being
                            substantially higher than originally estimated. Thus, originally it was
                            estimated that the Distant Early Warning line would cost $100 million.
                            It was now estimated that the <gloss target="#t_DEW1">DEW</gloss> line
                            would cost $400 million. In the face of facts such as these, the Defense
                            Department was making every conceivable effort to eliminate duplication.
                            Even so, we will have, predicted Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName>, very fundamental decisions to make in the
                            near future.</p>
                        <p>With respect to these comments of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName>, the Vice President observed that there was
                            now in the Congress very strong pressure for increased strength and
                            effectiveness of the nation’s retaliatory striking power. This pressure
                            came from both political parties. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> replied to the Vice President by stating that
                            the Defense Department felt that the current program for increasing our
                            retaliatory striking power was a sound program, in that it kept our
                            striking power in harmony and in step with the development of our
                            defenses against Soviet striking power.</p>
                        <p>At this point, Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> suggested that the Vice
                            President might wish to call on Mr. Robert Sprague, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Consultant on Continental Defense, who
                            had made valuable contributions to the Planning Board in the course of
                            the formulation of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5606.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> said that it seemed to
                            him that in analyzing this enormously complex problem of continental
                            defense, there was one point which struck home most forcibly. Both in
                            our basic national security policy, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            5602/1, and in this new proposed continental defense policy, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5606, there was an underlying
                            assumption from which everything else followed in logical sequence. This
                            was the assumption that, as of mid-1956, the United States would have
                            achieved the capability to launch a <hi rend="italic">decisive
                                attack</hi> on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Further in
                            the assumption was the estimate that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would be able by mid-1958, now up-dated to mid-1957,
                            to launch a <hi rend="italic">crippling attack</hi> on the United
                            States, though it was assumed that the United States would be able to
                            recover from such a crippling attack to the point of being able to
                            retaliate against the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and to
                            destroy it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> said that
                            as he understood our national policy and programs, there was little that
                                <pb xml:id="pg_328" n="328" facs="0352"/>we could do, in view of
                            Soviet capabilities, to prevent the killing of millions of our people if
                            the Soviet Union chose to launch an attack. We could, however, and it
                            was indeed our policy to preserve our massive retaliatory capability and
                            to be able to destroy the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> if the
                            latter should undertake to attack the United States.</p>
                        <p>This being the assumption underlying <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            5602/1 and <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5606, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> went on to emphasize his
                            conviction that if certain of our continental defense programs, as set
                            forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5606, were not promptly
                            accelerated, the assumption would no longer hold good and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would be in a position not merely to
                            launch a <hi rend="italic">crippling</hi> attack, but actually a <hi rend="italic">decisive</hi> attack, not later than mid-1958 and
                            possibly sooner. This was so vitally important that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> suggested a recognition of this
                            importance should be made by the inclusion of new language in both
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602/1 and <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5606. For this reason, he said, he had
                            written out what seemed to him appropriate language.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> went on to say that
                            while granting the fact of an increasing nuclear capability on the part
                            of the U.S. Navy, for instance, he was nevertheless sure that <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> was still the main reliance of the
                            United States in carrying out its basic policy of being able to launch a
                            massive retaliatory attack. Accordingly, the ability of <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> to retaliate must, above all other
                            things, be made secure. After this, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> read to the Council the proposed language
                            mentioned above, which he recommended should be included at the end of
                            paragraph 1 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5606. In general, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName>’s language stressed
                            the need to accelerate certain continental defense programs, because
                            otherwise the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> might be in a
                            position to launch a decisive attack on the United States as early as
                            mid-1958.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName>
                            commented on the vital importance that <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> be in a position to get the required percentage of
                                <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> planes off bases and in the air
                            within the estimated warning time of Russian attack. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> said that he did not know what
                            the required percentage was—whether 50% of the planes on the ground,
                            more or less. But in any case, enough must be got off the ground so that
                            they would not be destroyed and would be able to retaliate massively
                            against the Soviet Union. That a sufficient percentage of <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> planes could thus be got off the ground
                            within the estimated tactical warning time, was not likely under present
                            programs and schedules.</p>
                        <p>When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> had concluded his
                            observations, the Vice President said that his immediate reaction was to
                            invite the response of the Department of Defense. The Vice President
                            added that he understood that the Department of Defense would give its
                            reactions to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName>’s
                            recommendations in the course of next month.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_329" n="329" facs="0353"/>
                        <p>At this point, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>
                            inquired of Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> as to when the Council
                            might expect to obtain the reports of the so-called Prochnow Committee
                            dealing with anticipated expenditures by the United States on military
                            and economic assistance to certain foreign nations. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> pointed out that the Council
                            had now received a full report on the continental defense programs. It
                            would get status reports on all of our Defense Department policies as of
                            June 30 or shortly thereafter. However, we did not have the status
                            reports on foreign assistance, and until we got the whole picture the
                            magnitude of the whole national security problem would not be clear. He
                            then inquired of Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> when the Defense
                            Department status reports and the Prochnow Committee reports would come
                            to the Council for consideration.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> replied that the annual status reports
                            on the national security programs of the various departments and
                            agencies covering the period through June 30, 1956, would probably not
                            be available for Council consideration earlier than August or
                                September.<note n="17" xml:id="d82fn17">See <ref target="#d84">Documents 84</ref> and <ref target="#d85">85</ref>.</note> To
                            this information, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> responded by stating that piecemeal status
                            reports don’t do very much good. Even this present report on continental
                            defense, good as it was, wasn’t much use to the Council except as a
                            warning. Certainly these status reports wouldn’t be really effective
                            until all of them could be looked at together.</p>
                        <p>Agreeing with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>,
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> commented on the
                            necessity of speeding up Council consideration of all the status reports
                            on the national security programs. If the Council had to wait for all
                            these reports to come in until next September, this might be too late a
                            date for effective action in terms of the budgetary processes.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President likewise agreed on the need for a speed-up in the
                            receipt of these reports. He pointed out that if what the Council had
                            been hearing this morning was correct, a decision on the continental
                            defense policy of the United States certainly could not wait very long,
                            especially if the Council proposed to accelerate the development of
                            these continental defense programs.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> again inquired
                            why the Council could not get the status reports earlier than next
                            autumn. Could we not advance the cut-off date from June 30 to the
                            present time and thus hasten the compilation of the final returns?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> explained the great difficulties
                            involved in getting out the annual status reports and the three-year
                            cost projections. He was seconded by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName>, who explained to the
                            Council that the authorities in the Defense Department had just
                            presented him with their first “look-see” as to the prospects for the
                            Fiscal Year 1958 <pb xml:id="pg_330" n="330" facs="0354"/>Defense
                            Department budget. Although this look-see was in a very preliminary
                            stage, a very great rise in expenditures, even greater than the Joint
                            Chiefs of Staff had estimated, seemed to be in the cards.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> commented that
                            the Financial Appendix to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5606
                            indicated a rise in costs for continental defense from about $3 billion
                            currently to approximately $11 billion in 1960. If this was the
                            situation in continental defense, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> deduced that the total expenditures for the
                            Department of Defense would probably rise from their current $40 billion
                            a year to $60 billion or $80 billion in 1960 and thereafter. If anything
                            like this really happened, the Administration would be faced with the
                            gravest problems. The approach of the Administration to such problems,
                            combined with achieving understanding of them by the American people,
                            would be a tremendous undertaking. Accordingly, he repeated that at the
                            very earliest possible date the Council must become aware of the trends
                            of where our policies for national defense were going to lead us.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> expressed the
                            feeling that there was no particular need to await all the details of
                            the June 30 status reports in order for the Council to be in a position
                            to tackle the problem just mentioned by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>. In broad terms, at least, the
                            relevant figures could be presented to the Council much sooner than next
                            fall. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said
                            that that was essentially what we needed and what he believed was
                            possible. <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> went
                            on to comment in the same vein that essentially he had heard nothing new
                            about the situation in the course of the Council’s deliberations on
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5606. He had anticipated
                            everything that the Council had been listening to this morning about the
                            magnitude of the problem. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> agreed with <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName>, but stressed the fact that it was
                            important to get the conclusions on paper so that we could see where to
                            go.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> commented that
                            the Administration was currently carrying out in the military field a
                            number of concepts, strategies, and preparations which were no longer
                            valid, although they had been valid when first undertaken five or six
                            year ago. Five years ago we had all believed that the first line of
                            defense of the United States lay in Western Europe. Now, with what we
                            know about the nuclear capabilities of the Soviet Union, we have come to
                            feel that our front line is in our massive retaliatory capability and in
                            the stability of the American economy. The situation currently in the
                            air is a very different situation from that which existed five years
                            ago. This indicates that we should contemplate a major shift in the
                            emphasis of our programs and, accordingly, in our allocation of our
                            resources for defense. We do not have to wait for the returns of the
                            status reports to realize that we simply cannot carry out all of our
                            military programs, both those that were valid five years ago and those
                            that we deem valid now, without facing an absolutely impossible
                            financial burden.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_331" n="331" facs="0355"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that
                            Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> had put his
                            finger on the essence of the problem. He again called for getting all
                            the facts and figures together so that the Council could decide on what
                            we could continue to do and what we could not do. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> said he believed that the
                            requirements called for by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> could be provided at least before August.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> concurred in
                            this opinion of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> said that he wished
                            to be sure that these figures were to include all national security
                            programs and not merely those national security programs for which the
                            Department of Defense was responsible. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that this was indeed the
                            case, and called on Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> to get all this
                            material together as soon as possible and present it to the National
                            Security Council.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> intervened to
                            express his agreement with the points made by Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> in arguing that we have been
                            following both old outmoded concepts of getting ready for a possible
                            future war, as well as new and more valid ones. He also agreed that such
                            a dual course of action was impossible.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> pointed out that
                            when the results of the three-year projections of the costs of all
                            national security programs has been put together and brought before the
                            Council, these reports should have included in them the factors
                            reflecting the growth of the U.S. economy and national income over the
                            next three years. Otherwise the forthcoming reports would not be
                            all-inclusive. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>
                            indicated his agreement with this suggestion, but pointed out that the
                            rate of the growth of our economy and our national income had been much
                            slower than the rate of our expenditures for national security.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President observed that it was all very well for the members of
                            the National Security Council to discuss here what we should do and
                            should not do with respect to getting rid of outmoded military concepts.
                            On the other hand, the Secretary of State may well have something to say
                            about what is feasible and what is not feasible from a political point
                            of view with respect to dumping old concepts and defense strategies.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> then expressed the
                            hope that all these figures which the Council had been calling for could
                            be got together in perhaps thirty days. Thereafter he recommended that
                            the National Security Council have a two or three-day meeting to
                            consider all the implications of these figures.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> then suggested an appropriate form of
                            Council action on <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5606. He pointed
                            out that <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5606 contained an estimated
                            three-year projection of the costs of the continental defense policies
                            that were recommended. He went on to say that the Council could and
                            would obtain similar three-year projections for all the other national
                            security programs by next month. Thus all the cost elements <pb xml:id="pg_332" n="332" facs="0356"/>could be brought together in a
                            single paper by late July. This being the case, Mr.
                                <persName>Anderson</persName> recommended that the National Security
                            Council postpone any action on <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5606
                            until this date.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President said that this seemed suitable to him if there were no
                            objections from other members of the Council. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> interjected the hope that by
                            this time the Federal Civil Defense Administration could have priced out
                            more firmly the probable costs of its proposed shelter program.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President then went on to suggest that the Council might now set
                            a target date for its meeting on the status reports on the national
                            security programs. He pointed out that certainly the President himself
                            should be on hand when the Council considered matters of such great
                            significance. Accordingly, the Vice President suggested that this
                            problem be scheduled on the agenda of the National Security Council for
                            the first meeting at which the President would be available to preside.
                            This he thought might well be some time around July 15 or 20.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> said that he had
                            one last thought to express before the Council finished its discussion.
                            He referred to paragraph 26 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5606,
                            which dealt with the problem of public education and participation in
                            the continental defense effort. He invited the Planning Board to
                            consider the kind of education the U.S. public should have— namely, to
                            be convinced that whatever kind of attack would be made against the
                            United States, the United States would survive the attack, win the war,
                            and rebuild from the ruins. In short, we must instill courage and belief
                            in victory in our people. We must exercise leadership. The people of the
                            United States must know that their leaders are convinced that the
                            country will come through any ordeal that it may be called upon to
                            face.</p>

                            preservation of U.S. overseas military bases, operating rights, and
                            facilities.</p>

                            this problem with him at an appropriate time, and am sending you the
                            attached memorandum in advance to indicate the nature of the problem as
                            I see it. I would, of course, wish to have you present when I <pb xml:id="pg_334" n="334" facs="0358"/>raise this matter with the
                            President. I will get in touch with you when I ask for the appointment
                            to see him.<note n="2" xml:id="d83fn2">According to a memorandum of

                        <p>Throughout the world, we are faced with political developments which
                            threaten the continuance of many U.S. overseas military bases, operating
                            rights, and facilities in friendly and allied countries. In Iceland and
                            Saudi Arabia, our existing base rights are in jeopardy. In Morocco, and
                            to a somewhat lesser extent in the Azores, we are faced with difficult
                            negotiations whose outcome is uncertain. In the Philippines and Okinawa,
                            local opposition in some aspects of our overseas base programs has
                            become so outspoken that the maintenance of our existing facilities is
                            becoming a major internal political issue. In Thailand, criticism is
                            beginning to mount, led by opposition elements. Even in Spain there are
                            signs of possible trouble. Our British allies have already suffered from
                            the general change of attitude and are faced with the loss of their
                            existing bases and military rights in Ceylon and with major
                            complications in Cyprus and Singapore.</p>

                            of the Future.</p>

                            and facilities overseas stemmed from the Stalinist post-war policy of
                            the use of force and the threat of violence (insurrection in Greece,
                            absorption of European satellites, division of Germany, Berlin blockade,
                            Communist-led uprisings in Vietnam and the Philippines, <pb xml:id="pg_335" n="335" facs="0359"/>armed aggression in Korea,
                            etc.). Our present overseas system largely developed following the
                            aggression in Korea which caused a psychosis of fear in many free
                            nations which did not alone have the capacity to defend themselves. They
                            therefore welcomed the added protection which they received as a result
                            of granting to the U.S. military rights and facilities which would serve
                            to deter Communist attack or to protect them in the event of Communist
                            aggression. The general pattern of cooperation from host countries that
                            sought U.S. protection facilicated acquisition of base rights on
                            reasonable terms, even from countries whose primary interest was in
                            securing a financial quid pro quo (such as Saudi Arabia and Libya).</p>
                        <p>However, in the past eighteen months: (a) as a result of the major change
                            in Soviet tactics, the general impression has been created that the
                            danger of aggression and war has very substantially receded; (b) growth
                            of nuclear capabilities has incited fear that U.S. bases may be a
                            primary object of Soviet nuclear attack, with “fall-out” which would
                            wipe out the surrounding population; (c) the Soviets have been stressing
                            that they wish to help countries solve their economic problems, that
                            there are no political strings attached, and that they do not want any
                            military bases or rights because these are an infringement on
                            sovereignty but that they are willing to supply military equipment
                            without strings or conditions attached; (d) there has been everywhere a
                            growing spirit of nationalism which in many instances regards the
                            granting of military rights and facilities as a derogation of national
                            sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>The above factors, together with natural frictions and jealousies on the
                            part of local populations which are inevitable where substantial numbers
                            of foreign troops are stationed for a long time within a country, have
                            combined to sharpen local opposition to U.S. military operating rights
                            and facilities overseas, even by non-Communist elements and to make them
                            internal political issues.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. The Necessity for U.S. Flexibility of Approach
                            in Modifying Existing Programs.</p>
                        <p>To summarize, a strong tide is running against our present foreign base
                            positions. If they are not to be engulfed by this tide, if we are to
                            preserve our vitally important existing facilities but also prevent
                            present allies from becoming hostile or neutral, we must be prepared to
                            consider modifying some of our existing arrangements and procedures with
                            respect to overseas bases and rights, and bringing them into keeping
                            with the political and psychological realities of today and tomorrow. As
                            history has proved with respect to the overseas positions of both the
                            French and the British (Indochina, North Africa, Cyprus, etc.), we would
                            not be able to maintain our existing facilities with a friendly
                            enviroment if we wait until the pressures against them <pb xml:id="pg_336" n="336" facs="0360"/>have become so great that
                            nothing but total ejection will meet the local demands. We must assess
                            the situation in the different countries most carefully and consider
                            whether modifications should not, in some cases, be made to anticipate a
                            time when irresistible pressures are built</p>
                        <p>It seems evident that if we are incapable of being flexible in the face
                            of changing local conditions, we will create difficulties and will
                            undermine local governments and political elements which are friendly to
                            the U.S. It therefore seems imperative, in the interest not only of
                            maintaining to the maximum extent possible our existing rights and
                            facilities so as to deter Communist aggression but also in the
                            overriding interest of preserving the position of U.S. leadership in the
                            effort for free world unity, that we promptly re-examine our present
                            program.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. The Need to Develop the Idea of Common
                            Interest and to Eliminate Symbols Interpreted as a Derogation of
                            National Sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>We must find effective ways practically to demonstrate, through actual
                            handling of U.S. overseas military facilities, that they are important
                            elements of collective security for deterring aggression, and that the
                            local people concerned have a full and mutual interest in the
                            enterprise. Where this is done in Europe, with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, our bases are least under fire. We have had some
                            success in developing a feeling of a collective and cooperative effort
                            for a common end. We should begin now to explore what lines of action we
                            can follow which will, with least sacrifice of military utility,
                            increase the local sense of participation and self-interest in our other
                            overseas military operations. In other words, we must develop the
                            feeling that U.S. military rights and facilities are part of the
                            security system of the host country. The sense of common interest will
                            be valuable even in countries where local interest is primarily focused
                            on financial returns from U.S. bases. In other host countries, it will
                            be invaluable.</p>

                            have military bases, operating rights, and facilities. The study should
                            include for each place:</p>

                        <p>ii. the procedures which have been applied by the U.S. military in terms

                            first was a further report on measures designed to lessen the

                            Whereas the Technological Capabilities Panel report (<persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> report) was concerned
                            primarily with <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> physical
                            vulnerability, the Air Force has directed its recently completed study
                            to the entire vulnerability problem of increasing the deterrent and
                            strike capability of <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>, including
                            offensive as well as defensive measures necessary to enhance <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>’s capability.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_339" n="339" facs="0363"/>
                        <p>General Lindsay’s briefing was in three parts: (1) Major vulnerability
                            areas and remedial actions; (2) remedial actions requiring further study
                            and research; and (3) Air Force program objectives which are being
                            recommended to increase <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>’s deterrent
                            capability and strike potential.</p>
                        <p>General Lindsay emphasized that the program objectives which he would
                            discuss have not been related to budgetary considerations. He noted that
                            practical considerations dictated that caution be exercised in embarking
                            on a program which, while greatly improving our posture in one area, may
                            limit our ability to maintain an equally strong posture in other equally
                            important areas. He emphasized that the magnitude of the program
                            objectives being discussed represented the minimum actions proposed by
                            the Air Force.</p>
                        <p>As to <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> vulnerability considerations,
                            General Lindsay listed the following areas of vulnerability and
                            commented on each along the lines indicated below:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">
                                <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>’s Base Structure:</hi> At
                            present many <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> bases have two assigned
                            wings and are jammed with as many as 130 aircraft which create
                            operational problems and present highly profitable targets to the enemy.
                            Several <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> units are located in coastal
                            areas where the amount of warning time would be insufficient to get the
                            majority of the craft into the air before an enemy attack. To reduce
                            this vulnerability the Air Force has embarked on a program to disperse
                            to a maximum of one medium wing per base and a maximum of one heavy
                            squadron per base plus their associated tankers. Although the Air Force
                            does not propose to evacuate coastal <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>
                            locations, it plans to progressively reduce congestion at those bases
                            and to locate new <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> units in the
                            central United States. The Air Force is examining the possible use of
                            Canadian bases to support tanker refueling operations since this would
                            improve <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>’s strike capability, enhance
                            its target coverage, reduce reaction time and increase the number of
                            weapons which could be delivered on the initial strike wave. Only a
                            minimum caretaker type force would be assigned to those Canadian bases.
                            Tankers would not actually be assigned; instead such bases would be used
                            for exercise and emergency purposes only. To increase flexibility in
                                <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> operations the Air Force is now
                            studying the possible use of additional compatible non-<gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> bases which may be required on and
                            after D-day. There are 272 such bases in the continental United States
                            capable of supporting <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> regrouping
                            operations, and by 1960 there will be 75 similar bases overseas.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Warning Time:</hi> Warning time is the next most
                            vulnerable area, according to General Lindsay. He indicated that since
                            it was not prudent to plan on strategic warning, Air Force planning for
                            the future is based on the relatively limited warning to be obtained
                            from our radar network. To increase tactical warning time, improvements
                            must be made in the capability of the continental warning perimeter.
                            This requires more gap-filler radars for low altitude coverage, as well
                            as an enhanced ground observer corps. Since the enemy can effectively
                            end-run the <gloss target="#t_DEW1">DEW</gloss> line extension in the
                            Pacific and attack from the south, two possible countermeasures are
                            being considered: (a) A further extension <pb xml:id="pg_340" n="340" facs="0364"/>of the <gloss target="#t_DEW1">DEW</gloss> line south
                            of midway (this is now being studied by the Joint Chiefs of Staff); and
                            (b) a southern radar net somewhat in the nature of the <gloss target="#t_DEW1">DEW</gloss> line type of operation in the
                            north.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">
                                <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> Response:</hi> General Lindsay
                            indicated that an alert force is the best means to enable <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> to mount a significant initial
                            retaliatory strike. This alert force concept is being studied now.
                            Although one-third of the force on alert would be desirable,
                            considerably less than that appears to be the best that can be attained.
                            In addition, said General Lindsay, we must speed the decision-making
                            process by which warning information is converted into action by the
                                <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> forces. To achieve this, greater
                            coordination between <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CONAD1">CONAD</gloss> is required.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">
                                <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>’s Control and Communications
                                Capacity:</hi>
                            <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>’s control and communications is the
                            next most vulnerable area, according to General Lindsay. A more
                            comprehensive communications net is required. In addition, the Air Force
                            is considering better protected control rooms, protected alternate
                            headquarters, and a radiation monitoring system as well as a bomb impact
                            location system.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">The <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                                Threat:</hi> The <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> threat has
                            also been considered in terms of <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>
                            vulnerability, leading to the Air Force’s belief that protective shelter
                            may offer a considerable defense against this threat. An evaluation of
                            the cost and effectiveness of protective shelters in the higher blast
                            resistant ranges will be available about September 1, 1956, according to
                            General Lindsay.</p>
                        <p>6. As to the <hi rend="italic">vulnerability of the weapons
                                stockpile</hi>, all of <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>’s
                            weapons, as of the planned distribution for January 1, 1957, will be in
                            relatively few sites, and over 50% will be located at only 13 sites. Of
                            the total of 45 weapons sites, 38 will be on <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> bases, which are expected to be primary aiming points.
                            A thorough evaluation of the stockpile vulnerability problem is an
                            urgent requirement, and action is being initiated to cause this
                            evaluation and to determine the additional actions deemed necessary.</p>
                        <p>General Lindsay next listed the following items requiring further study:
                            (a) a southern radar net; (b) the extension of the southwest flank of
                            the <gloss target="#t_DEW1">DEW</gloss> line; (c) protected control
                            rooms and protected alternate headquarters; (d) <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> requirements for use of compatible non-<gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> bases; (e) the need for a radiation
                            monitoring system.</p>
                        <p>General Lindsay next dealt with Air Force program objectives, emphasizing
                            again that while the listed requirements are considered valid, the cost
                            estimates to which he would make reference have not been related to
                            budgetary considerations. (These estimates are contained in the chart
                            which is filed in the minutes of the meeting and which is a copy of the
                            chart which General Lindsay utilized in briefing the Council.<note n="5" xml:id="d85fn5">The chart is not filed in the minutes.</note>) The
                            highlights of this portion of General Lindsay’s briefing follow:</p>
                        <p>1. As to <hi rend="italic">dispersal of the <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> forces</hi>, $168 million have been provided for
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957 to carry out the initial
                            increment of the dispersal program with the objective of stationing a
                            maximum of one medium <pb xml:id="pg_341" n="341" facs="0365"/>wing and
                            their associated tankers per base and one heavy squadron and their
                            associated tankers per base. For <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958
                            the Air Force proposes a $340 million expenditure as the second
                            increment to obtain dispersal of the <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>
                            force. This would provide 31 heavy squadron bases and 20 medium wing
                            bases.</p>
                        <p>2. As to <hi rend="italic">improvement of the continental warning
                                perimeter</hi>, there is involved a total package cost of $33
                            million through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962, which funds
                            would be used primarily for additional gap-filler radars.</p>
                        <p>3. As to <hi rend="italic">speeding the decision-making process</hi>, the
                            estimated cost is $2 million through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1962, which funds would be used primarily for additional communications
                            facilities between <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> and ADC.</p>
                        <p>4. As to the <hi rend="italic">alert force concept</hi>, the Air Force is
                            proposing an expenditure of $50 million in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 as the initial increment for construction of the
                            unique facilities necessary for alert operations, e.g., parking aprons,
                            alert hangers, taxi ramps located adjacent to the take-off end of
                            runways, etc.. Initial and annual operating costs for subsequent years
                            are also reflected on the above-mentioned chart.</p>
                        <p>5. As to <hi rend="italic">increased control and communications
                                capacity</hi>, the funds set up as a program objective by the Air
                            Force include $2.9 million in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 and
                            $2.9 million in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959 for the purchase
                            of necessary security equipment.</p>
                        <p>6. As to <hi rend="italic">Canadian tanker support bases</hi>, the cost
                            for initial construction is $28 million for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957. In addition, $122 million would be required to
                            complete the program.</p>
                        <p>7. As to <hi rend="italic">research on protective shelters</hi>, such
                            research is urgently needed in view of the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> threat. Accordingly, the Air Force contemplates use of
                            about $10 million for research and testing in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957.</p>
                        <p>8. As to <hi rend="italic">reduction of the vulnerability of the atomic
                                weapons stockpile</hi>, estimates are not available at this time. As
                            a by-product of the <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> base dispersal
                            program, some reduction in stockpile vulnerability will be achieved;
                            however, further study of the problem by the Air Force and the Atomic
                            Energy Commission is warranted on a priority basis.</p>
                        <p>General Lindsay concluded his formal presentation with the observation
                            that considerably more money could be profitably spent in the areas
                            mentioned above; that continued analysis of these problems will be made
                            in the light of future estimates of Soviet capabilities in order to
                            determine what changes or additions may be necessary to reduce <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> vulnerability.</p>
                        <p>There was no Council discussion following this portion of the continental
                            defense presentation.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName> advised the
                            Council that the second item on today’s agenda involved a briefing by
                            the Department of Defense on two separate aspects of continental
                            defense: (a) The Atlantic and Pacific seaward extensions of the early
                            warning line, and (b) the early warning and control radars.<note n="10" xml:id="d85fn10">According to the August 7 memorandum from Stelle to
                                Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> (see <ref target="#d85fn4">footnote 4</ref> above) this briefing was
                                intended to be part of the background for the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> review of the estimated 3-year
                                projections of all national security programs. Stelle added that the
                                Department of Defense review of these programs was in response to
                                the views expressed by Robert Sprague, questioning the adequacy of
                                specific programs to maintain <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>’s
                                operational readiness. According to Stelle, <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> believed that “Soviet
                                nuclear capabilities are already at a level and are continuing to
                                develop at a rate that the period from mid-1956 to mid-1958 may be
                                as critical for the US as the period from mid-1958 on, when the
                                Soviets may achieve decisive capabilities. Hence he has urged the
                                immediate acceleration of certain continental defense programs
                                designed to preserve <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>’s
                                retaliatory capability by extending the period of tactical warning.”
                                Stelle also stated that the discussion of the Atlantic extension of
                                the early warning line might invite questions on the subject of
                                defense installations in Iceland, and the negotiations on base
                                rights in the Azores. He attached status memoranda on these two
                                items to his memorandum. (Department of State, <gloss target="#t_SS1">S/S</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>

                                Series)</note> He advised that the date of completion of programmed
                            improvements in these aspects of continental defense related to the
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> Timetable studies
                            and in addition, that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName>’s recommendations on these two aspects has been
                            taken into account by the Department of Defense. General Lindsay
                            thereupon introduced the Defense briefers, Lt. Col. George S. Weart,
                                <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>, and Commander W.G. Boyer,
                                <gloss target="#t_USN1">USN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Weart briefed the Council on the Air Force aspects of these two
                            programs, and Commander Boyer on the Navy aspects thereof. Their
                            briefings were substantially identical with the briefings given the
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning Board by the Department
                            of Defense on March 15, 1956.</p>
                        <p>In summary, Colonel Weart very briefly treated of each of the early
                            warning lines, their capabilities and operational readiness dates. He
                            singled out those areas where, by June 30, 1958, there will be a
                            detection capability of upwards of 60,000 feet and those remaining areas
                            where there will be a 40,000-foot detection capability. He indicated <pb xml:id="pg_343" n="343" facs="0367"/>that by July 1957 the
                            mid-Canada line and its previously planned extensions will be fully
                            operational; that the planned <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> line
                            was scheduled to be fully operational by the end of calendar year 1958;
                            that an extension of the <gloss target="#t_DEW1">DEW</gloss> line was
                            now planned across Greenland, and that in 1960 it is planned that the
                            early warning line from Argentia to the Azores will swing northward to
                            Greenland, from Greenland to the Faroe Islands, and thence tie into the
                            British radar system. He indicated that the North American Air Defense
                            System will have a 65,000-foot detection capability by June 30,
                            1958.</p>
                        <p>In summary, Commander Boyer indicated that the Navy portion of this
                            program called for five picket ship stations with supporting aircraft,
                            radar equipment, etc., off each coast; that YAGRs and DERs are to be
                            used for this purpose; that the entire YAGR–DER program would be
                            completed by July 1, 1958; and that by July 1, 1957 the interim seaward
                            line to the Azores would be fully operational, swinging northward later
                            as indicated by Colonel Weart. He advised that the Navy portion of this
                            program would provide some detection coverage up to 100,000 feet; that
                            most of it would permit detection up to 70,000 feet, and that the
                            minimum detection altitude would be at least 60,000 feet.</p>
                        <p>On the completion of the formal presentation on this subject by Colonel
                            Weart and Commander Boyer, the Secretary of State observed that these
                            briefings illustrated the great interdependence of our military and
                            foreign policies—a factor which was not always recognized, particularly
                            by some committees of the Congress. Indicative of such interdependence
                            was the problem of negotiating for extension of base rights in the
                            Azores in support of such things as the Atlantic air early warning
                            barrier. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> noted
                            that, when it was thought that Nehru would visit the United States,
                            these negotiations were suspended so as not to conflict with the Goa
                            situation. These negotiations were being held up again by the Portuguese
                            pending completion of the visit of the Chief Justice to India. In view
                            of the nature of Justice Warren’s visit, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he could not appreciate
                            fully the reasons cited for the stand taken by the Portuguese.
                            Nonetheless, he believed this did illustrate the sensitivity of the
                            Portuguese to such matters, as well as the interdependence of military
                            and foreign affairs operations. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> thought that in this respect the Canadian
                            situation was much better, although the continental defense interests of
                            the United States in Canada also involved related questions which were
                            not always appreciated, particularly when such questions were handled
                            separately by separate committees of the Congress which did not see such
                            questions in their over-all context.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he didn’t
                            know what could be done about the situation to which he referred, but he
                            did note that some of the assumptions on which military program
                            objectives were based, as <pb xml:id="pg_344" n="344" facs="0368"/>reflected by the briefings today, were complicated by economic,
                            political, and other factors such as those previously cited by him.
                            Being the Cabinet Member primarily responsible for foreign relations,
                            the Secretary of State said he thought that he should make mention of
                            these factors which consistently threatened efforts to accomplish
                            objectives of a politico-military nature.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that the
                            Department of Defense was keenly conscious of the points made by
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>. In addition,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he was also
                            conscious of the fact that we had never before in our history had
                            problems of the kind we were trying to cope with today. With thousands
                            of our military and other personnel spread throughout the world, we had
                            the problem of making our people realize that they were guests in these
                            host countries. If we looked at our problems in a piecemeal way, he
                            said, rather than in the proper perspective, we might become like the
                            guest who overstayed his welcome. Accordingly, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> thought we must look at all of
                            our overseas problems in this light and in a very broad way.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> indicated that
                            since such matters have worldwide repercussions, the Department of State
                            had been looking at these problems in terms of running our overseas
                            installations in a more austere fashion so that we might be able to
                            remain in them longer.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> observed that
                            Americans overseas don’t mean to be offensive, but around the globe we
                            acted as though the world was our oyster. This, he thought, was well
                            illustrated by the story of the Britisher who, in commenting on this
                            subject to an American in London, observed that “you are overpaid,
                            you’re overdressed, you’re oversexed, and most of all, you’re over
                            here.”</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, addressing
                            himself to the Director of Central Intelligence, observed that we had
                            indications that the Soviets now have radars with a 70,000-foot
                            capability. He wondered, based on the briefings at today’s meeting, if
                            this meant that we were behind the Soviets in this field.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> confirmed that
                            the Soviets do have a 70,000-foot radar capability. Since he was not an
                            expert on our own radar capability, however, Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> thought that aspect of the question
                            could better be answered by the Department of Defense.</p>
                        <p>General Lindsay commented at this point that he didn’t think one could
                            say the Russians have a complete 70,000-foot radar detection system in
                            effect now. He said the Soviet’s 70,000-foot detection capability was
                            spotty, as was our own.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he had the
                            impression that the Soviets now had a detection capability of 70,000
                            feet and that the United States did not have the same capability at this
                            time.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_345" n="345" facs="0369"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> noted that while
                            he favored technical improvements in these areas, he believed another
                            major problem entailed the human factor. Citing such examples as the
                            recent ship collision off the Jersey coast, he noted that a wreck
                            resulted despite the fact that the vessels had radar equipment. This
                            illustrated to him the need not only for technical equipment but also
                            for alert humans who had a grasp of their job and an appreciation of the
                            need for thinking while on the job.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> introduced Items 1 and 2 together. He
                            said that the presentations today and tomorrow were designed to give the
                            Council the clearest possible view of the annual cost and projected
                            trend, over the next three years, of programs developed in the
                            departments to carry out the objectives in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602/1<note n="4" xml:id="d86fn4">
                                <ref target="#d66">Document 66</ref>.</note> and in related <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> papers. He recalled that on June 4 the
                            President had directed that the annual status reports include an
                            estimated projection of each program, through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959, deemed appropriate to meet approved national
                            security objectives. Thus each agency has described what it believes to
                            be necessary to carry out its particular policy objective; but the total
                            requirement for all these programs had not heretofore been matched
                            against total resources available.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> also recalled that the President
                            requested Treasury and Budget, on the basis of agency figures, to
                            prepare a report on the entire fiscal and budgetary outlook through
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959, to enable the Council to
                            reappraise the emphasis to be given the various elements of national
                            strategy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> noted that on June 15 the Council had
                            considered a proposed continental defense policy (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5606) which would have involved raising
                            the current annual expenditure of $3 billion to nearly $12 billion by
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1960. The Council had deferred
                            action on continental defense pending consideration of the 3-year
                            projections of all national security programs without awaiting the Fall
                            status reports.<note n="5" xml:id="d86fn5">See <ref target="#d82">Document 82</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> said that the 3-year projections were
                            embodied in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5609, except for the
                            military program, which would be presented orally. Today all programs
                            except the mutual security and military would be presented in order in
                            which they appeared in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5609.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> noted that <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5609 was not accompanied by Planning Board
                            recommendations. It was thought that Council discussion of the
                            presentations would be guidance for such future review of policies and
                            relative emphasis as might be directed in the light of the
                            presentations. Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> then called on the
                            Director, Bureau of the Budget, for the first presentation.</p>
                        <p>The Director, Bureau of the Budget, presented the fiscal and budgetary
                            outlook through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959.</p>
                        <p>The President noted that the Director had indicated that the military
                            figures used in his presentation had not been screened by the Secretary
                            of Defense. The President said the cart was before the horse, and
                            wondered why it should be necessary for the National Security Council to
                            go over estimates which the Secretary of Defense had not screened. Mr.
                                <persName>Anderson</persName> said that this meeting had been called
                            so that subsequent steps in preparing national security programs could
                            be <pb xml:id="pg_347" n="347" facs="0371"/>related to the guidance
                            which would be forthcoming in the discussion here. This guidance would
                            indicate the relative emphasis to be placed on various programs before
                            the estimates were in final form. The President wondered whether such
                            guidance could be forthcoming until the Secretary of Defense had
                            coordinated the military estimates. He said there must be some
                            duplication in the estimates submitted by the Services. Mr.
                                <persName>Anderson</persName> said that programs developed in the
                            Services are related to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> objectives,
                            and pointed out that a breakdown would show not only the Service
                            estimates, but the areas and functions to which the programs were
                            related. Thus the further steps to be taken in programming could take
                            into account the President’s broad concepts of national strategy
                            indicated in the light of the current trends and estimates.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> felt it would
                            be useful to consider the broad trend of expenditures. A proposed
                            increase of $10 billion based on present programs would seem to indicate
                            that it was time for the Council to realize that the fiscal trend
                            following the adoption of national security programs was always upward.
                            This group, he said, advises the President.———<note n="6" xml:id="d86fn6">As on the source text. Presumably Boggs did not hear
                                    <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>’s
                                comments.</note> The President, interrupting, said that the Council
                            did not advise him as to whether we should buy a new aircraft carrier or
                            a new airfield. Yet the Service estimates might include both.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> noted that the presentations on today’s
                            agenda had been called for as a result of the Council’s consideration of
                            the continental defense paper. The $12 billion figure in the latter
                            paper was the basis for the Council’s decision on June 15 to consider
                            3-year projections in the Council on all programs related to national
                            security objectives before acting on the continental defense paper.</p>
                        <p>The President said that as far as the Council was concerned there were
                            not three Defense Departments, but only one. He still wondered why the
                            Council should tackle the Service estimates.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that basic
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> policies were pushing us into
                            this kind of thing. He felt that these policies needed review.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he had
                            earlier in the week raised the question whether a Council meeting on
                            this subject was necessary, because Defense had little more to present
                            than it had presented previously.</p>
                        <p>The President said that earlier presentations by Defense had made it
                            clear that the cost of everything was increasing. He said that every
                            time a paper came up containing a proposed expenditure figure, such as
                            $54 billion, the figure could later be quoted, and any reduction of the
                            figure could be interpreted as a cut in national defense. He added <pb xml:id="pg_348" n="348" facs="0372"/>that our military strength must
                            be related to our economic strength, so that our national security
                            programs can be continued for as long as necessary. But the question is,
                            where do we get the money?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> felt that it
                            was pertinent to examine what the basic policy papers require. He said a
                            $10 billion increase in expenditures was obviously impossible, and a $2
                            billion increase was equally impossible. The expenditure trend was in
                            the wrong direction; it should be down and not up. If expenditures
                            increased he would have to resist proposals for tax reduction. If taxes
                            were reduced, the reduction might be cancelled out two years hence by
                            tax increases. The basic problem is: Should we follow the trend of
                            taking on every program, or should we go back to the “new look” of three
                            years ago, when the basis of our security was thought to be the
                            deterrent striking power of the Air Force? All that an expenditure of
                            $44 or $54 billion for national security buys is a one-year deterrent to
                            war. At the end of each year we have to start over and buy another
                            year’s deterrent; in effect, last year’s expenditure goes on the scrap
                            heap. Our expenditures for national security each year are about equal
                            to the assets of 25 of the largest corporations in the United States.
                            These corporations, with assets of $54.6 billion, produce 95% of the
                            country’s autos, half its steel, 82% of its telecommunications, 75% of
                            its heavy electrical equipment, half of its freight car movements, and
                            35% of its agricultural machinery, and include also the New York,
                            Chicago and Pacific Coast utility companies.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> felt we could
                            not spend $44 to $54 billion every year over a period of years for
                            unproductive purposes without destroying our economic system. If the
                            Council did not effect some reductions, the Soviets might be able to
                            defeat us without firing a shot, because our economy will suffer a
                            depression. He felt that we had been led astray in matters of national
                            security by scientists and by vested interests—military, political and
                            business vested interests. Since it is difficult to make a big saving in
                            any one year, we must start making savings immediately and get the job
                            done by small bites. If expenditures were reduced to $42 or $38 billion
                            while economic activity is increasing, then we could reduce taxes and
                            absorb the consequences.</p>
                        <p>The President said we had a few very basic policies. For example, we
                            wanted to retain our retaliatory power as a deterrent; we wanted to have
                            a good continental defense as part of the deterrent; we wanted to
                            support the military strength of our allies in Western Europe and Asia;
                            and we wanted to ensure that friendly nations were able to make a
                            living. If you eliminated these policies, he said, where would you be?
                            The <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> establishes these basic
                            policies, but does not say how much or what it will take to carry them
                            out. However, we have to do some of these basic things or cease to
                            exist. What we want to do is find a <pb xml:id="pg_349" n="349" facs="0373"/>Spartan way to carry out our policies. The President
                            said that the proper <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> decision should
                            be on the character of the defense we need. It was then the job of the
                            Department of Defense to tell us what gadgets we should have for that
                            kind of defense. He did not know how much reduction the Secretary of
                            Defense could effect in defense expenditures; until this was known, the
                            Council had insufficient data on which to base conclusions.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he wished to
                            mention a number of points: (1) We have not changed our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> commitments; (2) the rate at which we
                            build up is important, because “speed-up” programs cost more; (3) the
                            new look policy has not been clarified or completely accepted by the
                            Army. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he
                            received incredible estimates from the Services, and that the civilian
                            Secretaries wanted to leave him “holding the bag”. He added that force
                            levels should be considered also. A study had been made concerning the
                            possible reduction of 800,000 men, and this had leaked out.</p>
                        <p>In connection with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s first point, the President said he would change
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> commitments if necessary, but
                            so far he had wanted to avoid undercutting <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>. In regard to the third point, he thought
                            probably the Navy hadn’t fully accepted the new look policy either. As
                            far as the 800,000-man reduction was concerned, the President wondered
                            whether it was wrong to hope that the forces would eventually total 2.5
                            million.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said it was not
                            wrong to hope for a 2.5 million-man force, but no great reduction of
                            800,000 at one time was possible.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether the Services should prepare programs based on
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> decisions in Puerto Rico.<note n="7" xml:id="d86fn7">Regarding the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> decisions in Puerto Rico, see <ref target="#d64">Documents 64</ref>, <ref target="#d65">65</ref>, and <ref target="#d73">73</ref>.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> said this had
                            been done. The President said he understood that under the Puerto Rico
                            program we would be spending $38 to $40 billion on defense. Now the
                            Services seemed to be saying that we should be spending $48 billion.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he had
                            suggested to the Joint Chiefs of Staff that their Puerto Rico estimate
                            was low, since it did not take full account of the increasing cost of
                            weapons and of research and development. He thought it would be
                            impossible to maintain 2,850,000 men with expenditures of $48 to $40
                                [<hi rend="italic">$50</hi>?] billion. He felt that forces must be
                            reduced if expenditures were to be cut. He added that Defense was about
                            to make a complete review of its projections. However, he was worried
                            about a “leak” in a political year.</p>
                        <p>The President said that political year or not, we could not let people
                            run wild before Congress.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> said that $10 billion of the $54
                            billion total was attributable to elements of national security policy
                            other than the defense program. Presentations would now be made on these
                            other programs, beginning with the Atomic Energy Program.</p>

                        <p>At the conclusion of Admiral Strauss’ presentation, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that Government activities
                            appear to have a life of their own: they double in ten years, or, if the
                            advice of scientists is accepted, in two years. He had stopped
                            development of nuclear aircraft once, but now the project was going
                            again and would waste a lot of money. It was even proposed that a plane
                            weighing 600,000 pounds be built, although it would in his opinion be of
                            little use as a weapon.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">2 sentences (54 words) not declassified</hi>]
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> wondered
                            whether we weren’t building nuclear weapons beyond the requirements.
                            Admiral Strauss said the large increase in numbers was due to building a
                            great many small weapons which would be widely dispersed. He felt that
                            nuclear weapons were the least expensive weapons in our arsenal. Admiral
                            Strauss added that of course at some time we would have to put on the
                            brakes.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> agreed that the
                            numbers of nuclear weapons had increased because of emphasis on smaller
                            weapons and wide dispersal. He added that this spring we had trouble in
                            Congress resisting a bigger program. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said we must get accustomed to
                            fighting the pressure of vested interests which wanted larger <pb xml:id="pg_351" n="351" facs="0375"/>programs. <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> said we were dealing
                            with great intangibles; we must make guesses and take calculated risks.
                            The President said the time would come when we would have to fight
                            Congress to get enough money. He was sure that the present period, when
                            the Congress gives us more than we want, would be of short duration. The
                            President said he remembered the time when Congress wouldn’t permit one
                            division to stay in Korea, despite the pleas of the military, and look
                            what happened. The President said that of course there was no exact
                            answer to some of these problems, but that we did want to find out where
                            money was being wasted.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> asked how much
                            nuclear material now being used for military purposes could be used for
                            peaceful purposes if a disarmament agreement should be concluded.
                            Admiral Strauss replied that all the nuclear material was intact, there
                            being no perceptible deterioration in our lifetime, so that it could be
                            used for peaceful purposes in the future.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> wondered why it
                            was necessary to push the program of atomic power plants, and thought
                            that perhaps some indirect subsidization was involved. In response to a
                            question from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>,
                            Admiral Strauss said the time was not far off, perhaps only five years
                            away, when atomic power reactors could compete economically in high-cost
                            areas with power plants using fossil fuel.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">The Mobilization Program</hi> was presented by the
                            Director, Office of Defense Mobilization.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> asked whether the
                            titanium program was not being pushed too hard. He said we couldn’t do
                            the proper job for the country if highly scientific things were pushed
                            without regard to cost. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said research could be ruinous if it got out of
                            hand. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> thought
                            that some of the ideas behind the stockpile were as dead as <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> commitments. He felt we wouldn’t need
                            materials for a long war in this nuclear age, and that the whole
                            mobilization program should be reviewed. Considerable money was being
                            wasted on an outdated mobilization base concept. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> said that some of his programs
                            were based upon military requirements, and that he would be glad to take
                            another look at them in the light of the revised military programs. He
                            added that the program he had presented reflected modifications in
                            mobilization policy agreed on by the Council two or three months
                            ago.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">The Civil Defense Program</hi> was presented by the
                            Federal Civil Defense Administrator.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of Governor <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName>’s presentation, the President asked whether
                            there were any comments, or whether everyone was scared to death. He
                            asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> what the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was doing in civil defense.
                            Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> replied that he didn’t think the Soviets
                            were doing very much, but he would look into the question.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_352" n="352" facs="0376"/>
                        <p>The President wondered how far we could go until we reached a state of
                            complete futility. He knew the United States could withstand a heavy
                            attack, but he didn’t know how much it could take. With reference to the
                            figure of $13 billion for shelters, the President thought it would be
                            easy to spend $113 billion on this program if we provided really good
                            shelters. In thinking about this problem, he continued, we always reach
                            the point of realizing that an attack on any such scale as contemplated
                            in Governor <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName>’s
                            presentation would result in the paralysis of both sides. He felt the
                            problem was virtually unsolvable. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> reported that someone had said we don’t know what
                            weapons will be used in World War III, but in World War IV everyone will
                            have to use rocks.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> asked whether there
                            had been any consideration of combining shelters with structures having
                            a peacetime use. Governor <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName>
                            said that the Swedish pattern of building great underground shelters
                            which were also used as garages, had been studied. The $13 billion
                            estimate for shelters might be reduced if shelter construction could be
                            made a joint undertaking with private business. He admitted that
                            shelters cost a great deal of money, but said that it would not be of
                            much use to spend $40 billion for military forces when they could not
                            defend the people of the United States. His conclusion was that war is
                            obsolete and military forces are obsolete, and he thought perhaps the
                            world was losing its sanity. The President said that everyone could
                            agree with the latter conclusion.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that
                            perhaps shelter construction should be financed by a voluntary tax, with
                            only the sums voluntarily collected being spent. Governor <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName> asked whether anyone would be
                            willing to apply this principle to military programs.</p>
                        <p>The President said he considered the psychological effects on the people
                            of nuclear weapons developments to be very important. Governor <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName> recalled that a study of this
                            problem was underway.<note n="10" xml:id="d86fn10">See <ref target="#d95">Documents 95</ref> and <ref target="#d96">96</ref>.</note>

                            all of these figures would be reviewed through normal budgetary
                            processes.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">The Internal Security Program</hi> was presented by
                            the Acting Chairman, Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference, as to
                            investigative aspects, and by the Chairman, Interdepartmental Committee
                            on Internal Security, as to the remaining aspects. There was no

                        <p>At this point the President wondered whether the meeting tomorrow should
                            be a meeting of the Council or a small meeting in his office of those
                            most directly concerned with the military programs. He thought perhaps
                            it was not appropriate to have a Council meeting on the military
                            programs until the figures became Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s figures. Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName>
                            pointed out that not only the military program, but also the mutual
                            security program, was on tomorrow’s agenda.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> asked whether
                            the departments that had made presentations should not review their
                            programs. The President said that none of the programs presented were
                            approved by the Council. He said the agencies devised programs to
                            accomplish basic policy, priced them out, and then tried to get the
                            money from Budget. Then both the agency and the Budget Bureau came to
                            the President. If a policy question was involved, it was referred to the
                            National Security Council. If not, the President decided. The President
                            hoped that no one was laboring under the impression that the programs
                            presented this morning were approved.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said we should
                            start with last year’s expenditure figure and decide how much to reduce
                            from that point. Some such measuring device must be adopted, else there
                            was no limit to the expansion of programs.</p>
                        <p>The President noted that both the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> presentations had revealed large
                            expenditures based on military requirements. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> thought that many agencies
                            sought to base their programs on military requirements as a
                            justification for expansion. He recalled that after the Korean war
                            military expenditures had been reduced by $8 billion, while other
                            expenditures had increased by $6 billion.</p>
                        <p>The President at this point referred to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>’s earlier statement that
                            certain governmental expenditures were annually equal to the assets of
                            25 big corporations. The President thought this analogy striking, but
                            was not sure of its relevance to the problem at hand. Moreover,
                            continued the President, many government expenditures are not
                            unproductive, but go to building up assets such as roads, hospitals and
                            schools.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that the
                            military costs should be given a good looking-over again. Economies
                            possible three years ago might not be possible now, however. The
                            President said that before Korea, military expenditures were $12 to $13
                            billion a year. Now we had gone up to a new norm in military
                            expenditure, and Congress was temporarily making political hay by giving
                            the Administration more money than it asked for. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that each Service wanted to
                            build itself up into the biggest in terms of promotion, prestige, etc.
                            The President said they don’t think of it that way; each <pb xml:id="pg_354" n="354" facs="0378"/>Service thinks it can do the
                            job best. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said
                            he didn’t think events in the world would have turned out differently in
                            recent years if our military program had been 50% greater. The President
                            agreed that once we reach a certain level of deterrence, we don’t need
                            to continue to build up.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Friday, August 17, 1956</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> said that today’s meeting was a
                            continuation of yesterday’s. The Council had heard presentations on all
                            the national security programs except the mutual security and military
                            programs. Today the latter two would be presented.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">The Mutual Security Program</hi> was presented by the
                            Director, International Cooperation Administration, and the Acting
                            Assistant Secretary of Defense (<gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss>).</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said he didn’t
                            understand how the figure given in the presentation for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> ($1.8 billion) fitted into the
                            regional figures. Mr. McGuire said that the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> total had been made up separately because it was
                            interesting; of course, it cut across regional lines—for example, it
                            included Turkey and Greece—and therefore duplicated regional
                            figures.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> said he wished to clarify a point
                            mentioned by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName>. The
                            presentations made yesterday had used expenditure, not program, figures.
                            Director <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> confirmed the
                            accuracy of Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName>’s remark.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that in
                            listening to the mutual security presentation he had noted that the lead
                            time for giving away dollars was not as great as the lead time for
                            building planes.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said he
                            understood that the programs presented today, as well as those presented
                            yesterday, were subject to budgetary review and were not being approved
                            by the Council. The President said that was correct, but pointed out
                            that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> had said that
                            the mutual security program expenditures for the next few years were
                            largely fixed because of the carry-over of unexpended funds.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> pointed out that
                            it was difficult to determine the foreign policy implications of our
                            assistance programs when they had to be planned so far in advance. He
                            understood that the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959 programs were
                            now being planned, although the situation might be entirely different in
                            1959. The President said it was difficult to make Congress see that our
                            assistance programs ought to be carried on with the greatest possible
                            flexibility and initiative.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_355" n="355" facs="0379"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> said it was
                            difficult to stop the assistance machine once it got started. He
                            referred especially to Yugoslavia and Egypt. He said he had recently
                            discovered that 14 Diesel locomotives were destined for Egypt, and
                            unimaginable difficulty had been experienced in getting them out of the
                            pipeline.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> asked whether
                            it was not a fact that 75 to 80% of mutual security assistance goes to
                            five places. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> said
                            this was the case if <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was
                            considered one place. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said we were talking about Taiwan, Korea,
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and Indochina for the most
                            part. The President said that Korea was a particularly difficult case.
                            If Communist Chinese forces were ever withdrawn from North Korea, we
                            might be able to reduce our assistance to the Republic of Korea.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said the Chinese
                            Communists might leave North Korea if we didn’t support so many South
                            Korean divisions, which were a big burden on the Korean economy.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> said North
                            Korea might reduce its forces if Syngman Rhee would quit making so many
                            “nasty noises”.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> then said he
                            had discovered that no one in the United States knows or can find out
                            how much U.S. money, in the form of grants, loans, etc., goes into any
                            given country from all sources. This is embarrassing, especially since
                            the recipient countries know how much they are getting. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said we are fortunate
                            that no scandals had developed. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said the situation was so confused that
                            scandals could not be uncovered if they existed. The President said he
                            believed that if our assistance programs were handled intelligently we
                            would get our biggest bargain per dollar spent. He thought our aid
                            programs were cheaper than buying obsolete military equipment.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">The Military Program</hi> was presented by the
                            Assistant Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) in the form of 31
                            charts.</p>
                        <p>In connection with comparative shipbuilding costs, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> asked whether naval vessels
                            had achieved an increase in fire power equivalent to the increase in
                            their cost. <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> said
                            the effective killing power of naval vessels had gone up more rapidly
                            than their cost. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>
                            wondered whether this was a good comparison. He said nuclear weapons
                            could be loaded on old carriers and old planes. <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> agreed that World War
                            II aircraft could carry nuclear weapons, but said they would soon be
                            shot out of the air, probably before they had delivered the weapons.</p>
                        <p>The President wondered how big our aircraft carriers were going to get
                            and why we proposed to put a nuclear reactor in a big vessel. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said Congress had
                            crowded him into doing this.</p>
                        <p>Following the presentation of a chart on the cost of putting an AAA
                            battalion in the field, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> noted that the production of missiles was very
                            expensive, much more so than aircraft production; <pb xml:id="pg_356" n="356" facs="0380"/>because when you shot a missile it was gone,
                            but you could continue to use the aircraft. The President said he
                            thought the missile method of fighting a war was very inefficient, but
                            we had to use that method for psychological if for no other reasons.</p>
                        <p>After presentation of a chart on the research and development program,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> asked how
                            anyone could intelligently supervise such an extensive research program.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he was
                            working at it. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>
                            felt that the scientists these days showed a tendency to run wild.</p>
                        <p>After presentation of a chart on new weapons systems, the President asked
                            if anyone really believed that a nuclear-powered bomber would be worth
                            while in our time. <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> said no. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that work on projects of this kind
                            explained the shortage of scientists, which had recently received so
                            much attention. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>
                            said that recent scientific and technical advances had been so great
                            that anything called research had become sacred. If he tried to cut down
                            on research he was apt to “get the business”. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that the Council must be
                            prepared for criticism, but must go ahead and reduce programs where
                            necessary. He added that some of the ideas in the <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> report would ruin us. The
                            President said he felt that on the whole the <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> report had been a moderating
                            influence. Some Congressmen were much more extreme. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> pointed out that he had held up
                            the nuclear aircraft project three years ago. He felt now that it was
                            foolish to go ahead until we had more evidence that nuclear propulsion
                            of aircraft would work.</p>
                        <p>After presentation of a chart on guided missile systems, the President
                            asked whether the three Services were competing in these programs. Mr.
                            McNeil said that all three Services were involved in these programs, and
                            that in some cases they were competing, especially in the cases of
                            Nike–Talos and Matador–Redstone. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he would get into trouble if he tried to
                            drop one of these projects. The President said we might have to get into
                            trouble; in any case, it would be no worse than the Suez problem.</p>
                        <p>Following presentation of a chart on continental defense programs,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that
                            considerable expense had been incurred in unifying continental air
                            defense commands. He added that the whole program was so new and
                            different, it was impossible to tell whether we were receiving our
                            money’s worth. <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName>
                            said no one could tell how good the continental defense is until it is
                            used against an attacking force.</p>
                        <p>Following presentation of a chart on the cost of airlifting a division,
                            the President said he would be flatly against providing for the
                            airlifting of any more divisions. He felt that some of the projects
                            being undertaken now were unwise. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that the principal <pb xml:id="pg_357" n="357" facs="0381"/>difficulty in defense programs was that there
                            was no measuring-stick as to the wisdom or efficiency of the programs.
                            In business, only those items which ultimately produced a profit were
                            manufactured; but, of course, this measure was not available in national
                            defense.</p>

                        <p>At its 297th meeting on September 20, the National Security Council
                            discussed the matter of a reappraisal of United States policy regarding
                            the entry into the United States of radioactive materials through
                            diplomatic shipments. The Council considered a Department of State
                            study, which had been authorized at the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting on March 8. This study, transmitted to the
                            Council by a memorandum from Executive Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LJSJ1">Lay</persName>, dated August 21, noted that
                            neither international agreements nor unilateral United States action on
                            this <pb xml:id="pg_359" n="359" facs="0383"/>subject was feasible at

                            on September 1, stated that the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            Planning Board concurred in the Department of State’s conclusions. J.
                            Edgar Hoover, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who was
                            acting as chairman of the Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference,
                            also endorsed the conclusions of the Department of State report, and
                            added that the <gloss target="#t_IIC1">IIC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ICIS1">ICIS</gloss> would keep the problem under

                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action No. 1603, concurred in
                            the conclusion of the Department of State study that “neither
                            international agreements nor unilateral U.S. action to prevent entry
                            into the United States of radioactive materials through diplomatic
                            shipments is feasible at this time,” and requested the <gloss target="#t_IIC1">IIC</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_ICIS1">ICIS</gloss> to keep the problem under continuing review and report
                            to the Council if developments occurred which would warrant

                        <p>In the meeting today, the President indicated he thought there should be
                            no decrease in U.S. divisions in Europe for the present, and no

                        <p>Nevertheless, he considers—as he has from the beginning of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> build-up—that the U.S. reinforcements

                            European forces were building up; however, practical considerations have
                            limited, and still limit, action or policy statements initiating
                            withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>The President considers that significant manpower savings can and should
                            be made by reducing the manpower strength of divisions, and by cutting
                            down on administrative overhead and support elements. In addition, he
                            feels that economy should be sought in other priority military
                            programs.</p>
                        <p>The President indicated general agreement with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ memorandum of October 1, 1956,
                            subject to revision of Section II thereof as agreed in the meeting. With
                            these revisions, no objection to the provisions of the outline was

                            National Science Foundation, and the National Academy of Science in
                            planning the program for launching an earth satellite as part of the US
                            participation in the International Geophysical Year 1957–58. Our studies

                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> So far as law is concerned, space beyond
                            the earth is an uncharted region concerning which no firm rules have
                            been established. The law on the subject will necessarily differ with
                            the passage of time and with practical efforts at space navigation.
                            Various theories have been advanced concerning the upper limits of a
                            state’s jurisdiction, but no firm conclusions are now possible.</p>
                        <p>A few tentative observations may be made: (1) A state could scarcely
                            claim territorial sovereignty at altitudes where orbital velocity of an
                            object is practicable (perhaps somewhere in the neighborhood of <pb xml:id="pg_363" n="363" facs="0387"/>200 miles); (2) a state would,
                            however, be on strong ground in claiming territorial sovereignty up
                            through the “air space” (perhaps ultimately to be fixed somewhere in the
                            neighborhood of 40 miles); (3) regions of space which are eventually
                            established to be free for navigation without regard to territorial
                            jurisdiction will be open not only to one country or a few, but to all;
                            (4) if, contrary to planning and expectation, a satellite launched from
                            the earth should not be consumed upon reentering the atmosphere, and
                            should fall to earth and do damage, the question of liability on the
                            part of the launching authority would arise.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">General Recommendation 2B–12–a:</p>
                        <p>“We recommend that comprehensive programs be instituted to provide
                            effective control of surface and, so far as possible, sub-surface
                            traffic in both oceans from the coastlines to beyond the likely striking
                            range of sea-launched attacks. For proper implementation:</p>
                        <p>“a. international arrangements should be made for the establishment of

                            Programs on June 30, 1956”). We have a single copy of the Defense <pb xml:id="pg_364" n="364" facs="0388"/>Report and three of its four
                            annexes: technological capabilities, the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> programs,
                            and military continental defense programs. We have had access to Annex

                            offices.</p>
                        <p>2. The Report is in general an excellent descriptive statement of the
                            status of our forces in 1956, projected along present lines to 1960. It
                            is not an analytical statement or a “new look”. It makes no attempt to
                            present, or select among, alternatives in force levels or composition
                            which changes in doctrine, the new technology, or budget decisions may
                            require. The Report is thus of no great assistance, for example, to a
                            reexamination of force commitments or strategy for Europe.</p>
                        <p>3. Within these limits a number of conclusions emerge which have major
                            implications for foreign policy:</p>
                        <p>a. <hi rend="italic">A fixed rate of military development in the period
                                from 1956–60 is assumed before the new weapons and delivery systems
                                affect US military programs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Force levels will remain relatively the same: total military personnel at
                            2.8 million in 1956 moving to 2.9 million in 1960 (Army from 1.03
                            million to 1.05; Navy from .87 million to .89; Air Force from .91 to
                            .98). Army divisions, now at 18 active and 4 reserve will be 19 active
                            and 3 reserve in 1960; Marine divisions will remain constant at 3. Air
                            Force combat wings now at 131 will be 132 in 1960, and <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> wines will decrease from 51 to 47.
                            Similarly, the production of military hard goods will be relatively
                            stationary: $14.4 billion in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 56,
                            leveling off to $14.8 billion “for some period of time”, with guided
                            missiles production offset by declines in vehicles, weapons, and
                            ammunition.</p>
                        <p>b. <hi rend="italic">In maintaining the nuclear deterrent a number of

                        <p>In <hi rend="italic">Continental Defense</hi>, improvements in our own
                            defense system are believed to be fully matched by improvements in the
                            Soviet capability to deliver an air attack against the US. Thus, despite
                            the present level of effort, our relative defense capability remains as
                            estimated in April 1955. Further, our improvements are not such as to
                            indicate a potential capability to prevent a “seriously damaging” attack
                            on the US. Attack damage studies indicate the mobilization base would
                            suffer damage ranging from “severe” to “catastrophic”, depending on
                            timing and on the effectiveness of defense.</p>

                            in personnel and combat effectiveness. Particular deficiencies are noted

                            distribution, antisubmarine and mine counter-measures and in Navy forces
                            hampered by “growing obsolescence that is outstripping modernization
                            measures’.</p>
                        <p>There is no discussion of the rate of deliveries planned for new weapons
                            to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in the 1956–60 period or the
                            effect these will have on maintaining <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>’s absolute or relative capabilities.</p>
                        <p>Two political developments draw specific comment: French movements to

                            developments in Iceland “could require a complete reexamination of US
                            military requirements in the North Atlantic area”.</p>

                            correct ground forces’ deficiencies; the development of effective air
                            and naval forces would be longer and more expensive.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602/1 directed that “within the

                                source text.</note> to deter … and to defeat … local aggression.”
                            The manner of treatment of the subject in the Report makes it impossible
                            to determine the extent of capability for local war in situations in
                            which less than total force may have to be applied. It does this by
                            lumping together all military forces—except nuclear—air, continental
                            defense, and missiles—in a single category of “ready forces … to respond
                            … to local aggression … and to carry out general war tasks.” The
                            resulting description of their organization ana capabilities does not
                            distinguish between local war and general war operations.</p>
                        <p>The Report notes that combat ready forces in the Far East Command and in
                            the Continental US could be deployed rapidly to Southeast Asia
                            “depending on the availability of lift”, but does not treat the probable
                            availability as to type, amount, or readiness. It does note that there
                            is “necessary amphibious lift immediately available” only for one
                            regimental combat team and a supporting air group.</p>

                        <p>The statement is made that: “If US forces in the Far East were committed
                            to the defense of Taiwan or Southeast Asia, the US capability to resist
                            Communist aggression in either Japan or Korea would be considerably
                            reduced.”</p>

                            estimated the operational date of the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> as 1960–61). Progress in the anti-missile missile
                            program is limited and ten years are estimated for the development of
                            needed radar tracking systems.</p>

                        <p>The Report notes that the greater availability of the B–52 and the KC–135

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JWH1">Jackson</persName> summarized the current
                            status of the recommendations of the Technological Capabilities Panel
                            (the so-called <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName>
                            Committee) with particular reference to the ten recommendations of the
                                <gloss target="#t_TCP1">TCP</gloss> which the Council had set aside
                            at an earlier meeting for subsequent consideration. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JWH1">Jackson</persName> also called attention to two
                            recommendations by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning
                            Board with respect to the ten recommendations referred to above. He then
                            called on Dr. Furnas<note n="8" xml:id="d92fn8">Clifford C. Furnas,
                                Assistant Secretary of Defense (Research and Development).</note>
                            for his report.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of Dr. Furnas’s brief summary, the President thanked
                            him and observed with a smile that it seemed to him that every new
                            survey of our problems by a scientific team seemed to result in
                            recommendations that we undertake additional things. He rather wished we
                            could find a team which would recommend programs which we could dispense
                            with. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> said
                            the President <pb xml:id="pg_368" n="368" facs="0392"/>would be happy to
                            hear that the Navy Department had just conducted such a survey, with

                            Army Airborne, Infantry and Armored Divisions. Only minor changes were
                            involved in the Armored Division organization. Airborne and Infantry
                            Divisions were cut quite substantially from present strengths. Four
                            principles were observed: adapting the Division to the atomic
                            battlefield; pooling at higher echelons all elements needed only
                            occasionally; taking advantage of improved communication equipment by
                            which a Commander can control substantially more than three subordinate
                            units; basing organization on new equipment, some of which must still be
                            developed.</p>
                        <p>The President spoke strongly in favor of smaller Divisions, and thought
                            the changes were in the right direction, although he would have
                            preferred units cut to a strength of about 10,000. He felt sure that on
                            an atomic battlefield there would be dispersion such as we have never
                            seen before. He thought that ground bursts would contaminate large
                            areas, and that small units—largely self-contained—would be needed which
                            could weave between contaminated areas. With such great dispersion the
                            Infantry company could include support weapons. (<persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Taylor</persName> pointed out that to a
                            considerable extent this was being done in the new organization.) The
                            President thought signal communications would be a difficult problem at
                            company and platoon <pb xml:id="pg_370" n="370" facs="0394"/>level.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Taylor</persName> said this was
                            true with present equipment but with “transistorized” radios, the
                            capability should approach the need. The President questioned the
                            assignment of personnel carriers as organic equipment. He is not
                            inclined to think the Division should be loaded down with them, but they
                            should be pooled at higher echelon. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General
                                Taylor</persName> said that the existing personnel carrier is
                            unsatisfactory but that a new lighter one is being developed, and would
                            be used both for personnel movement and for movement of supplies
                            cross-country.</p>
                        <p>The President said he thought there should not be a publicity campaign
                            about the divisional changes, and specifically thought that no emphasis
                            should be given to the placing of atomic weapons in the Division (he was
                            here following up on a memorandum from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JWH1">Jackson</persName> which I gave to him this morning).<note n="3" xml:id="d93fn3">Not found in the Eisenhower Library or Department of
                                State files.</note> He thought the Divisions should be regarded
                            simply as experimental. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General
                                Taylor</persName> said he wanted to phase into this new
                            organization, beginning in February, and extending through the following
                            year and a half or two years, and the President seemed to accept this
                            schedule.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Taylor</persName> asked if it would
                            be all right to inform the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            authorities of the new Division, and the President said that he thought
                            such action would be quite desirable. He asked if General Gruenther
                            wanted this done, and <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General
                                Taylor</persName> said he did. The <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> briefing would be on a classified basis.</p>
                        <p>Reverting to the matter of public announcement, the President recognized
                            that information as to the new Divisions would gradually become known;
                            he did not favor an active campaign of articles in Service journals,
                            magazines, etc.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> asked whether
                            there would be a proposal that the personnel being taken from the
                            Divisions would be used to form additional Divisions. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Taylor</persName> said that the savings
                            would be offset to some degree, which cannot now be determined, by
                            increases in corps and Army troops. The President said he would
                            certainly think that the adoption of the new Divisions, based on fuller
                            use of modern fire-power, would make possible over-all personnel
                            reductions.</p>

                        <p>I am attaching for your information a copy of a memorandum I have
                            recently received from the Joint Chiefs of Staff in regard to the force
                            levels and personnel strengths to be used as a basis for the preparation
                            of the Fiscal Year 1958 budget.<note n="2" xml:id="d94fn2">In this
                                memorandum, dated November 15, attached but not printed, the Joint
                                Chiefs of Staff noted that they agreed that the present
                                international situation required continuation of essentially the
                                present force levels and personnel strengths as far as preparation
                                of the fiscal year 1958 budget was concerned.</note> I am also
                            attaching a memorandum which I have addressed to the Secretaries of the
                            Military Departments in regard to personnel strengths.<note n="3" xml:id="d94fn3">In this memorandum to the Secretaries of the Army,
                                Navy, and Air Force, dated November 16, attached but not printed,
                                Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> suggested:
                                “At this time it would appear desirable to level off our active duty
                                military strength at about the levels now expected to be achieved at
                                the end of this calendar year and to maintain those strengths for
                                the following 18 months.”</note> These papers are forming the basis
                            for our review of the budgets submitted by the Military Departments, and
                            we expect to commence our review of those budget proposals on Monday, 26
                            November.</p>
                        <p>I have discussed with the Secretaries of the Military Departments and the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff as to how we would project our military programs
                            forward into Fiscal Year 1959 and subsequent years. It would seem
                            undesirable for us to fix a definite personnel ceiling or budgetary
                            limitation for the years ahead, and I have explained that I thought we
                            should discuss our forward program as being a substantially level one
                            with the definite assumption:</p>
                        <p>(a) That we would maintain essentially level personnel strengths and
                            force levels;</p>
                        <p>(b) That we would maintain essentially the same rate of expenditures for
                            the Department of Defense as a whole; and</p>
                        <p>(c) That the above program would be based on the premise that there would
                            be no inflation or deflation.</p>
                        <p>I thought that you might like to have the above information. I will keep
                            you informed as to the progress we are making in the preparation of our
                            1958 budget.</p>

                        <p>The President met this morning at 8:30 with the following:</p>
                        <p>Gov. <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Val Peterson</persName>, <gloss target="#t_FCDA1">FCDA</gloss>
                        </p>

                        </p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JWH1">William H. Jackson</persName>, Special
                            Assistant to the President</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The purpose of the meeting was to present to the President the report on
                            “The Human Effects of Nuclear Weapons Development” prepared for the
                            President and the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> by a panel,
                            organized and assisted by <gloss target="#t_FCDA1">FCDA</gloss>, under
                            the chairmanship of Dr. Fremont-Smith.<note n="2" xml:id="d95fn2">This
                                panel was organized in response to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action No. 1430–p; see <ref target="#d30fn9">footnote 9, Document 30</ref>. A summary of the report is
                                printed <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName> said that he was
                            glad to say that the the report was affirmative and a little
                            encouraging, and suggested that the President read the summary on page
                            3.</p>
                        <p>After reading the summary, the President said that this was just the kind
                            of thing he had been looking for. He wished, however, to add one word of
                            warning. He said that it was difficult during World War II for people to
                            get over the feeling, prior to an air attack, that “it can’t happen
                            here”. The problem is how you get people to face such a possibility
                            without getting hysterical. You must guard against a crowd reaction of
                            not knowing what to do, by getting individuals involved in finding the
                            best solution. The President said he had always considered the civil
                            defense problem basically one of gaining the cooperation and
                            participation of the local population in each community.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Fremont-Smith agreed with the President, based on the experience of
                            his panel. He said that as individuals they were appalled when they were
                            first presented with this problem. However, as they became involved in
                            studying it and trying to find the answers, they gradually developed
                            into a team working together toward a solution. He said, however, that
                            the panel members would never be the same. What the panel had in mind
                            was, in effect, a series of small groups throughout the country going
                            through a similar experience to that of his panel. He stressed that the
                            issues to be discussed should not solely be civil defense, but the
                            entire problem of national security in the nuclear age. He said that the
                            groups must have a positive approach for survival, trying to achieve
                            peace but being prepared for survival if war should come.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_373" n="373" facs="0397"/>
                        <p>The President said that the very increase in our strength which such a
                            program would achieve would have a deterrent effect on the possibilities
                            of war. It would also make us better prepared if war nevertheless
                            happened.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Fremont-Smith said that the development of teamwork through the
                            proposed program would also cause people to support the Government in
                            the steps necessary for our national security, even though some of them
                            may involve real dangers. He said that we must not only tell the groups
                            what we face, but also what we must do. We must get a spirit of working
                            together for peace.</p>
                        <p>The President said that this is what we must all conclude when we have
                            studied this problem.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName> spoke of the
                            exceedingly fine membership of the panel. He read parts of his
                            transmittal memorandum stressing the backgrounds of learning and
                            experience represented on the panel. He concluded that he felt that the
                            Government frequently did not make sufficient use of social
                            scientists.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he had been trying for two years to get such a
                            study as this. He said that people kept making studies and reports to
                            him of how we would fight wars, without giving sufficient attention to
                            the study of what would be happening to the people involved. He agreed
                            that there should be more studies from the social scientists’
                            viewpoint.</p>
                        <p>The President questioned whether the American Assembly<note n="3" xml:id="d95fn3">The American Assembly consisted of about 60 men and
                                women who met to study, discuss, and disseminate timely information
                                on contemporary problems facing the United States. <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> founded the American
                                Assembly in 1950 when he was President of Columbia
                                University.</note> would provide a useful forum for the proposed
                            program. He explained that the purpose of this Assembly had been to
                            integrate the entire university faculty into studying a particular
                            problem, after which businessmen would be brought in on the study.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Fremont-Smith said that the panel in fact had a group such as the
                            American Assembly in mind. He said that his Foundation was in fact a
                            similar effort in the social science field.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether we should not consider a modest budget item
                            to help set up similar study groups in each state. He thought, however,
                            that the work should not be broadened out too suddenly without having
                            developed leaders. He cited his experience in London, where everyone
                            volunteered for air defense work after the air attacks occurred.</p>
                        <p>On Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JWH1">Jackson</persName>’s suggestion, the
                            President agreed that the report should be studied first by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning Board to suggest the next step
                            for consideration by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>The President expressed his appreciation to Dr. Fremont-Smith for the
                            report, and to Governor <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName>
                            for having arranged it.</p>

                        <p rend="center">SUMMARY</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The Panel believes that:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>a. A massive nuclear attack on the United States resulting in casualties
                            of the order of 50,000,000, without drastically improved preparation of
                            the people, would jeopardize support of the National Government and of
                            the war effort, and might well result in national disintegration (p.
                            9).</p>
                        <p>b. The major weakness in the preparedness of our people results from the
                            fact that while pertinent information has been made available, it has
                            not been successfully conveyed to them. The people would, therefore, be
                            psychologically overwhelmed by the extent of damage and casualties in
                            such an attempted “knock-out” attack (p. 10).</p>
                        <p>c. The prospect, however, is not a hopeless one. A vigorously supported
                            program of “involvement” of the people would bring about a significant
                            change, not only in post-attack attitudes and behavior, but also in the
                            necessarily correlated pre-attack attitudes and behavior. A panel of
                            governmental and citizen leaders should plan and implement a program of
                            public education and action designed to involve <pb xml:id="pg_375" n="375" facs="0399"/>progressively increasing numbers of citizens,
                            their leaders, and organizations and institutions in the issues of
                            national security in the nuclear age, including preparation for any
                            possible nuclear attack and designed to sustain that involvement as
                            necessary over a prolonged period (p. 11).</p>
                        <p>d. Such a program of “involvement” of the people would increase national
                            unity and thereby strengthen the hands of our leaders in pursuing the
                            policies and taking the actions necessary to preserve and develop the
                            basic values of democracy. It would also result in greater citizen
                            support of national efforts to prevent war (p. 17).</p>
                        <p>e. Involvement of the people would be substantially stimulated by
                            independent evidence that action is being taken by Government at all
                            levels to strengthen our civil defense program. To the maximum extent,
                            civil defense programs and recommended measures should be blended into
                            the normal governmental machinery and community patterns, and should
                            have a recognizable social value in peacetime (p. 13).</p>
                        <p>f. Increased awareness of nuclear weapons effects would, to a varying
                            extent in different nations, create public attitudes which would tend to
                            restrain the initiation of general war by the duly constituted leaders
                            of nations. (See text, page 19, for qualifications of this
                            judgment.)</p>
                        <p>g. The heritage and institutions of the American people give them the
                            potential strength to meet successfully the complex problems and perils
                            of the nuclear age, but that strength must be nourished by effective
                            knowledge and inspiring leadership (p. 12).</p>
                        <p>2. While we are unanimous in the judgments expressed above, we suggest
                            that they be tested systematically during the period of implementation
                            of any program of action which is adopted. The skills and tools required
                            for this purpose are themselves well tested and available (p. 12).</p>

                        <p>There was discussion of proposals for dispersal of nuclear weapons. A
                            memorandum on the matter was shown to the President, and discussed with
                            him. Charts showing the planned deployment were also shown and
                            discussed.</p>
                        <p>The President stressed the desirability of having a considerable number
                            of weapons in “safe reserve.” If too many were in forward bases, our
                            ability to strike back after attack might be endangered. <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> thought that attention
                            could well be given to assuring greater safety of those intended for
                                <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> units in this country.</p>
                        <p>There was discussion of the advisability of carrying weapons in aircraft
                            during their changes in deployment.</p>
                        <p>The President said he thought we must distribute these weapons in
                            accordance with the best judgment of the Joint Chiefs. He would assume
                            that necessary State Department concurrence was obtained.</p>
                        <p>Following further discussion, <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> undertook to determine what percentage of the

                                areas.<note n="3" xml:id="d97fn3">According to an entry for November
                                21 in the President’s diary, <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> dictated the following note concerning
                                this meeting: “I approved today the Joint Chiefs of Staffs’ plan for
                                the dispersal to bases, fields and ships afloat all the present
                                atomic stock pile, nuclear and fission. I informed the Chairman of
                                the Chiefs of Staff that (a) the State Department should be in
                                agreement with all dispersal involving overseas bases, and (b)
                                today’s dispersal should mark the approximate number of those to be
                                maintained permanently in the field. The bulk of those manufactured
                                hereafter (except for air defense types) should be kept in United

                        <p>On December 3, the first meeting of the Operations Coordinating Board Ad
                            Hoc Working Group on Publicity in Connection With the Launching of
                            Ballistic Missiles took place. This group had been formed when the
                            Department of Defense decided to seek the advice of the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> with respect to publicity in connection
                            with the test launching of the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>. According to a memorandum of

                            Staff Representative, the Defense Department sought <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> advice because it would have been
                            difficult to maintain complete secrecy in this matter, due to the fact
                            that the missiles, when placed on their launching stands at Patrick Air
                            Force Base in Florida, would have been visible from the open sea and the
                            noise of the test firings would have been markedly greater than anything
                            previously noticed in that area. Furthermore, even though the Defense
                            Department would have preferred not to make any announcement on the
                            missiles until they had achieved full flight, it recognized that in view
                            of the recent Soviet statement regarding rockets during the Suez crisis,
                            the United States might find it desirable to have ready a stand-by press
                            packet designed primarily for psychological purposes, as well as for
                            disclosure to the press, in the event that knowledge of the firings
                            became widespread, or in case there was a misfire or accidental air
                            burst. (Memorandum of meeting, December 4; Department of State, <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> Files: Lot 61 D 385, Ballistic

                        <p>The Ad Hoc Working Group held several meetings during December, and on
                            December 12 the Operations Coordinating Board agreed, among other
                            things, that the Working Group “should be continued indefinitely with

                        <p>There was extended discussion of the military budget for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>-58. The President had read a memorandum
                            of analysis prepared by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName>,<note n="2" xml:id="d99fn2">Not found in the
                                Eisenhower Library or Department of State files.</note> which he
                            considered excellent. Discussion brought out that a major segment of the
                            budget is moving into the area of procurement, production, naval
                            construction, and construction of facilities. On the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>, the President said that the main
                            significance attaches to the first few of these missiles, and that
                            consequently we should press forward strongly with development, but
                            should hold down procurement. The President said he saw no reason for
                            major programs for the development of atomic powered aircraft—that
                            development of the reactor could and should go forward, on an orderly
                            basis, under <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> auspices. He saw no
                            particular reason for building one of the large carriers every year; he
                            agreed to building one atomic powered carrier in order to determine its
                            operational advantages, but thought that our program should be at the
                            rate of one big carrier every other year.</p>
                        <p>After considering the Defense proposals on a line by line basis, the
                            President asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> to
                            have the budget prepared on the basis of $38 billion for expenditures,

                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>, Chairman of the
                            Council’s Net Evaluation Subcommittee, introduced General Gerald C.
                            Thomas, Director of the Subcommittee Staff, who outlined briefly the
                            approach taken by the Subcommittee and its Staff in preparing the 1956
                            Net Evaluation. He indicated that pursuant to the Subcommittee’s terms
                            of reference the Staff prepared two hypothetical Soviet war plans based
                            on the following concepts: (a) An assumption of “Strategic Surprise”,
                            and (b) an assumption of “Full Alert in the United States”. In these
                            plans the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was credited with
                            capabilities as estimated in pertinent National Intelligence Estimates.
                            An operational analysis group was established to war-game the
                            hypothetical Soviet war plans against hypothetical U.S. war plans, and
                            this analysis group concerned itself with such tasks as (a) battle
                            analysis; (b) assessment of damage to U.S. military forces and
                            installations; (c) provision of data for further U.S. damage assessment
                            by agencies directly concerned; (d) provision of data for assessment of
                            damage in the Soviet bloc to the extent required by <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5605; and (e) estimation of residual
                            military capabilities on both sides.</p>
                        <p>General Thomas introduced Colonel S.D. Kelsey, <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>, who covered in some detail the Subcommittee’s
                            findings under the assumption of a Soviet achievement of “Strategic
                            Surprise”. Colonel Kelsey thereupon introduced Captain W.B. Stevens,
                                <gloss target="#t_USN1">USN</gloss>, who briefed the Council on the
                            general impact and effects on U.S. national resources of the Soviet
                            attacks perpetrated under the concept of “Strategic Surprise”.</p>
                        <p>Colonel W. L. Kindred, <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>, then briefed
                            the Council on the findings of the Subcommittee based on the assumption
                            of “Full Alert”, and he in turn introduced Mr. Ludwell Montague, of
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, who briefed <pb xml:id="pg_380" n="380" facs="0404"/>the Council on the Subcommittee’s findings with
                            respect to the clandestine threat under the assumption of both
                            “Strategic Surprise” and “Full Alert”.</p>
                        <p>General Thomas next invited the Council’s attention to the variable
                            critical factors involved in the preparation of net evaluations of this
                            type, noting that variations in any one or more of the factors could
                            substantially alter the Subcommittee’s evaluations. He indicated that
                            these variable critical factors involve such vital subjects as (a) the
                            size and make-up of the Soviet nuclear weapons stockpile; (b) the future
                            size and composition of the Soviet long-range air force; (c) the number
                            of Soviet guided missiles of various types expected to be operational in
                            1959; (d) actual and potential Soviet electronic countermeasures and
                                counter-<gloss target="#t_ECM1">ECM</gloss> capabilities; (e) the
                            status of U.S. forces in 1959, etc.</p>
                        <p>General Thomas indicated that, despite the variable factors mentioned
                            above and the lack of sufficient information concerning several of these
                            critical areas, the Subcommittee believed that its basic data were
                            adequate to support the following conclusions: (a) In 1959 a nuclear war
                            initiated by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would result in
                            the mutual devastation of both the United States and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and neither side could expect to
                            destroy the nuclear capability of the other or to be able to defend
                            itself adequately against nuclear attack; (b) in 1959 the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will have the net capability of
                            delivering a nuclear attack which could kill approximately 40% of the
                            U.S. population, seriously injure another 13%, and disrupt the
                            political, social, and economic structure of the United States; (c) if
                            the United States should fail to maintain adequate alert nuclear forces
                            that cannot be destroyed by surprise attack, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> by nuclear attack on the continental
                            United States will emerge as the dominant world power in 24 hours; (d)
                            the massive nuclear retaliatory capability of the United States is an
                            indispensable deterrent to Soviet attack, but if the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> were nevertheless to attack, this
                            capability could not prevent catastrophic destruction in the United
                            States; (e) with the advent of long-range ballistic missiles, the
                            present concept of the military and civil defense of the United States
                            against nuclear weapons will require extensive revision in view of the
                            drastically reduced amount of warning time available against “Surprise
                            Attack”.</p>
                        <p>Following the completion of the formal presentation by the Subcommittee
                            Staff, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> stressed
                            the following points concerning the 1956 net evaluation: (a) The
                            evaluation was based upon an immense effort by the Subcommittee Staff
                            and by member agencies of the Subcommittee, which effort he was sure
                            warranted commendation; (b) in the preparation of the report each of the
                            members of the Council’s Subcommittee acted only within the area of
                            responsibility of his own agency, and members of the Subcommittee did
                            not participate in, nor judge the validity of results of, the military
                            operations analysis <pb xml:id="pg_381" n="381" facs="0405"/>which is
                            the basis of the 1956 report; (c) certain of the information in the
                            report is highly sensitive in nature and therefore necessitates the
                            exercise of special security precautions in the handling of the report
                            and the ancillary submissions on which it was based; (d) the report
                            indicates a very detailed study of the U.S. Air Defense system and
                            highlights weaknesses in that system; (Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> indicated that a committee has
                            been set up to restudy and to report by next July on the Air Defense
                            system) (e) the assumptions on which the report is based can vary
                            widely, as emphasized by General Thomas, and as a consequence the Net
                            Evaluation Report of 1956 should not be considered as a factual report.
                            (Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> said that if
                            the United States were subjected to a nuclear attack, the results might
                            be along the lines indicated in the report; on the other hand, they
                            might be either considerably worse or considerably less severe.)</p>
                        <p>The President indicated that the Subcommittee’s presentation prompted
                            several observations on his part. He queried as to why we should put a
                            single nickel into anything but developing our capacity to diminish the
                            enemy’s capacity for nuclear attack. Rather than worry too much about
                            the submarine menace, protecting shipping on the seas, etc., the United
                            States should continue to concentrate on producing a force that is so
                            good and so well distributed that the Soviets will not attack; and if
                            they do attack, we should have also concentrated on our defenses so that
                            we will be capable of knocking the enemy down.</p>
                        <p>The President said he believed that if there is a general alert and a
                            general mobilization in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, as
                            envisaged under the “Full Alert” concept, the clandestine threat will
                            disappear [<hi rend="italic">remainder of paragraph (40 words) not
                                declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>The President stated that in considering the magnitude and gravity of the
                            problems covered in the Net Evaluation study, we come to the point of
                            asking how much can or will the United States stand. He thought that the
                            picture of the terrific destruction resulting from a nuclear attack
                            warranted taking a look at the whole matter in terms of determining how
                            much destruction the United States and its people can absorb and still
                            survive.</p>

                        <p>After covering the highlights of the report, Governor <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName> introduced Mr. Jack
                                Greene,<note n="7" xml:id="d100fn7">Director, Radiological Defense
                                Division, <gloss target="#t_FCDA1">FCDA</gloss>.</note> who gave an
                            oral briefing on the effects of exposure to radioactive fall-out. He
                            pointed out that the destructive results from radioactive exposure are
                            extremely severe, and that the solution to this problem may be found
                            only in “evacuation, meaning distance, or shelter, meaning shielding.”
                            He indicated that the <gloss target="#t_FCDA1">FCDA</gloss> studies
                            reflect that evacuation is not practicable as the primary solution to
                            the problem, and as a consequence the <gloss target="#t_FCDA1">FCDA</gloss> has concluded that it must look to a greatly enlarged
                            shelter program if the U.S. population is to be protected against the
                            devastating results which will otherwise accrue from radioactive
                            exposure.</p>
                        <p>Following Mr. Greene’s briefing, Governor <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName> introduced Mr. Gerald R. Gallagher, who made a
                            detailed analysis of the shelter program being considered by <gloss target="#t_FCDA1">FCDA</gloss>, which analysis in the main proceeded
                            on the assumption that 20-megaton nuclear weapons would be employed
                            against the United States and that 30-PSI blast shelters would be
                            employed to provide reasonably adequate protection for the personnel
                            sheltered therein. Mr. Gallagher stated that in <gloss target="#t_FCDA1">FCDA</gloss>’s approach to the problem it believes that special
                            study should be given to locating shelters in such manner as to give
                            protection from both blast and fall-out to a maximum number of people.
                            According to <gloss target="#t_FCDA1">FCDA</gloss>’s present thinking,
                            fifty million individuals will require shelters at a total estimated
                            cost of $32.4 billion, $28.6 billion of which represents the Federal
                            Government’s portion of this cost.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName> emphasized that
                            the evacuation concept is not being abandoned by <gloss target="#t_FCDA1">FCDA</gloss>; that evacuation should continue to
                            be encouraged; that in <gloss target="#t_FCDA1">FCDA</gloss>’s judgment
                            the primary civilian defense of the population against nuclear attack
                            was to be found in a greatly enlarged shelter program. Accordingly,
                            Governor <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName> recommended, in
                            sum, legislative modifications (a) to provide for the initiation of a
                            civil defense shelter program; (b) to permit greatly increased Federal
                            support and financial assistance to the states and their political
                            subdivisions in order to enable them to adequately develop their defense
                                <pb xml:id="pg_383" n="383" facs="0407"/>capabilities; (c) to vest
                            larger civil defense responsibility in the Federal Government in order
                            to make civil defense the joint responsibility of both Federal and local
                            governments, etc. Governor <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName> indicated that <gloss target="#t_FCDA1">FCDA</gloss>’s proposed legislative program envisaged amendments to
                            its organic act<note n="8" xml:id="d100fn8">The Federal Civil Defense
                                Act of 1950 (64 Stat. 1245).</note> to authorize a Federal Public
                            Shelter Construction Program to provide the population with a
                            substantial degree of protection against the effects of modern weapons,
                            as well as amendments to appropriate Acts “to provide financial
                            incentives for home shelter construction by individuals by (1) making
                            available Federal mortgage insurance covering loans up to $2500 for such
                            construction; and (2) providing an income tax deduction up to $2500 for
                            such expenses.”</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName> indicated that a
                            greatly enhanced Federal program of leadership is required in the civil
                            defense field and that much more Federal participation, as well as
                            leadership, is essential in all important aspects of the civil defense
                            program.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that he did
                            not see how we can do all of the things referred to by Governor
                                <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName> and at the same time
                            limit ourselves to a 35-hour work week, as has been proposed. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> thought that rather
                            than decreasing the number of hours in our work week, we should go the
                            other way.</p>
                        <p>In response to the President’s inquiry, Governor <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName> advised that suitable home
                            shelters have already been designed.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired as to how the air in these shelters is screened to
                            eliminate radioactive particles. Governor <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName> responded that in the smaller shelters
                            charcoal, fiberglass, glass wool, etc., provides sufficient screening,
                            but that the shelters housing larger groups would necessitate more
                            elaborate screening and air-conditioning equipment.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName> indicated that,
                            without disparaging <gloss target="#t_FCDA1">FCDA</gloss>’s report, he
                            thought it was essential to point out that, so far as we know, there are
                            no 20- or 60-megaton weapons in existence, although the <gloss target="#t_FCDA1">FCDA</gloss> report was apparently based, at least
                            in part, on the assumption that weapons of that magnitude would be
                            employed in a nuclear attack on the United States. To this, Governor
                                <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName> responded that the
                            problem becomes even more aggravated if one proceeds on the assumption
                            that smaller nuclear weapons would be employed in such an attack.</p>

                        <p>The Special Assistant to the President informed the Council that the only
                            item on the agenda for this meeting was a discussion of the U.S.
                            military program for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958. He then
                            called upon Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, who
                            in turn stated that Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> would make the initial statement with respect to
                            this military program.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> said that he
                            proposed to open the presentation with a brief review of the background
                            of military thinking and estimates of the military situation as these
                            two considerations bore on the Defense Department budget. He said he
                            would start with the Joint Chief of Staff review initiated by an order
                            of the Secretary of Defense in August 1953. The subsequent special study
                            and review came up with certain important conclusions:</p>
                        <p>(1) The primary national responsibility was to ensure the survival of the
                            United States as a free nation with a viable free economy.</p>
                        <p>(2) The principal threat to the United States was the long-range Soviet
                            objective of destroying democracy and democratic institutions throughout
                            the world.</p>
                        <p>(3) The most critical military factors in defense against this Soviet
                            threat were the air defense of the continental United States and
                            maintenance of our retaliatory capabilities against the Soviet
                            Union.</p>
                        <p>(4) At the present time our military posture was seriously
                            overextended.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_385" n="385" facs="0409"/>
                        <p>(5) In order to rectify this overextension, it would be necessary to
                            curtail the deployment of U.S. forces overseas.</p>
                        <p>(6) If such redeployment was carried out, the Joint Chiefs believed it to
                            be essential that the national objectives of the United States short of
                            a general war should be clearly stated so that our friends would be
                            assured and our enemies made perfectly clear as to our intentions.</p>
                        <p>(7) The Chiefs believed that the United States must significantly improve
                            its intelligence effort.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> then stated that
                            the foregoing conclusions had since that time constituted the broad
                            basis of our military planning. In addition, however, in 1954 and in
                            1955 large-scale studies were undertaken with the objective of analyzing
                            the effect on our military posture of the rapid development of
                            technology. Examples of such studies were those of Mr. Robert Sprague
                            and of the committee headed by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d101fn2">Reference is
                                presumably to the report by Robert Sprague on Continental Defense,
                                discussed by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> at its 252d
                                meeting on June 16, 1955. The report is not printed, but see <ref target="#d28fn4">footnote 4, Document 28</ref>. The <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> Committee report is
                                printed as <ref target="#d9">Document 9</ref>.</note> The studies by
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName>’s committee had made strong
                            recommendations hi favor of strengthening the continental defense of the
                            United States. The Joint Chiefs of Staff, however, have reserved their
                            opinion as to the ratio of resources to be devoted on the one hand to
                            strengthening our continental defense and on the other to competing
                            demands on these resources. They regarded this ratio as one requiring
                            very delicate balancing.</p>
                        <p>By January 1956, continued Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>, it became evident that another full-scale
                            review of our military program would be necessary. Such a re-examination
                            was accordingly commenced by the Joint Chiefs of Staff on the orders of
                            the Secretary of Defense. After the meeting of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                            in Puerto Rico, it was concluded that our basic military program
                            remained generally valid, but that to maintain this program over the
                            future years would certainly involve increasing costs because of such
                            factors as missile development, development of continental defense
                            measures, and the introduction of new weapons. Nevertheless, the Joint
                            Chiefs estimated that our annual military expenditure up to 1960 could
                            be held to a level of approximately $38 to $40 billion. Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> said that he
                            personally had felt that this level was somewhat on the low side. The
                            Chiefs also estimated that our military defense assistance program would
                            require expenditures of approximately $3 billion a year, although under
                            certain circumstances this amount could be increased by as much as $1 or
                            $2 billion a year.</p>
                        <p>In this review, as in the earlier review of 1953, the Joint Chiefs
                            reaffirmed their view as to the desirability of reducing our overseas
                            commitments and deployments, although they pointed out that this <pb xml:id="pg_386" n="386" facs="0410"/>would be next to impossible in
                            the Far East and would be very difficult to accomplish without
                            undermining <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> if the redeployment of
                            U.S. forces occurred too rapidly. In any event, in this review the Joint
                            Chiefs of Staff strongly recommended a full scale review of our military
                            aid programs.</p>
                        <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff concluded in March and April of 1956 that, in
                            spite of the fact that our own U.S. military posture was generally
                            adequate, the military posture of the free world generally was
                                deteriorating.<note n="3" xml:id="d101fn3">See <ref target="#d64">Documents 64</ref>, <ref target="#d65">65</ref>, and <ref target="#d73">73</ref>.</note> Unless this deterioration were
                            arrested, the results would put the United States in a very dangerous
                            situation in the future. The Chiefs also stressed the need for vigorous
                            political, economic and psychological courses of action, on grounds that
                            we must assure the world that the United States was prepared to act in a
                            timely fashion in the event of war in order to restore and bolster the
                            morale of the free world.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> then noted that
                            since this report of the spring of 1956, world events had moved quickly
                            and not always in a direction which had been predicted. As examples he
                            cited tension in the satellites and the crisis in the Middle East. These
                            events have led the Joint Chiefs of Staff to recommend certain actions
                            designed to achieve our national security objectives. After briefly
                            referring to these measures, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> said that in conclusion he wanted to emphasize
                            once again that both now and in the future the costs of our military
                            program would continue to rise. In his view it was not possible at one
                            and the same time to maintain a fixed level of forces and a fixed
                            budgetary level. It was accordingly necessary for us to lower the level
                            of our forces while at the same time assuring them increased
                            effectiveness. He believed that this great problem could be solved if we
                            kept ever in mind a basic objective and a basic fact. First, our
                            objective of ensuring the survival of the United States and its free
                            economy, and second, that the principal threat to the United States
                            remained Russian-dominated world Communism.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>’s introductory remarks, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> would outline the program of
                            the Army for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958. General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> stated that it was his proposal
                            to present the kind of Army that could be attained at the end of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 within a budget of $9 billion. Such
                            an Army would consist of 1,000,000 men in 17 reorganized divisions,
                            etc., etc.. With the use of a chart,<note n="4" xml:id="d101fn4">Neither
                                this chart nor the ones mentioned below has been found in the
                                Eisenhower Library or Department of State files.</note> General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> discussed the five
                            major categories of which this Army would consist—namely, overseas
                            forces, strategic reserves, anti-aircraft defense forces for the United
                            States, reserve forces, and <pb xml:id="pg_387" n="387" facs="0411"/>forces for the support of our allies. These five categories, he
                            pointed out, would be backed up by support forces deployed within the
                            continental United States. Thereafter, General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>, with the assistance of a
                            chart, briefly outlined the major Army unit forces deployment planned
                            for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958, after which he described in
                            some detail the quality and qualifications of these forces. He added a
                            warning that the Army could not afford to neglect so-called conventional
                            arms and equipment.</p>
                        <p>In closing his report, General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> summed up assets and liabilities for the Army
                            program as follows: With respect to assets, he indicated that the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 program would certainly enhance the
                            combat effectiveness of the U.S. Army. A second asset would be the
                            improved quality of our reserve forces. In the category of liabilities,
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> pointed out that
                            the Army divisions would be reduced by two, and that the growing
                            obsolescence factor was very serious. An additional liability was
                            represented by the deterioration of our antiaircraft capabilities for
                            the air defense of the United States.</p>
                        <p>Upon the conclusion of General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s presentation, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> called on Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> to describe the Navy Department
                            program for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> remarked that the
                            Navy had been working on this 1958 budget for a whole year past. The
                            Navy Department proposed to request approximately $10.9 billion in new
                            authorizations in its <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 budget—a
                            sum slightly less than that in the current Navy budget. Force levels for
                            the Navy would be about the same as in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1957. Despite steady technological advances, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> pointed out that the budget for
                            research and development in the Navy had been reduced in favor of
                            additional aircraft procurement and shipbuilding.</p>
                        <p>In the course of discussing the Navy’s aircraft procurement program,
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> indicated that
                            1257 new aircraft would be ordered for the Navy in the course of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958, a figure less than the figure for
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956 or <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> concluded his discussion of the Navy program by a
                            detailed statement on the shipbuilding and conversion programs. This
                            portion of his report was accompanied by a chart entitled “Combat
                            Effective Ships, 1956, vs. Present Planned Strength” (over a period of
                            five years).</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName>’s comments, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> asked General <persName corresp="#p_PLGRM1">Pate</persName> if he wished to report on the Marine Corps program.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_PLGRM1">Pate</persName> replied that
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> had spoken for
                            him, and that he had nothing to add. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> then called on General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> to present the Air Force
                            program for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> spoke first from
                            two charts. One was entitled “Comparison of Programs”; the second was
                            entitled “New Obligating Authority and Service Obligations for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957 and <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958”. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> pointed out that the Air Force program called
                            for a request on <pb xml:id="pg_388" n="388" facs="0412"/>the Congress
                            for $17.7 billion in new obligational authority. He indicated that this
                            was about $3 billion less than the Air Force would have wished to ask
                            for in order to meet its estimated requirements. In general, however,
                            the Air Force proposed to cut its program to fit the cloth. For example,
                            there would be a cut in procurement of B–52 aircraft from about 20 to 15
                            or 17 a month. The objective of the B–52 procurement program called
                            ultimately for 11 wings of this type of aircraft.</p>
                        <p>At this point General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName>
                            turned to a discussion of the combat structure of the Air Force. This
                            indicated a reduction in program combat wings from a total of 137 to a
                            total of 128. The reduction would occur in the categories of fighter
                            aircraft and tactical bombers. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> believed that this cut could be justified by the
                            expected increase in firing power. He also pointed out that each B–52
                            wing would contain over 40 aircraft instead of 32, as originally
                            proposed. In addition, General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> indicated that the intermediate-range ballistic
                            missile would be put into the inventory of weapons in 1960. This would
                            be followed shortly thereafter by the addition of the intercontinental
                            ballistic missile to the inventory. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> concluded his remarks with the observation that
                            the presently programmed Air Force for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1958 represented the very minimum force that the United States should
                            have in order to protect the security of the United States and to carry
                            out the missions assigned to the Air Force by <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> policies.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> then called on
                            Assistant Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> for a brief analysis of the MDA program. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> made his report on the
                            basis of a series of charts entitled “Status Report on Military
                            Assistance Programs”. Included in his remarks was a statement of the
                            five major purposes of our military assistance program. He pointed out
                            that in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 there would be a request
                            upon the Congress by way of new obligational authority in the amount of
                            $2.45 billion. He predicted that expenditure for that fiscal year would
                            probably amount to about $2.6 billion. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> referred to the embarrassing
                            carry-over from previous fiscal years, but pointed out that the
                            carry-over for this year was the least in size in all recent years. The
                            total investment to date, from <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1950
                            through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957, in the MDA programs
                            amounted to $22.4 billion.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>’s report, the President turned to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BWM1">Brucker</persName> and asked him the following
                            question: “Are you confident that the Army program previously described
                            is the best Army program for the money?” Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BWM1">Brucker</persName> replied in the affirmative, and
                            said that the Army program for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958
                            represented the best balanced program which could be gotten for the
                            money. The one element, he said, which we wish to preserve is the combat
                            edge, the razor edge. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BWM1">Brucker</persName> stated that he was opposed to simply <pb xml:id="pg_389" n="389" facs="0413"/>dropping the personnel who
                            could be saved in the proposed cutting of Army divisions from 19 to 17.
                            He wanted this personnel to be enrolled in other extremely important
                            Army units. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BWM1">Brucker</persName>
                            also expressed anxiety over the cost of the upkeep of the Army plant,
                            and emphasized the need for better housing for Army personnel in the
                            near future.</p>
                        <p>In reply, the President stated his agreement that the Army is now
                            producing better balanced forces than it had in the past; but what
                            really concerned him, continued the President, was the correct balance
                            between the proposed strength of our Army and the general economic
                            strength and well-being of the country. This is the great decision which
                            must be made, and the President said he judged that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BWM1">Brucker</persName> thought the proposed <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 budget for the Army represented the
                            best balance that we can devise. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BWM1">Brucker</persName> again replied that the program represented the
                            best balance possible under the circumstance. He confessed that some of
                            his people were unhappy over certain aspects of the proposed <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 budget, but that he, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_BWM1">Brucker</persName>, thought it was OK.
                            The President said that, in short, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BWM1">Brucker</persName> believed that to go higher by way of budget for
                            the Army would entail serious risk of inflation and damage to the
                            nation’s economy. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BWM1">Brucker</persName> agreed.</p>
                        <p>The President then turned to Secretary Thomas and asked him to address
                            himself to the same questions with respect to the Navy that the
                            President had just put to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BWM1">Brucker</persName> respecting the Army.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Thomas indicated that he would like to state briefly the
                            philosophy behind the proposed <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958
                            budget for the Navy. In this connection he mentioned the President’s
                            statement of last fall to the effect that while we must never put
                            dollars above defense, we must at the same time have a strong and free
                            economy. Secretary Thomas said that he stood firmly behind this
                            philosophy, and added his belief that the proposed Navy budget
                            represented the best balance that was possible. He added that he
                            sincerely believed that this country had much more powerful military
                            forces than many of the critics believe, and he paid warm tribute to the
                            President and to the policies of the Administration.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Thomas then pointed out that the Navy had faced two very basic
                            problems in the course of formulating its <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 budget. The first of these stemmed from the Navy’s
                            worldwide commitments, as a result of which ships of the Navy had to be
                            stationed all over the world. Secondly, the Navy was currently going
                            through a transition greater than anything known in the past. The Navy
                            was moving all at once from conventional to nuclear power and from
                            conventional to nuclear weapons. The costs were obviously bound to be
                            much greater. In conclusion, Secretary Thomas stated that in his opinion
                            the proposed Navy budget was a very good and very acceptable program,
                                <pb xml:id="pg_390" n="390" facs="0414"/>even though, of course, it
                            involved a calculated risk. Indeed, said Secretary Thomas, if he had had
                            his own way he might have cut another billion or two from the Navy
                            budget. But, he said to the President, the Navy was the most powerful
                            Navy in the world, and that the proposed budget would keep the Navy in
                            just that position.</p>
                        <p>The President then called on Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> to answer the same questions. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> pointed out how
                            carefully the Air Force budget had been worked over. He said that it
                            represented the best balance which could be attained within the
                            framework of the proposed 1958 budget. The program put first things
                            first in terms of the missions of the Air Force. Though there were
                            clearly to be fewer wings in the Air Force, the Air Force itself would
                            actually be stronger. Nevertheless, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> warned that the Air Force
                            program was marginal in certain respects. After the exercise at the
                            National Security Council meeting of yesterday, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> said that he had come away with
                            certain misgivings. (The reference by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> was to the report of the Net
                            Evaluation Subcommittee of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> on
                            the net capabilities of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to
                            damage the continental United States.) Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> had wondered whether we were
                            doing quite all we should do in the light of the terrible threat
                            depicted in yesterday’s report. Despite this, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> said, he did not question the
                            proposed 1958 budget, and he assured the President that the Air Force
                            would give the budget loyal support and make the best of it.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> what he thought he could do right now to reduce
                            the appalling threat depicted yesterday in the report of the Net
                            Evaluation Subcommittee. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> said that so far as he could see, there was
                            nothing that one could do to reduce the threat markedly. Nevertheless,
                            it might be wise to increase our air defense forces and to allocate
                            larger funds to the building up of our own strategic striking force.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> said he was not
                            actually recommending the above course of action, but found the problem
                            troublesome.</p>
                        <p>The President stated firmly that the only area in which he disagreed with
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> was that the
                            President did not think that the suggested courses of action would
                            markedly reduce the threat of the holocaust described yesterday. In
                            short, if we do not now have enough military strength to deter the
                            Soviet Union from nuclear attack, the President said he could not be
                            sure that 20 times as much military strength would succeed in deterring
                            the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>The President then said that he had one more question to address to
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName>. How many
                            missiles can be carried in a B–52? General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> replied that two of the largest missiles were
                            within the capability of the B–52 to carry.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_391" n="391" facs="0415"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> then inquired
                            whether he might call on Assistant Secretary of Defense McNeil for an
                            analysis of the overall figures for the Defense Department budget for
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958. With the assistance of
                            charts, Secretary McNeil turned first to the new obligational authority,
                            the direct obligations, and the estimated expenditures for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958. He pointed out that the total new
                            obligational authority sought in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956
                            was $34.2 billion. In <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957 this amount
                            had risen to $36.7 billion. The request for new obligational authority
                            for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 would be $38.3 billion.
                            Turning to expenditures, Secretary McNeil indicated that the total for
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956 had been $35.7 billion; for
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957, $36 billion; and the
                            estimate for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 was $37.8
                            billion.</p>
                        <p>After further detailed analysis by Secretary McNeil, the President stated
                            that he wanted to make sure that at some point or other in the future
                            the country would at last be able to achieve a leveling-off period on
                            these expenditures and not face continually mounting costs.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> inquired whether
                            the over-all figures given by Secretary McNeil included or excluded the
                            figures earlier given by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> covering the military assistance programs. When
                            Secretary McNeil indicated that his figures did not include MDAP,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> emphasized that
                            this fact should be made crystal clear when Congress was briefed on the
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 budget.</p>
                        <p>At this point the President inquired whether there were any other
                            questions, and directed his inquiry particularly to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> replied that he thought it
                            unfortunate that everyone in the United States could not have heard this
                            Council briefing. He believed that the results showed a marvelous
                            coordination and teamwork. In fact, this was the “finest budget
                            performance” since the Administration had come into power. The President
                            replied facetiously that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> had made his own speech for him. The President
                            added that the proposed budget did represent some backing up in our hope
                            that we could go along at an expenditure level of about $35 billion
                            annually for the Defense Department program. Actually we were now pretty
                            close to $40 billion, but the President confessed that he did not see
                            how this latter amount could be reduced.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> commented that
                            other Executive departments’ and agencies’ expenditures had gone up by a
                            comparatively larger ratio than had those of the Department of Defense.
                            The President replied that this was no valid comparison. The other
                            departments and agencies had done their best, just as had the Department
                            of Defense. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> then
                            added that he thought that by and large the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 Department of Defense budget was a good budget and
                            that resources had been pretty well allocated among the Services. The
                            preparation of the budget had been characterized by extraordinarily good
                            teamwork.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_392" n="392" facs="0416"/>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> asked to be
                            heard, and stated his agreement with the President that any small
                            modification upward of the proposed budget would probably not greatly
                            enhance our defensive capabilities against the Soviet Union. What we
                            must really try hard to do was to open up the Soviet Union. The
                            forthcoming year would provide the United States with the best
                            opportunity to date to open up the Soviet Union. On the other hand, if
                            we tried to drastically raise the levels of the U.S. defense budget, the
                            Soviet Union might be led to conclude that war was inevitable and act
                            accordingly.</p>
                        <p>The President stated that this reminded him that he wished to disagree
                            with Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>’s statement
                            at the beginning of the discussion, that the likelihood of war was now
                            increasing. On the contrary, in the President’s opinion the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had taken a worse beating lately than
                            at any time since 1945. Unless Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> meant that war might come from a miscalculation,
                            he was therefore in disagreement with the point of view that the danger
                            of war was increasing.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> replied that in
                            part he had in mind the risk of miscalculation leading to war. He added
                            that if the Soviets continue to have further troubles with their
                            satellites, the United States would have to make up its mind what course
                            of action to follow. The President said he was not impressed by this
                            argument. He believed that the Soviets would be much more likely to
                            worry about having to solidify themselves against satellite unrest. In
                            present circumstances they were not likely to stick their necks out.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> stated, apropos
                            of this exchange of views, that in his opinion we had been witnessing a
                            very drastic and very dramatic deterioration of the position of the
                            Soviet Union in the course of the last two years. The men in the Kremlin
                            do not now exert anything like the influence they exerted two years ago,
                            either over the National Communist Parties outside the Soviet bloc or
                            over the Soviet satellites themselves. Moreover, we can even discern in
                            the Soviet Union itself a rising demand for greater freedom and a more
                            liberal policy. All of this added up to a defeat and a setback for the
                            Soviet rulers. In one sense, of course, this was a highly encouraging
                            development for us. On the other hand, the setbacks of the last two
                            years might call for a terrific effort by the Kremlin to achieve some
                            kind of offsetting success. To achieve this the Soviets might therefore
                            be willing to take risks which could be very dangerous to the free
                            world, since they would be risks born of desperation.</p>
                        <p>The President said the only comment he had on this point was that there
                            was no such thing as a success for any country involved in a major war
                            today. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> expressed
                            agreement, but pointed out the danger that the Soviets might be willing
                            to run risks at the <pb xml:id="pg_393" n="393" facs="0417"/>present
                            time that they would have been unwilling to run two years ago. The
                            President said that of course we must remain on the alert every single
                            minute.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired whether there were any remaining questions or
                            comments. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> stated
                            that he believed that a review of the subversive war was long overdue,
                            and that the subject should come up for discussion early in the next
                            year. As an example of dangerous developments, he pointed to the
                            intelligence from Laos to the effect that the Pathet Lao people were
                            about to be integrated into the Royal Government and the Royal Army. The
                            President said that Nehru had expressed anxiety over this development in
                            his recent conversations,<note n="5" xml:id="d101fn5">Prime Minister
                                Nehru of India made an official visit to the United States December
                                16–20.</note> and asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> if the Indian Prime Minister had referred to the
                            same danger in his talks with the Secretary of State. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that Nehru had
                            also raised this question with him, and added that he wondered if we had
                            not been a little too strong in our indication to the Government of Laos
                            that the taking in of any Pathet Lao people into the government would
                            result in the cessation of all American assistance. This statement had
                            been perhaps a little too strong, but it was apparently the hope of the
                            Pathet Laos to secure the Ministries of Interior, Defense and Foreign
                            Affairs in the newly integrated government. If the Pathet Lao secured
                            even one of these three key ministries, the fate of Laos would be sealed
                            and it would come under Communist control.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> then suggested
                            that, inasmuch as the budget cycle for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1959 would commence soon, it would be desirable to use the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 personnel strengths, force levels
                            and dollar figures as the basis for planning for the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959 military program and budget.
                            Modifications could subsequently be made with respect to this planning
                            basis if circumstances so dictated. The President indicated approval of
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s suggestion.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> followed this
                            suggestion with a question to the President as to whether he thought
                            that the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 military program, as it
                            had been presented in the morning’s discussion, was generally
                            satisfactory. The President replied that the Defense Department program
                            for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 was acceptable to him.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of the meeting, the President warmly thanked those who
                            had briefed him and the Council on the military program for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958.<note n="6" xml:id="d101fn6">In a
                                memorandum dated December 31, <persName corresp="#p_GCAJ1">Goodpaster</persName>, on behalf of the President, requested
                                the Chiefs of Staff and the Military Secretaries to confirm the
                                following statement, to be used in the President’s remarks to
                                Congressional leaders on January 1, 1957:<p>“Each of the Chiefs of
                                    Staff and each of the Secretaries has given his views on this
                                    military program.</p>
                                <p>“Although individual service Chiefs have pointed out specific

                                    would be desirable, each Chief and Secretary has indicated that
                                    he considers a program of this magnitude—viewed as a
                                    whole—well-balanced and satisfactory.</p>
                                <p>“Each one has assured the President that he can and will give the
                                    program his wholehearted support, as involving an acceptable
                                    degree of risk and providing a reasonable and wise degree of

                            Chiefs of Staff to obtain their confirmation of its accuracy. They
                            confirmed that the statement was correct. Several had comments relating
                            to it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said there would be no
                            problem if the President were willing to say that he set the “ceiling.”
                            I indicated that as I understood the process, the President had not set
                            a ceiling, but had decided upon a figure between the present program and
                            the one proposed, after considering and discussing the main elements of
                            the program. I understood the position to be that of course he would say
                            that the determination is his, but wished to know and to state that the
                            others join him in it.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_BWM1">Brucker</persName> emphasized the
                            need which he foresaw next year for added funds for post and station
                            maintenance, and asked if this feeling on his part impaired his
                            concurrence with the President’s draft statement. I told him that it
                            would seem to do so, if he held this view as a condition to concurring
                            in the statement, but not if he holds it as an intent to press the
                            matter strongly next year, but with confidence that the outcome decided
                            on next year will be a sound one. He said he was inclined to regard it
                            as the latter.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> discussed and
                            studied at length the reference to the program as “well-balanced and
                            satisfactory.” He wondered whether the first part of that sentence and
                            the last part were not in contradiction; I told him that, as I
                            understood the matter, a Chief or a Secretary might feel that there were
                            areas he would like to have strengthened in his own service, in some
                            cases in order to have certain operational capabilities in his own
                            service, but that he might recognize that the program balanced out this
                            deficiency with capabilities provided in other services—or that even
                            taking into account the deficiency, the resulting over-all military
                            capability is consistent with acceptable risk and reasonable security
                            for the United States. He said that he would interpret these words in
                            the sense of “sound over-all,” accepting that this expression included
                            “satisfactory over-all.” He accepted that the program is well balanced
                            as regards use of the resources made available to the Air Force. He said
                            that the statement goes further than he has up to this point obtained
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName>’s endorsement
                            (he did not indicate that he had sought General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName>’s <pb xml:id="pg_396" n="396" facs="0420"/>endorsement for going this far); he said that his
                            actions should not in any sense be understood to commit or represent
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName>’s view— General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> would have an
                            independent reaction to offer. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> gave assurance of his loyal acceptance of the
                            President’s judgment as to this program as a wise and reasonable one and
                            of his own loyal performance in supporting it. He had asked whether his
                            responsibility with regard to the passage concerning degree of risk and
                            degree of security was simply to be willing to accept the President’s
                            judgment in the matter, and I indicated that as I would understand the
                            matter, it would be a question of exercising his own judgment on these
                            matters insofar as he felt capable of doing so, and finding his own
                            judgment consistent with the President’s and then feeling confidence in
                            the President’s judgment on matters he felt to be outside his own
                            competence. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> said he
                            was in position to sign the statement after this discussion.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> asked what his
                            signature would imply with regard to answering questions asked of him in
                            the Congress, and referred to various points in the budget which are
                            “soft” or “weak” from the Army’s standpoint. I told him that I
                            understood the matter to be considered basically one of attitude, and
                            that if these points were explained while maintaining adherence to the
                            soundness of the budget and program over-all—and not as a means and with
                            the intent of breaking down the budget—that the action would be
                            consistent with his signature.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> had no comment on
                            the memorandum. Secretary Thomas, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_PLGRM1">Pate</persName> expressed strong concurrence. The latter said he
                            planned to have his Legislative Liaison people ask key members of
                            Congress to try to avoid “embarrassing” questions about the budget,
                            i.e., those which would tend to break it down.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSJ1">Lay</persName> asked the President and
                            the Council whether they wished now to consider the definition by the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff of the term “limited initial resistance”. The
                            President replied that he had read such definitions over a long period
                            of years, and hadn’t on the whole found them very helpful. He then read
                            to himself the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> memo<note n="4" xml:id="d103fn4">The memorandum from the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> to the Secretary of Defense, dated December 21,

                            distributed to the members of the Council at the beginning of the
                            meeting (covered by the reference memorandum of January 2). Upon
                            finishing the memorandum, the President commented that he had “nothing
                            against it”. He then went on to observe that what we ought to do with
                            these underdeveloped countries was, in the first place, to see that by
                            virtue of our military assistance program these countries have forces
                            strong enough to assure internal stability. Thereafter it should be the
                            objective of our program to see that they have sufficient forces to
                            prevent enemy infiltration of their borders, and perhaps a small
                            resistance force. That, however, was about the limit. In Pakistan we had
                            certainly gone much too far, the more so because attacks by the Soviet
                            Union will not be made on these countries in isolated fashion. Nor would
                            the United States ever be likely to fight in India or in Pakistan. If we
                            have to fight, we will fight in Moscow in order not to have to fight in
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> warned the
                            Council that we would never get out of our financial and economic
                            troubles in connection with our assistance programs until we genuinely
                            revised the objectives of our national security policies vis-à-vis the
                            different foreign countries.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> expressed the opinion
                            that the definition by the Joint Chiefs of Staff of “limited initial
                            resistance” seemed “pretty good” to him, though he had some
                            qualifications on the time span of 45 days.</p>
                        <p>The President stated that personally he could scarcely imagine the United
                            States getting deeply involved in war in South Asia with ground forces.
                            The area was simply too peripheral to our vital interests. [<hi rend="italic">1 sentence (35 words) not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>The President commented, with respect to the discussion of money, that
                            Prime Minister Nehru had not talked money with him at all in the course
                            of his visit.<note n="5" xml:id="d103fn5">Prime Minister Nehru of India

                            There was much that was still unclear about Nehru’s policies, but the
                            President said that at the end of his conversations with Nehru he was at
                            least sure of one thing: Nehru did not want Russia running his
                            country.</p>

                            MECHANISM CAN EFFECTIVELY SERVE THE PRESIDENT</p>
                        <p>1. The National Security Council should be the channel through which
                            recommendations for national security policy reach the President for his
                            decision.</p>
                        <p>a. The policy of the President is not permanently to assign an area of
                            national security policy formulation as the responsibility of a
                            department, agency, or individual outside the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> mechanism.</p>
                        <p>b. The President should make decisions on national security policy—except
                            in special cases of urgency—within the framework of the Council.</p>
                        <p>2. Except in special cases of urgency, security policy recommendations by
                            the Council to the President should be based on written papers:</p>
                        <p>a. prepared by the Council’s Planning Board in deliberations at which the
                            views of all affected departments and agencies are sought, debated, and
                            integrated;</p>
                        <p>b. circulated to and studied, in advance of the Council meeting, by those
                            to attend that meeting;</p>
                        <p>c. discussed by the Council at a meeting presided over by the
                            President.</p>
                        <p>3. To assure that security policy recommendations for Council
                            consideration are of high quality:</p>
                        <p>a. the Special Assistant for National Security Affairs, Chairman of the
                            Planning Board, should participate in the Board’s deliberations;</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_400" n="400" facs="0424"/>
                        <p>b. each Planning Board Member should be recommended to the President by
                            his department or agency chief, approved by the Special Assistant for
                            National Security Affairs, and appointed by the President;</p>
                        <p>c. the stature and abilities of the Planning Board Members must meet the
                            same standard required for Assistant Secretary; their attendance at all
                            regular Planning Board meetings should be required; and their alternates
                            should be of high competence;</p>
                        <p>d. each department and agency should change its Planning Board Member
                            about every third year in order to bring fresh points of view into
                            Planning Board deliberations.</p>
                        <p>4. To make the agenda and operations of the Council responsive to current
                            needs:</p>
                        <p>a. except as directed by the President, matters to be considered by the
                            Council should insofar as possible deal with the making or alteration of
                                <hi rend="italic">broad policies</hi>—either policies for the future
                            or policies immediately required by currently developing events—and with
                            reports on the <hi rend="italic">progress of carrying out approved
                                policies</hi>. The Council does not concern itself with inter-agency
                            conflicts not involving policy considerations;</p>
                        <p>b. papers submitted by the Planning Board for Council consideration
                            should be shortened and sharpened. Each should include: a concise
                            statement of the general considerations on which the policy
                            recommendations are based; a succinct statement of long-range and
                            short-range objectives; clear policy conclusions on major issues (but
                            not a routine listing of courses of action); a brief indication of
                            financial implications (but not detailed financial appendices);</p>
                        <p>c. fresh consideration should be given to the use of qualified,
                            representative civilian Consultants—individually or as committees— for
                            particular tasks;</p>
                        <p>d fresh consideration should be given to the number of people authorized
                            by the President to attend Council meetings.</p>
                        <p>5. Because the Operations Coordinating Board is a valuable mechanism for
                            coordinating the planning of responsible departments and agencies under
                            approved national security policies and of following up their
                            performance thereunder, the office space of the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> has been juxtaposed to the office space of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Staff; and the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss>:</p>
                        <p>a. should be brought by Executive Order within the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> structure;</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robert Cutler</persName>, newly
                            reappointed Special Assistant to the President for National Security
                            Affairs, explained the nature of this agenda item, and called on
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>. The latter in
                            turn introduced Dr. E. V. Murphree, Special Assistant to the Secretary
                            of Defense on the missiles programs. Dr. Murphree indicated that he
                            would make some general comments on the long-range ballistic missiles
                            programs and would leave the details of each program to be treated
                            subsequently by the representatives of the three Military Services. (The
                            reports of Dr. Murphree and the Service representatives are filed in the
                            minutes of the meeting.)<note n="3" xml:id="d105fn3">The reports are
                                filed in the minutes.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Dr. Murphree stated that, thanks to significant technical advances in the
                            course of the year 1956, the outlook for success in achieving the
                            objectives of the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> programs was much more promising. He
                            reminded the members of the Council that by determination of the
                            Secretary of Defense, the Air Force was to have operational
                            responsibility for the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> and for the
                            land-based <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>. The Navy was to have
                            operational responsibility for the ship-based <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Murphree went on to indicate the considerable differences between the
                            two <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> missiles, Atlas and Titan,
                            which were in the course of being developed. It was the present plan of
                            the Defense Department to carry both the Atlas and the Titan programs to
                            the point at which an initial operational capability would have been
                            achieved with both missiles. He stated that the serious problem of
                            reentry <pb xml:id="pg_402" n="402" facs="0426"/>showed every likelihood
                            of being solved, although, of course, we had no actual flight data as
                            yet and would not have such data until next year.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>, Dr. Murphree
                            said there were likewise two different missiles in the course of
                            development, the Jupiter and the Thor. The first flight tests of the
                                <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> would occur in the very near
                            future. It ought to be possible by the end of the calendar year 1957 to
                            tell which of these two missiles was the more promising. But due to the
                            great importance and urgency of achieving an <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> capability, the Defense Department had decided to
                            carry both the Thor and Jupiter programs forward through the calendar
                            year 1957. Thereafter the move effective missile program would be
                            carried forward and the other dropped.</p>
                        <p>After a brief comment on the estimated future costs of these missiles
                            programs, Dr. Murphree indicated that it was the hope of the Defense
                            Department that the British would build bases for the <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> in the United Kingdom and would
                            assume operational responsibility for the <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>. From a number of points of view the British Isles
                            offered the most advantageous location for <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> bases.</p>
                        <p>After a brief comment on the development of Soviet long-range ballistic
                            missiles capabilities, Dr. Murphree indicated that the representatives
                            of the Services would discuss these programs in greater detail. The
                            first report would be on the Air Force program, which would be presented
                            by General Schriever.</p>
                        <p>With the aid of slides, General Schriever first discussed the “<gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> Development Timetable”. He was also
                            optimistic with respect to the likelihood of a solution of the re-entry
                            problem, basing his judgment on tests conducted to date and practically
                            terminated at this point. It was the Air Force’s hope to have the first
                            operational <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> ready at a date early
                            in 1959.</p>
                        <p>General Schriever then indicated the major difference between the Atlas
                            1½-stage missile and the 2-stage Titan missile. In so doing he was
                            assisted by models of these missiles which had been brought to the
                            Cabinet Room. He predicted that the first launching of the flight test
                            missile Atlas would occur in the course of 1957. The first guided flight
                            of an Atlas missile was likely to occur in 1958. The corresponding dates
                            for tests of the Titan missile would be approximately one year behind
                            the similar developments on Atlas.</p>
                        <p>Thereafter, and again with the aid of slides, General Schriever outlined
                            the “Initial Operational Capability Force Build-up”. He noted that the
                            program called for the first three launchers to be operational by the
                            spring of 1959. The ultimate objective of the program was eight
                            squadrons of missiles, four Atlas and four Titan.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_403" n="403" facs="0427"/>
                        <p>General Schriever then turned to the Air Force <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> program which was developing the Thor missile. As in
                            the case of the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>, General Schriever
                            outlined in the first instance the <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>
                            initial operational capability force build-up. He stated that the first
                            launching of the Thor missile should come very soon in the current
                            calendar year. The first guided flights of the Thor missile would occur
                            in August 1957. Turning to the operational aspects of the <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> program, General Schriever noted that
                            current plans involved three phases. The first phase consisted of the
                            achievement of an emergency capability for the <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> in the United Kingdom by February 1958. Six missiles
                            should be in existence by mid-1958, and four squadrons by 1960.</p>
                        <p>General Schriever noted that the foregoing arrangements still require
                            high-level approval and, of course, negotiations between the United
                            States and the United Kingdom. General Schriever closed his remarks with
                            a summary in which he stated that the Air Force believed that we were
                            now entering upon the most critical phase in the development of our
                            missiles—namely, the testing phase. In all essentials the program was on
                            schedule, and the Air Force felt confident that we would achieve the
                            objectives of the program within the time limits which had been set.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of General Schriever’s report, Dr. Murphree requested
                            General Medaris to report on the Army’s <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> program. General Medaris stated that the missile being
                            developed under this program was called the Jupiter, with a range of
                            1500 nautical miles. There had been ten firings in 1956 of missiles of a
                            Jupiter configuration, but the first complete Jupiter missile would be
                            fired in February 1957. General Medaris expressed confidence that the
                            Army <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> program would demonstrate an
                            emergency capability soon after October 1957. The program was on
                            schedule.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Murphree indicated that Admiral Raborn would discuss the Navy’s
                                <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> program. Admiral Raborn
                            referred initially to the change in the Navy program, which was now
                            concentrating on the development of a missile called Polaris. This was a
                            smaller weapon, with a solid fuel propellant instead of the liquid fuel
                            propellant. This missile was thought much more suitable for sea-based
                            missiles than the others. It was smaller; it had lower costs and greater
                            safety; it was a 1500-mile range missile. The initial testing could be
                            expected in 1961 and the first launching from a submarine in 1962.
                            Admiral Raborn was likewise optimistic as to the prospects for success
                            in completing the Navy <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> program
                            within the time limits originally set.</p>
                        <p>At this point in the presentation, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> said he wished to raise a point with respect to
                            the earlier Council actions regarding the ballistic missiles programs.
                            It was his understanding that the object of these programs was the
                            achievement of a research and development capability for the missiles,
                            but that there had been no authorization to <pb xml:id="pg_404" n="404" facs="0428"/>date by the President for the creation of force units
                            and inventories of missiles along the lines described by the previous
                            speakers. He asked the President if this was not also his impression,
                            and the President stated that he did agree with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>’s interpretation. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> argued, however, that
                            it would be very difficult for the planners to proceed with the
                            development of the missiles if they were to have no reasonable assurance
                            that these missiles would enter our weapons inventory at some future
                            date. Moreover, he was sure that before long we should have to face
                            squarely the question of creating a real operational capability for the
                            ballistic missile.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Murphree indicated that the final presentation by the Department of
                            Defense on the missiles program would be given by his Deputy, Admiral
                            Sides, who would discuss the status of developments of a defense against
                            ballistic missiles. Admiral Sides stated initially that the Defense
                            Department had concluded that an effective defense against ballistic
                            missiles was technically feasible. Secondly, it concluded that the
                            achievement of such a defense would require a complete new weapons and
                            warning system. Thus, radars would be required which do not now exist.
                            These radars would have to be powered by atomic energy. A network to
                            provide warning would cost approximately $1.1 billion. It was estimated
                            that such a warning network would provide an average of some 15 minutes
                            of warning of the approach of a missile to its target. Admiral Sides
                            then answered the question as to how important was such a brief interval
                            of warning. With this 15 minutes, he stated, it would be possible for
                            approximately one-third of our <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>
                            planes to be got off the ground and into the air. This interval would
                            permit warning to planes in the air not to land at their bases. Millions
                            of lives might be spared if in this 15 minutes citizens in target areas
                            could get into some kind of shelter. It would be possible also for the
                            alert status of <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> to be improved.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President commented on the emphasis which the Navy program put
                            on missiles to be launched from submarines. We must assume, he said,
                            that Soviet development is paralleling our own. If this is indeed the
                            case, what would be involved in a missile program to defend our coasts
                            against attack from Soviet submarines carrying ballistic missiles?
                            Admiral Sides replied that in view of the extended length of the U.S.
                            coastline, there would be enormous costs involved in achieving the means
                            of protecting these coasts against such a threat.</p>

                            customary, called on the Secretary of the Treasury for any comment he
                            wished to make.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> commenced by
                            stating that the members of the National Security Council had heard from
                            him so often on this subject that they all must be thoroughly sick and
                            tired of it. Nevertheless, he felt he must say that every single
                            individual in this room carried a responsibility for determining what
                            this Government should spend and how we should spend it. This
                            determination was essentially more the job of the military departments
                            than it was of the Treasury and the Budget. We must also admit that
                            neither the military on their side nor Treasury and Budget on theirs,
                            really knew very much what they were talking about. Defense is hard put
                            to it to produce reliable information as to what this country needs at
                            any given time for an adequate national defense. On the other hand, the
                            Treasury was unable to say for sure just how much money this country is
                            in a position to spend in the future before we go broke. Accordingly,
                            the problem was one of balancing two sets of unknowns. It seemed to
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> that what we
                            must do is to achieve a much higher degree <pb xml:id="pg_406" n="406" facs="0430"/>of selectivity in our national expenditures. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> illustrated this
                            point by reference to the missiles presentation which had been heard
                            earlier. Here we were, he said, engaged in spending billions of dollars
                            to achieve a ballistic missile. At the same time we were spending other
                            billions to produce aircraft like the B–52, early warning systems, etc.,
                            etc.; yet if these ballistic missiles really work, the early warning
                            network would be overflown by the enemy and rendered useless. So how we
                            get together all these considerations and make a selective choice in our
                            expenditure—this was primarily the task of the Defense Department. The
                            Defense people must decide what is generally in the national security
                            interest for us to have in the way of defense. We could not continue to
                            take billions of dollars from the pockets of our people while affirming
                            our belief that our international position is generally a great deal
                            better than it has been and that there is very little likelihood of
                            war.</p>
                        <p>To continue spending on the scale that we have been spending, said
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, would entail
                            two very serious risks. The first one was that our people would rebel
                            and refuse to stand for a continuation of such large expenditures. The
                            second risk was that we might well overreach ourselves in our spending
                            and thus again run into bad times. Accordingly, the only solution was
                            more selective spending. Nor was it good enough simply to try to hold
                            government spending at present levels. On the contrary, these levels
                            must be brought down. In order to make a beginning of this, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said he had just one
                            suggestion to make. The Departments of State and Defense should give a
                            great deal more attention to what this Government should do about
                            maintaining such large troop deployments (together with their civilian
                            followers) all over the world. The time was at hand for these two
                            departments to collaborate on the achievement of a radical change and
                            reduction in this situation.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> replied by
                            stating that the Department of Defense found itself caught in the middle
                            between the needs of national defense on the one hand and the
                            availability of resources on the other. In this situation, if we hope to
                            make any substantial cuts in our expenditures we would certainly have to
                            change and reduce our commitments and our activities. In point of fact,
                            moreover, the Defense Department had in recent years made many savings,
                            despite the Budget figures which had just been presented. Even now the
                            Defense Department was reconsidering the deployment of U.S. forces
                            abroad and other Defense Department activities, because we could not
                            possibly remain in our present frozen position if we are ever to achieve
                            the savings objectives about which the Secretary of the Treasury had
                            been speaking.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_407" n="407" facs="0431"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> expressed
                            agreement with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>
                            on this latter point, and stated that we are indeed “out of line”. If we
                            were ever to get back into line, we must be willing to incur certain
                            risks. The troublesome question was which risks to run. If the Democrats
                            were smart, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, and some of them were smart—they will soon be
                            turning up in the public mind as the economy boys and the balancers of
                            the budget. The Republicans would be put down as the true
                            spendthrifts.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> asked if he might
                            now be heard. When the President indicated that he had the floor,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he
                            fully shared the views of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> on the importance of avoiding unnecessary
                            expenditures. Certainly some expenditures could be reduced by this
                            Government without incurring unacceptable risks to the national
                            security. For example, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, he was very dubious about the distant early
                            warning (<gloss target="#t_DEW1">DEW</gloss>) line and some of our
                            continental defense programs. The <gloss target="#t_DEW1">DEW</gloss>
                            line was something of a Maginot Line idea and, as the missiles
                            presentation earlier suggested, such lines could be overflown. Perhaps
                            likewise in Korea, Japan and Germany there were U.S. programs which
                            involved unnecessary U.S. expenditures. While, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, he thought it quite unlikely
                            that the United States would ever become engaged in a war with the
                            Soviet Union along the lines suggested by the report of the Net
                            Evaluation Subcommittee a couple of weeks ago, he did think that if the
                            United States were ever to get into a military posture inferior to that
                            of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, this country would suffer
                            defeat without the occurrence of a war. He said he would illustrate the
                            point of his remark by reference to the game of chess. In a chess game
                            you wouldn’t normally ever go so far as to take your opponent’s king;
                            you checkmate that king and don’t play out the rest.</p>
                        <p>Now, if the Soviet Union should ever get itself in a position where it
                            could checkmate the United States, the Soviet Union would never have to
                            resort to war in order to destroy the United States. We would be obliged
                            to give in. And in a sense, continued Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, a war with the Soviet Union is
                            being fought by the United States at the present time. Thus in our
                            recent thinking about what we ought to do with respect to this terrible
                            situation in the Middle East, we anticipated and counted on a
                            significant Soviet reaction and challenge to our new proposals. We will
                            get such a challenge. Nevertheless, we felt that we could accept this
                            forthcoming challenge because Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> had stated that our own military establishment
                            was superior to Russia’s and that the Russians knew that it was
                            superior. Thus, if necessary, we could call checkmate on the Soviet
                            Union.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_408" n="408" facs="0432"/>
                        <p>In view of all this, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he thought that we would have to bear in
                            mind that while these terrible missiles which we have heard described
                            this morning might never be used, they are nevertheless essential to the
                            national security. We simply cannot afford to be inferior to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>In closing, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            stressed that there was no incompatibility between what he was saying
                            and what Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> had
                            been saying. All that was required was that the two views be got
                            together. In any event, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> felt that what he had said formed an important
                            part of the total picture.</p>
                        <p>At the end of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’
                            statement, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> reminded
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> that he would
                            surely want to say something about the problematical nature of the
                            projected increase in the Treasury’s receipts in the next fiscal year.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said he agreed
                            emphatically that the likelihood of such an increase was far from
                            certain.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> stated that he
                            and his military advisers all felt that this Government was already
                            skating dangerously close to losing that superiority over the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> of which Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had just spoken. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> also said that in his
                            opinion this country had never been so prosperous as it was at the
                            present time. Accordingly, if we needed to spend all that we were now
                            spending in order to maintain our military superiority over the Soviet
                            Union, he believed that our country could well afford the
                            expenditure.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that he
                            agreed with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> that
                            there was certainly no immediate threat to the health of the U.S.
                            economy; but such a threat could develop in the future if we go on
                            spending at the present rate. Perhaps, added Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, what we are facing is an
                            absolute necessity for disarmament. Of course, if we have to maintain
                            this expensive defense posture and go broke, it would be just too bad;
                            we would have to go broke. However, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> again called for greater
                            selectivity in our spending, and added his belief that all our national
                            security policies ought to be reviewed now “from the guts up”.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> commented that
                            his people kept saying that even present expenditures will not provide
                            the United States with the military strength that it ought to have.
                            About the only comfort he could derive from the situation was his belief
                            that the burden of armaments on the Russian people was even worse.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> said that he
                            would like to make one point with respect to the views of Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>. He would like to
                            suggest a study which might conceivably prove fruitful. He referred to
                            some of the major increases in our military effectiveness in the <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">shape</gloss> of missiles, atomic weapons, and
                            the like. In view of this increase in our fire power, perhaps it would
                            be profitable to conduct a study which might <pb xml:id="pg_409" n="409" facs="0433"/>lead to a more rapid phase-out of certain categories of
                            weapons which are becoming slightly obsolescent. Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> said he had in mind fighter
                            bombers, medium bombers, aircraft carriers, and front line
                            divisions.</p>
                        <p>As the Council was about to adjourn, the President said he had one point
                            to make. It seemed to him, he said, that some world problems are
                            insoluble. For instance, that is what we are getting up against with the
                            advent of these ballistic missiles which had been described earlier. War
                            had always been hitherto a contest, but it was preposterous to describe
                            a war of missiles as a contest. The President added that he believed
                            that there was already in the world all the deterrent power that could
                            be used. That is, there was enough deterrent power so that each side
                            could destroy the other side completely. The concept of deterrent power
                            has gone as far as it can. In view of this incredible situation we must
                            have more fresh thinking on how to conduct ourselves. We must also
                            educate our European allies. At least they have now come to desire
                            atomic weapons in their defense arsenals. But in any case, over the long
                            run this country must get to a point where we can stabilize at least on
                            a percentage basis of the gross national product to be devoted to our
                            defense. Everyone who professes to be seriously concerned with the
                            future of our country must do some fresh thinking. We cannot continue
                            along our present line of thinking and acting without “busting”
                            ourselves.</p>

                            with the following comments:</p>
                        <p>“The Director of Central Intelligence informed the Council that on the
                                [<hi rend="italic">remainder of paragraph (8 lines of source text)

                        <p>“Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> then provided certain statistics
                            regarding the Soviet guided missile program. He stated that as of [<hi rend="italic">25 words not declassified</hi>]. Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> added his estimate of what the Soviet
                            Union might have now and might be estimated to have in the future in the
                            way of missile capability.</p>
                        <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> commented that
                            as of the present time the Defense Department was not attempting to
                            produce any missiles in the range of 300 to 700 miles, for the very good
                            reason that we did not know what we could do with a missile of this
                            ranee if we succeeded in producing one. Nevertheless, this matter should
                            be kept under study. Moreover, as for the 1500-mile intermediate range
                            ballistic missile, even this missile did not look very valuable to the
                            Defense Department unless we were sure of getting the cooperation of our
                            allies in the matter of providing launching sites for ballistic missiles
                            of this approximate range.” (Memorandum of discussion; Eisenhower

                        <p>The following material consists of excerpts from an oral briefing offered
                            Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> at the Pentagon
                            on Friday, January 25, which it seems appropriate to make of record.
                            Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> was accompanied
                            by Deputy Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>.
                            The statements recorded below are reported principally from the
                            presentation in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gordon Gray</persName>’s
                            office by Mr. Charles Sullivan, Director of the Office of Special
                            International Affairs.</p>
                        <p>1. The Defense Department considers that atomic capability is a definite
                            part of our military armor today. While we should be restrained in our
                            publicity and should not go about flexing our muscles, we should not
                            hide this fact of atomic power. The success of the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> maneuver, Operation Firm Link, at
                            Bangkok last year is a case in point.<note n="2" xml:id="d107fn2">Regarding Operation Firm link, see vol. XXI, pp. 177–179.</note>
                            Honest <persName>John</persName> rockets with conventional warheads were
                            used in that operation. Despite serious concern beforehand over reaction
                            in Asia to this step, the operation was highly successful and there was
                            no adverse publicity anywhere except, as to be expected, in the
                            communist <pb xml:id="pg_411" n="411" facs="0435"/>press. Failure to
                            include atomic capability openly in our military posture would in
                            Defense opinion raise doubts in Asian minds as to the firmness of U.S.
                            intentions to defend our Asian partners.</p>
                        <p>2. With respect to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, reported UK
                            plans to cut its forces in half could have very serious
                                consequences.<note n="3" xml:id="d107fn3">For the British
                                announcement of reductions in their armed forces, see <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi>, April 5, 1957, pp. 1 and
                                4.</note> Such reductions might well start a steady erosion of
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces. There is even some
                            feeling in the Pentagon that U.S. forces assigned to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> could be deeply cut. The prevailing
                            Defense viewpoint is that the UK cannot cut its forces, even with the
                            intent to restore the balance with atomic weapons, and maintain the same
                            strength. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> strength measured
                            against <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> commitments is already at
                            rock bottom.</p>
                        <p>3. There is encouraging progress in new weapons, both in U.S. capacity to
                            produce and supply such weapons and in our allies’ capacity to absorb
                            them in their military structures and employ them. [<hi rend="italic">2

                        <p>4. The problem of operating bases in foreign countries is a constant
                            preoccupation. The U.S. now has base rights in 38 countries, and
                            negotiations involving some aspect of base rights are presently going on
                            in some 20 countries. Exaggerated nationalism and constantly rising
                            demands for increased payments and other forms of U.S. aid in exchange
                            for base rights are coming to raise serious questions in some areas as
                            to whether a given base is worth its cost both in financial terms and in
                            terms of deteriorating U.S. relations.</p>
                        <p>The dollar worth of a base is difficult to estimate, although Defense
                            attempts to calculate it on a completely pragmatic basis. What we are
                            willing to pay to obtain a base depends in some measure on our
                            investment already there (we have put $70 million into the Dhahran air
                            base of which $20-25 million worth could be moved out if we should give
                            it up) and is affected greatly by other bases which we may have in the
                            same general area.<note n="4" xml:id="d107fn4">For documentation on the
                                Dhahran airbase, see vol. XIII, pp. 249 ff.</note> For instance, the
                            price we were willing to pay in connection with the recent five-year
                            extension agreement with Libya was keyed to our knowledge that the
                            financial terms of any agreement are quickly known in other
                                countries.<note n="5" xml:id="d107fn5">For documentation on the

                            the Libyan base and the Dhahran air base in Saudi Arabia, Dhahran is
                            more expendable. With respect to Morocco, the Moroccans have been
                            talking in terms of a total of about $430 million in payments and aid.
                            It is anticipated that this unrealistic amount can be substantially
                            scaled <pb xml:id="pg_412" n="412" facs="0436"/>down in the

                            already the Spaniards are asking for more.<note n="7" xml:id="d107fn7">Documentation on the Spanish bases is scheduled for publication in

                            thinking in Defense is toward avoiding the use of high level missions
                            from Washington in the future. Special representatives of high rank for
                            negotiating purposes invariably results in the host country setting its
                            sights higher and demanding a larger price. The recent Philippine
                            negotiations offer an outstanding example of this point.<note n="8" xml:id="d107fn8">For documentation on the Philippine negotiations,

                            would profit through the development in the Defense Department of a
                            small group of personnel highly qualified in the business of base
                            negotiations. Individuals from this group would be available for

                            office, the dilemma of thermonuclear power was touched on. If we have
                            nuclear weapons of such enormous power that we fear to use them because
                            of the consequences which might ensue, and if our enemy knows that we
                            fear to use our power because of the danger of the consequences, then
                            what is the real value of that power as an arm of diplomacy? There was
                            also discussed the other horn of the dilemma—the increasing economic
                            pressures and inflationary dangers at home flowing from the staggering
                            cost of modem day defense equipment.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName> to express his point
                            of view.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName> stated that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> had expressed his,
                            Governor <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName>’s, views as
                            fairly as he had stated those of the Planning Board. He said he did feel
                            that the Planning Board description of the program as something of a
                            “gimmick” was rather gratuitous. Indeed, it was a flippancy which was
                            wholly unnecessary, because there was nothing abnormal in the program
                            which had been proposed by the Panel as a means of bringing home to the
                            American people the character of a future nuclear conflict.</p>
                        <p>With respect to his own proposal that the program should be placed in
                            charge of a newly created Special Assistant to the President, Governor
                                <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName> said that perhaps the
                            Federal Civil Defense Administration had leaned backwards a little on
                            itself assuming responsibility for the program. In point of fact, <gloss target="#t_FCDA1">FCDA</gloss> believed that a Special Assistant
                            could do a better job in heading this program because of the prestige
                            which a Presidential Special Assistant would inevitably lend <pb xml:id="pg_414" n="414" facs="0438"/>to it. Nevertheless, if there
                            were a decision against creating a Special Assistant to head the
                            program, the Federal Civil Defense Administration would gladly and
                            gracefully accept the responsibility. Governor <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName> closed his remarks by stating
                            that despite all the difficulties which the Planning Board had perceived
                            in the Panel’s proposed program, the basic problem still remained to
                            confront us—namely, that if nuclear war were to occur we could expect
                            the disintegration of the nation if the American public were not better
                            prepared to face such a war than is now the case.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that the crux of the matter lay in the Panel’s
                            central conclusion that “a massive nuclear attack on the United States
                            resulting in casualties of the order of 50,000,000 without drastically
                            improved preparation of the people, would jeopardize support of the
                            national government and of the war effort, and might well result in
                            national disintegration.” This was a terrible kind of problem which we
                            could not solve with our current military planning, for example, by
                            talking of maintaining six divisions abroad. Speaking with great
                            feeling, the President explained the background of his request that the
                            Panel undertake this study. He went on to point out that the findings of
                            the Panel had a very definite effect on our war plans. If the conclusion
                            he had quoted above was a correct conclusion, the sensible thing for the
                            United States to do in its war planning was to concentrate on what
                            measures we should undertake in the first week of the war. It would all
                            be over by that time. But in point of fact, we ignore this and continue
                            to develop elaborate and long-range plans for prosecuting a future war
                            in which we would be involved. If the views of the Panel are correct, we
                            should certainly revise our war plans. The President was not very
                            sympathetic, either, to the view that the carrying out of a large-scale
                            U.S. shelter program would create anxiety in the Soviet Union and
                            suggest to the Soviet Union the likelihood that we were about to
                            undertake a preventive war. If a mere shelter program made the Soviets
                            nervous, what, presumably, did they think about such things as our
                            missiles program? The problem on which the Panel had concentrated its
                            thinking, the President said, was the most serious problem which had
                            ever faced the world.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> again explained the
                            Planning Board view as to the need for more details and a more definite
                            program before the Council gave its blessing to a program of the sort
                            suggested by the Panel. He pointed out that the Planning Board had
                            regarded the Panel’s report as interesting, but did not feel that it had
                            sufficient information as to what the Administration would be getting
                            into if it bought the Panel’s proposed program. After all, said Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>, we do not wish to get
                            involved again in anything like our ill-fated “Operation Candor”.<note n="5" xml:id="d108fn5">Not further identified.</note>

                        <p>With respect to the problem of public information about the effects of
                            nuclear war, the President insisted that he had informed the U.S. public
                            on more than one occasion that if the United States became involved in a
                            nuclear war, North America would in effect become a desert.<note n="6" xml:id="d108fn6">See <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s remarks at the Conference of the

                        <p>The Attorney General expressed the view that in the process of informing
                            the public, more emphasis should be given to discussions with the
                            Governors of the states and the Mayors of our cities, rather than to
                            rely, as the Panel suggested, on an approach to individuals. The
                            approach to local units was the basis for developing our dispersal
                            program, and the Attorney General believed that this was more effective
                            than the mass approach and involvement recommended by the Panel.
                            Governor <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName> replied that
                            both he, in the civil defense program, and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName>, on the dispersal plan, had
                            been trying to move increasingly in the direction pointed out by the
                            Attorney General.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName> called attention
                            to the statement in the body of the report, regarding the consequences
                            of nuclear attack on the United States, that “We have satisfied
                            ourselves that sufficient information has been made available to them
                            [the American people],<note n="7" xml:id="d108fn7">Brackets in the
                                source text.</note> but it has not been successfully conveyed to
                            them and incorporated in their feelings and actions.” Indeed, the
                            President had just said that he himself had repeatedly called the
                            public’s attention to these consequences, and cited excerpts from
                            Presidential speeches. Accordingly, the public certainly had sufficient
                            information. This being the case, the only thing we could expect from
                            the kind of large-scale propaganda program recommended by the Panel
                            would be, on the one hand, panic among our people, and, on the other,
                            terrific pressure by the politicians to undertake a vast shelter
                            program. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName>
                            expressed the opinion that no shelter program would offer an effective
                            solution to the problem of nuclear devastation. On the contrary, by
                            collecting large numbers of people in shelters located near areas under
                            nuclear attack, all we would do would be to assure that these people
                            would be incinerated or suffocated in their shelters.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> stated that the Panel
                            was not recommending anything which could be rightly called a propaganda
                            campaign, but proposed an educational program which would be based on
                            small discussion groups and which would be pitched in a low key
                            precisely to avoid panic and hysteria. Indeed, this was one of the
                            problems that had <pb xml:id="pg_416" n="416" facs="0440"/>worried the
                            Planning Board. They were unable to grasp how we could achieve the
                            desired effects in the public mind if the program was constantly
                            maintained in a low key.</p>
                        <p>The President repeated his view that if we accepted the conclusions that
                            the Panel had reached as to the likelihood of national disintegration if
                            a massive nuclear attack should occur, then we have got to follow a
                            wholly different course of action than we are now following. This
                            conclusion of the Panel stated in effect that this nation would be
                            unable to react after a massive attack with casualties on the order of
                            50,000,000 people. Accordingly, it would seem that the only sensible
                            thing for us to do was to put all our resources into our <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> capability and into hydrogen bombs.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that to
                            him the problem raised by the Panel’s report had two main facets: First,
                            what the Government does with respect to its own planning, and second,
                            what the Government says to the public about its plans. It seemed to
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> altogether
                            foolish to talk about catastrophic effects of nuclear warfare if at the
                            same time we were unable to offer the American public any means and
                            measures which would ameliorate these catastrophic effects. The public
                            was aware of the horrors of nuclear attack. The public has been told
                            about the probable nature of such an attack. Nevertheless, the public
                            simply does not believe that such an attack is going to occur. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> repeated his view
                            that it would do no good for the Administration to scare the public to
                            death as a result of being unable to tell them anything about what we
                            are trying to do to ameliorate the catastrophic effects of a nuclear
                            attack.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he
                            could see no particular objection to the recommendation of the Planning
                            Board that the program proposed by the Panel be studied for another
                            three months. However, it was clear in his own mind that the Government
                            ought never to adopt any such program as the Panel was proposing. We
                            were here involved with a very dangerous and delicate problem which
                            called for our best judgment. In the circumstances, we certainly could
                            not carry out the program proposed by the Panel without creating a mob
                            psychology which would compel us against our better judgment to accept a
                            dangerously faulty disarmament program or else to undertake a vast and
                            costly shelter program. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> did not believe that this country could avoid the
                            perils which the Panel perceived as likely to result from a nuclear
                            attack by creating a world opinion that might force us to do things
                            which we do not want to do and which we think unwise. Instead, we should
                            plan calmly the best measures we can to avert or soften the effects of a
                            nuclear attack.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName> replied that
                            while he appreciated the logic behind Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ statement, we were very likely
                            to be faced with this mob psychology even if we do not undertake the
                            program of <pb xml:id="pg_417" n="417" facs="0441"/>involvement
                            recommended by the Panel. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> insisted that we do not wish to incorporate this
                            kind of information in the minds of our people, as the Panel has
                            recommended.</p>
                        <p>The President broke in and said to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> that in other words the Secretary appeared not to
                            believe in the principle of free government and in giving to the people
                            the kind of information it ought to have. Apart from this, the President
                            pointed out that what had initially got him interested in this problem
                            was the fact that he had observed the evacuations of large cities during
                            the latter years of the second World War. The people were really blind
                            mobs, like a horde of locusts, and completely unmanageable. What the
                            Panel was trying to suggest was that there are certain things we can do
                            which might avoid a repetition of this sort of thing and might enable
                            our people to help themselves more effectively in the event of a
                            terrible attack.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said he still
                            wished to make his point that the Government ought not to scare the
                            people to death by dwelling on the catastrophic results of nuclear war,
                            unless at the same time we are in a position to tell them what to do to
                            meet and counter the situation they would face.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> expressed the
                            view that the points raised earlier by the Attorney General had been
                            very wisely taken. If we followed this recommendation it might well mean
                            the survival of at least local units of government. These could in turn
                            gradually pull the nation together after an attack. He believed that the
                            educational program should stress above all what measures could be taken
                            after an attack to reconstitute society. The President asked Governor
                                <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> for an interpretation
                            of what he was recommending, and suggested that Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> meant that we should not try to
                            assure the survival of all the units of government, but to see that such
                            units as did survive a nuclear attack would know in advance how to
                            proceed with the restoration of some kind of order out of the chaos.
                            Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> indicated that
                            the President’s interpretation of his statement was correct, and that
                            essentially he was advocating steps to assure the decentralized survival
                            of the United States as a nation.</p>
                        <p>At this point, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> expressed
                            the opinion that the discussion in the Council fortified his belief that
                            the recommendations of the Planning Board for Council action had been
                            sound; that is, that no basis for a Council decision with respect to the
                            program recommended by the Panel now existed, but that the matter should
                            receive further study for a matter of three months. The President
                            commented that he had no objection to the recommendations of the
                            Planning Board, but pointed out that he was searching desperately to
                            find the best thing for <pb xml:id="pg_418" n="418" facs="0442"/>us to
                            do at the present time in order to minimize the terrible results of a
                            nuclear attack on the United States, and he was certain that this could
                            not be achieved by simply ignoring the danger.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> said that the
                            matter of timing was a consideration of great importance. As of the
                            present, we had no solution to provide the people, as Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> had pointed out, and
                            it was therefore dangerous to drive home too much the nature of the
                            disaster which they might face. The President agreed that we did have to
                            have something of a positive nature to tell the people, and Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> went on to point
                            out that the Joint Chiefs of Staff were now engaged in studying ways and
                            means of moving our continental defense perimeter out further from our
                            borders.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>2. I believe that the new strategic concept (Appendix A), prepared by the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff and approved by me, provides the basic military
                            planning concept which should govern the planning and development of the
                            U.S. mobilization base. This strategic concept provides for two military
                            eventualities: (a) cold war or military conflict short of general war
                            and (b) general war, initiated with an atomic <pb xml:id="pg_420" n="420" facs="0444"/> onslaught by the Soviets or as a result of
                            hostilities which were not initially intended to lead to general war.
                            The U.S. mobilization base must be fully responsive to these
                            eventualities.</p>
                        <p>3. The introduction of atomic weapons into the military arsenal, and the
                            change which these weapons have made in our strategic concepts of war,
                            dictate a change in logistic planning. In the past, emphasis has been
                            placed on the capability of our industrial facilities to expand for
                            support of our forces in time of war. Our capability of expanding our
                            industrial capabilities was, in fact, an essential element in our U.S.
                            mobilization base. Our experience in past wars made it possible for us
                            to forecast military requirements over an extended period. We were able
                            to economize in times of peace by producing and stockpiling only those
                            military supplies which would be required in war before industrial
                            production could meet the demand. Our time and space advantages were the
                            keys which permitted this type of mobilization planning.</p>
                        <p>4. The present concept concerning the initiation of a general war by a
                            surprise atomic attack eliminates, for all practical purposes, the
                            effect of our previous time and space advantages from mobilization
                            planning. Our concept of the U.S. mobilization base, as related to
                            potential industrial expansion after war commences, must be brought into
                            agreement with this particular aspect of the strategic concept.
                            Pre-D-day planning for mobilization will improve our capabilities to
                            conduct general war. Our U.S. mobilization base should continue to
                            provide for possible peripheral wars both with and without direct
                            participation by U.S. forces. We must develop logistic objectives that
                            are in consonance with our concepts of general war which will restore to
                            the maximum the advantage previously afforded by time and space factors
                            of our geography.</p>
                        <p>5. In consonance with our strategic concept (Appendix A) and Basic
                            National Security Policy, the U.S. mobilization base should at this time
                            be so planned and developed that for both general war and conflict short
                            of general war it will:</p>
                        <p>a. Maintain the active forces in a condition of optimum readiness to
                            execute initial wartime missions.</p>
                        <p>b. Maintain and support selected reserve forces in a condition of high
                            readiness.</p>
                        <p>c. Maintain and support the phased expansion to the M + 6 months force
                            levels.</p>
                        <p>d. Have the capacity to meet the combat requirements of all forces which
                            would be mobilized by M+6 months.</p>
                        <p>e. Provide pre-D-day stocks of selected supplies and equipment outside
                            the United States reasonably protected to insure that those forces
                            surviving the enemy atomic attack will have a reasonable capability of
                            performing assigned initial tasks effectively despite substantial
                            interruption of resupply from the United States during the initial phase
                            of war.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_421" n="421" facs="0445"/>
                        <p>6. In summary the U.S. mobilization base should be predicated on a
                            military planning concept for meeting two distinctively different
                            mobilization problems:</p>
                        <p>a. Conflict without damage to the U.S. production base.</p>
                        <p>b. Conflict characterized by atomic attack on the U.S.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, mobilization planning must be designed to meet the different
                            eventualities outlined above with emphasis on those elements that will
                            increase our D-day readiness and capability.</p>
                        <p>7. Your attention is invited to the fact that, for military planning
                            purposes, the strategic concept provides that in military operations
                            short of general war atomic weapons will be used when required in order
                            to achieve military objectives (Appendix A—para. 2–f, page 8). It is
                            understood, of course, that the actual use of these weapons in such a
                            contingency is dependent upon Presidential authorization as set forth in
                            para. 11 of Basic National Security Policy (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602/1).<note n="3" xml:id="d109fn3">

                            July 1960</p>
                        <p>a. In the event of general war, a war in which the armed forces of the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and of the United States are
                            overtly engaged, the basic military objective of the U.S. Armed Forces
                            is the defeat of the Sino-Soviet Bloc to a degree which will assure the
                            accomplishment of the U.S. national objectives in order to preserve the
                            security of the United States and its fundamental values and
                            institutions. It is the policy of the United States that atomic weapons
                            will be integrated with other weapons in the arsenal of the United
                            States. [<hi rend="italic">1 sentence (18 words) not

                        <pb xml:id="pg_422" n="422" facs="0446"/>
                        <p>b. General war may be initiated either by the Soviets with an atomic
                            onslaught with little or no warning or may be the result of hostilities
                            short of general war which were not initially intended to lead to
                            general war.</p>
                        <p>c. A general war would consist of two phases, an initial phase of
                            comparatively short duration, and a subsequent phase of indeterminate
                            duration. The initial phase would be characterized by an intensive
                            exchange of atomic blows and the initiation of operations and
                            deployments by Army, Naval and Air Force forces designed to achieve
                            strategic advantage. During this period, the U.S. atomic capability
                            would be exploited fully, to the end that enemy military losses and the
                            loss of the war-making capacity directly supporting enemy forces would
                            be such as to either (a) bring about his capitulation or (b) provide a
                            margin of relative advantage to the United States and its Allies
                            sufficient to assure victory in the subsequent phase of operations. This
                            subsequent phase would be a continuation of the initial phase
                            operations, probably at reduced atomic intensity, and follow-up
                            offensive operations to achieve victory and attain Allied war
                            objectives. The ultimate strategy adopted, as well as the duration and
                            outcome of this subsequent phase, will depend largely on the relative
                            advantage achieved in the initial phase and the remaining relative
                            capabilities.</p>
                        <p>d. Prior to the outbreak of a general war which developed as an outgrowth
                            of a local or limited war the United States might achieve a significant
                            degree of mobilization, deployment and commitment of resources. Such
                            deployments might not improve our posture for general war. At any time
                            during hostilities short of general war the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> might initiate a large scale atomic attack, but the
                            alertness of the Allies, the defense preparations and the deployments
                            achieved might reduce casualties to civilian populations and to military
                            forces and establishments from the proportions to be expected in a
                            general war initiated by surprise Soviet atomic attack. However, once a
                            large-scale atomic exchange has taken place, the war situation would
                            probably develop along similar lines to a general war initiated by a
                            surprise atomic attack but with greater Allied capability remaining
                            after the atomic exchange.</p>
                        <p>e. The United States, in collaboration with its Allies, will:</p>
                        <p>(1) Defend the continental United States.</p>
                        <p>(2) Defend vital areas in the Western hemisphere and overseas.</p>
                        <p>(3) Destroy or reduce the military potential of the enemy by conducting
                            offensive operations against the military forces of the enemy and the
                            war-making capacity directly supporting those forces.</p>
                        <p>(4) Conduct operations required to maintain control of essential sea
                            areas and protect vital sea communications.</p>
                        <p>(5) During the initial phase, conduct a strategic defense in Europe, the
                            Middle East and the Far East.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_423" n="423" facs="0447"/>
                        <p>(6) Subsequent to the initial phase, and as dictated by the military
                            situation then existing, conduct such operations as may be required to
                            achieve Allied war objectives. Consequently, only broad guidance in
                            terms of military objectives can now be determined for the conduct of
                            operations in the subsequent phase.</p>
                        <p>(7) Accelerate the phased expansion of all U.S. military forces.</p>

                        <p>a. The basic objective of U.S. national security policy is to preserve
                            the security of the United States and its fundamental values and
                            institutions. During a period of cold war or military conflict short of
                            general war, the Sino-Soviet Bloc regimes can be expected to continue to
                            prosecute through various means an expansionist policy detrimental to
                            the security of the United States and Allies. Military conflict short of
                            general war becomes more likely during this period because of the mutual
                            deterrence to general war resulting from the possession by both sides of
                            the capability to destroy each other even after a surprise attack.
                            Unstable areas of the world, disagreement among nations of the Free
                            World, and fear of atomic destruction will probably offer opportunities
                            for the Sino-Soviet Bloc regimes to exploit subversion and covert or
                            overt armed aggression.</p>
                        <p>b. The United States and its Allies reject the concept of preventive war
                            or acts intended to provoke war. A basic aim of U.S. military policy is
                            to deter the Sino-Soviet Bloc from using its military power. Hence,
                            during a period of cold war or military conflict short of general war,
                            it is the policy of the United States to affect the conduct of the
                            Sino-Soviet Bloc regimes, especially that of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, in ways that further U.S. security
                            interest and encourage tendencies that lead them to abandon expansionist
                            policies.</p>
                        <p>c. The military position of the United States for a period of cold war or
                            military conflict short of general war will be influenced by the support
                            and cooperation of appropriate major Allies and certain other Free World
                            countries. The United States must convince its Allies that U.S. strategy
                            and policy serve their security as well as that of the United States.
                            Military assistance will be provided by the United States as necessary
                            to insure the availability of strategic bases and key military
                            facilities and to enable other nations of the Free World to develop
                            forces capable of maintaining internal security, of conducting defensive
                            action against military aggression, and where practicable, of
                            contributing to the collective military power of the Free World. In
                            general this military assistance should be consonant with the economic
                            capability of each nation, except where political or military
                            considerations overrule and should include, wherever appropriate, new
                            weapons and advanced technology.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_424" n="424" facs="0448"/>
                        <p>d. The United States with its Allies must defeat the shifting tactic of
                            the Sino-Soviet Bloc, and improve the relative strategic position of the
                            Free World. This will require military forces capable of :</p>
                        <p>(1) Providing a position of strength from which to influence
                            international negotiations for peaceful settlement of basic
                            differences.</p>
                        <p>(2) Reinforcing and exploiting U.S. political, economic, psychological
                            and other actions in the Free World and elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>(3) Demonstrating U.S. intent and readiness to discharge its mutual
                            security and treaty obligations.</p>
                        <p>(4) Deterring aggression.</p>
                        <p>(5) Maintaining the security of the United States, and readiness for
                            initial tasks in a general war.</p>
                        <p>(6) Dealing swiftly and decisively with military aggression short of
                            general war on a scale best calculated to achieve U.S. objectives and
                            avoid the hostilities broadening into general war.</p>
                        <p>e. The United States military posture must provide:</p>
                        <p>(1) A forward deployment of U.S. ready military forces prepared to
                            conduct operations immediately, from positions strategically selected
                            both to counter local aggression and to carry out the initial tasks in a
                            general war.</p>
                        <p>(2) Mobile ready forces, principally based upon U.S. territory, which can
                            be deployed rapidly to provide reinforcement to forward deployed forces
                            and indigenous forces in defeating aggression, or to fight unassisted in
                            the event forward deployed forces are not available and effective
                            indigenous forces are lacking.</p>
                        <p>(3) An atomic retaliatory capability, adequately safeguarded and ready
                            for immediate and effective action.</p>
                        <p>(4) A defense system, including the use of atomic weapons, which will
                            provide an acceptable destruction probability against attacks which the
                            Soviets are capable of launching against the North American continent,
                            in order to protect the war-making capacity and resources of the Western
                            Hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>(5) Forces as necessary to provide the capability of maintaining
                            essential land areas and sea and air communications.</p>
                        <p>f. [<hi rend="italic">remainder of paragraph (20 words) not

                        <p>g. Although military operations short of general war are not intended to
                            provoke general war, military or political conditions might be created
                            which would precipitate the initiation of general war by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Further, the United States, under
                            expanding military operations, might achieve a significant degree of
                            mobilization. Therefore, the deliberate initiation of general war by the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> under these conditions is
                            considered to be unlikely. It would obviously be more advantageous to
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to initiate general war by a
                            surprise atomic attack on the United States.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then invited the

                            to be devoted to the discussion of basic national security policy, as
                            set forth in the reference memorandum of February 19, 1957. After noting
                            the various issues which would be discussed by the Council between today
                            and the middle of May, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>
                            touched on the matter of a discussion paper “on national security costs
                            in relation to total national resources”. He indicated that there had
                            been some questioning of the wisdom of discussing this issue at the
                            first Council meeting on the subject of basic national security policy,
                            rather than at the end. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>
                            said that the reason for getting this issue discussed early in the
                            Council’s deliberation was that it provided an opportunity to thrash out
                            the problem early in the game and obtain the views of the Council on
                            this important matter, which the Council and the Planning Board could
                            keep in mind as they dealt with subsequent issues.</p>

                            discussion of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> invited the National Security
                            Council to consider the introductory paragraph to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707, entitled “Basic Problems for U.S.
                            Security Arising Out of Changes in the World Situation”. Having read
                            this paragraph, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>
                            commented that it was intended to stress the factors of change and
                            extreme fluidity in the existing world situation. He also pointed out
                            that this absence of stability enhanced the danger of war through
                            miscalculation. He invited the comments of the members of the Council
                            but there were none.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> thereafter asked the
                            Council to consider the first of the seven major problems identified by
                            the Planning Board in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707, namely,
                            the problem entitled “Increasing Nuclear Capabilities”, reading as

                            increasingly depend on public conviction that the United States has an

                                    U.S. military power, which is increasingly being organized
                                    around the use of nuclear capabilities, is probably canceled out
                                    by powerful Soviet offensive nuclear capabilities and defense
                                    capabilities; (2) that U.S. nuclear capabilities are probably
                                    not usable to counter Soviet actions in various parts of the
                                    world which threaten U.S. interests; (3) that U.S. non-military
                                    defenses cannot secure U.S. survival as an effective community

                            the United States would counter Soviet actions jeopardizing U.S.
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>“b. <hi rend="italic">U.S. Alliances</hi>. Our allies will increasingly
                            (1) weigh the added security of U.S. alliances against what they may
                            regard as the increasing risk of association with the U.S., (2) be
                            susceptible to Soviet nuclear threats, (3) seek nuclear weapons in order
                            to pursue their own interests.</p>
                        <p>“c. <hi rend="italic">Local War</hi>. The Soviet bloc may be increasingly
                            encouraged to initiate actions short of general war if it believes the
                            United States lacks the capability or the will to react effectively on a
                            local scale and would not react by resort to general war. Such actions
                            would most likely take the form of indirect aggression, i.e., exploiting
                            local conflicts or civil war. Deterrence or defeat of such actions will
                            increasingly depend upon the United States maintaining forces to cope
                            speedily with local Communist or Communist-inspired aggression in a
                            manner calculated to localize the conflict.<note n="7" xml:id="d110fn7">Some members believe the following subparagraph should be included

                        <p>After pointing out the two footnotes on page 2,<note n="8" xml:id="d110fn8">
                                <ref target="#d110fn6">Footnotes 6</ref> and <ref target="#d110fn7">7</ref> above.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> said that this problem could perhaps be
                            summarized by the statement that on the one hand the increasing nuclear
                            capabilities of the United States and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> tended to create a greater deterrent to general war.
                            On the other hand, these increasing capabilities enhanced the risk of
                            local conflict and of general war through miscalculation. He asked for
                            specific comments and, in particular, asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> whether in his opinion the
                            Planning Board had been correct in its statement of the problem and of
                            the consequences for U.S. security.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that
                            certainly increasing nuclear capabilities constituted one of the great
                            problems which we faced. But he said that he could certainly not agree
                            entirely with the Planning Board’s analysis of this problem or, indeed,
                            with the other six problems set forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707. In point of fact, the Planning Board was not
                            asking questions of the National Security Council; it was simply making
                            statements with respect to these problems.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> said that of course what
                            the Planning Board was looking for was guidance, and it made little
                            difference whether they sought the guidance in the form of statements or
                            in the form of questions.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_428" n="428" facs="0452"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> repeated that he
                            did not dissent from the proposition that increasing nuclear
                            capabilities was a major topic for discussion by the National Security
                            Council. But it seemed to him that the Planning Board’s statement of the
                            problem and the consequences of increasing nuclear capabilities and,
                            indeed, the whole of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707, took an
                            unduly pessimistic view of the situation faced by the United States. At
                            an earlier period, the Council had feared that increasing Soviet nuclear
                            capabilities would lead more and more to the development of neutralism.
                            Despite the fact that the Soviet Union has actually threatened two of
                            our allies with the possibility of nuclear attack, the trend toward
                            neutralism in Western Europe has actually lessened and the ties between
                            ourselves and our Western European allies have actually been
                            strengthened. There is indeed a greater desire among Western European
                            nations than ever before to develop a capacity to react against Soviet
                            attack and to work closely with the United States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> commented that if the
                            Planning Board had stated the effect of increasing nuclear capabilities
                            on U.S. alliances in the form of a question, the Secretary would have
                            given a resounding “no” to the idea that the alliances were being
                            weakened by the development of these nuclear capabilities.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed agreement with the views of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, and indeed said he felt that
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ case was
                            obvious. For example, the British would not be talking of taking their
                            troops out of Western Europe if they thought it at all likely that we
                            would also take our U.S. forces out of Western Europe.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> commented that
                            our real trouble stemmed from the fact that our Western European allies
                            are relying too much on the United States and not enough on themselves.
                            The real question is how much the United States can afford. There is
                            danger that our allies will end by placing all their reliance on the
                            United States. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>
                            observed that there was an element of truth in this, but that the allied
                            attitude was rather natural, in view of the fact that the United States
                            had a monopoly on nuclear weapons in the Free World. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> repeated with emphasis his
                            view that our allies were practically placing their whole life and
                            survival in the hands of the United States, in terms, first, of its
                            massive retaliatory capability, and secondarily, on the maintenance of
                            U.S. armed forces in Western Europe. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> expressed the belief that
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>’s appraisal of
                            allied thought on this matter was perhaps a little extreme, but that the
                            thinking of our allies was certainly moving in the direction indicated
                            by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then asked for an
                            expression of opinion from the Council as to the element of mutual
                            deterrence which seemed to be developing as a result of the increasing
                            nuclear capabilities of the United States and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Did the Council agree with the
                            position <pb xml:id="pg_429" n="429" facs="0453"/>taken by the Planning
                            Board with particular respect to the point, in subparagraph c, that the
                            Soviet bloc might be increasingly encouraged to initiate action short of
                            general war if it believes the United States lacks the capability or
                            will to react effectively on a local scale or would not react by resort
                            to general war?</p>
                        <p>In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>’s request
                            for guidance, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            said he took particular exception to the statement that deterrence or
                            defeat of Soviet aggression on a local scale would depend upon the
                            United States maintaining forces which could cope speedily with local
                            Communist aggression. Why, he asked, should the United States alone be
                            saddled with the responsibility for reacting speedily to such Soviet
                            local aggression? It has been our theory in the past that such a
                            reaction should largely be the responsibility of the countries which
                            were attacked. We would do the “big stuff” (large-scale retaliatory
                            attack). Our allies were expected to handle local hostilities.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that with respect to subparagraph c on local war,
                            he believed that the Planning Board had entered into a field which was
                            highly speculative in character, and one in which it was hard to reach
                            clear and firm conclusions. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> repeated his view that the sentence on the
                            necessity of U.S. forces as a deterrent to local acts of aggression by
                            the Soviet Union ran contrary to the entire basic strategy of the United
                            States. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> agreed
                            with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> that this
                            idea was certainly contrary to what the United States desired, but that
                            it nevertheless seemed to be the way things were heading. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> continued, saying that
                            the deterrence of local aggression should depend, for example on the
                            development of a worthwhile and effective German Army in Western Europe
                            and similar effective forces being developed by our allies elsewhere in
                            the Free World, such as in Turkey and in Korea. Therefore, he believed
                            this statement on deterrence to be essentially false.</p>
                        <p>The President asked the Council to think back to the situation we
                            confronted four years ago. At that time the Administration was of the
                            opinion that the one thing we could do which would be most helpful to
                            the Soviet Union would be to scatter our U.S. military forces in any and
                            all areas overseas where we felt it possible that the Soviet Union might
                            some day attack. Indeed, the sending of six divisions of American forces
                            to Western Europe began initially under the guise of an emergency
                            measure. Now it has become permanent. Nevertheless, our policy should be
                            that our friends and allies supply the means for local defense on the
                            ground and that the United States should come into the act with air and
                            naval forces alone.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then invited the
                            Council’s attention to the second footnote on page 2 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707, as being closely related to the
                            issue the Council was discussing. Certain members of the Planning Board
                            had expressed fear that the United States would refrain from becoming
                                <pb xml:id="pg_430" n="430" facs="0454"/>involved in military action
                            to assist a small Free World country lest the result of the involvement
                            end up with the United States becoming involved in general nuclear
                            war.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> inquired
                            whether the best answer to the question posed by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> was not likely to be obtained by
                            picking out a few actual situations around the world and inquiring what
                            the United States would do if Communist-inspired aggression broke out in
                            any of these areas. He added that he personally did not agree with the
                            Planning Board’s statement on deterrence of local war depending on the
                            maintenance of U.S. forces to cope speedily with such local Communist
                            aggression. On three separate occasions since this Administration had
                            been in power, the National Security Council had faced the prospect and
                            possibility of local wars caused by Communist aggression. In each case,
                            when the chips were finally down, the military people came in and said
                            that we could not undertake to fight such a war without the use of
                            nuclear weapons. This had occurred in the case of a possible resumption
                            of hostilities in Korea; it had occurred in Indochina; and it had
                            occurred in the matter of Taiwan and the offshore islands. It therefore
                            seemed to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> that
                            these actions of the Council demonstrated that we have crossed a bridge
                            in the matter of the use of nuclear weapons, and that a lot of the
                            Planning Board’s statement was purely theoretical. In practice, we must
                            face up to the facts and decide what we propose to do.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> commented that
                            one notable fallacy in the approach to this problem in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707 was the assumption that any war in
                            which nuclear weapons were used would necessarily develop into a general
                            nuclear war and the United States using nuclear weapons against Moscow.
                            The President, however, had not said this to Mr. Churchill on the
                            occasion of the crisis in Taiwan or the crisis in Indochina. On these
                            two occasions the United States had no intention of attacking Moscow.
                            Accordingly, it is not true that we would be obliged to choose between
                            doing nothing in the event of local Soviet aggression or else of
                            engaging in general nuclear war.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> stated that the Planning
                            Board had not acted under any such assumption. <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707 merely pointed out that if we were now faced with
                            we same kind of crisis which we faced earlier with respect to the
                            Chinese offshore islands, there would now be a more serious risk of
                            involving the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in any hostilities
                            which might eventuate.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> agreed with Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>, and went on to say
                            that we should ask the military what this country would do at the
                            present time if we were to face another situation such as that in the
                            offshore islands. Would we use ground troops to defend these islands
                            against Communist aggression? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> commented that it rather seemed that when the
                            Planning Board became very specific in its recommended courses of
                            action, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>
                            complained and <pb xml:id="pg_431" n="431" facs="0455"/>asked for more
                            general statements. On the other hand, when the Planning Board was
                            general, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>
                            always called on it to be more specific.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> observed that the
                            situation today was very different than it was when the United States
                            was involved in the crisis over Quemoy and the offshore islands. The
                            Soviet capability of damaging Western Europe was far greater than it had
                            been on the earlier occasion.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that he
                            admitted that we ran the risk of becoming involved in general nuclear
                            war if we used nuclear weapons to fight local wars. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> reminded the Council of the
                            possible actions which it had discussed with respect to U.S. courses of
                            action in the event that the Soviets used military force to reimpose
                            their control over Poland. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> thought the situation in Poland and that in the
                            Chinese offshore islands altogether different. Poland lay on the borders
                            of the Soviet Union and was regarded by the Soviet Union as vital to its
                            security.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> asked the Council
                            members to read the first footnote on page 2 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707. He insisted that the assumption underlying the
                            views expressed in this footnote was that the United States would not
                            dare to use nuclear weapons in a local war because of fear that such a
                            course of action would involve general war. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> stated that he did not believe
                            this assumption to be correct.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that if the Soviets were calculating on the
                            wisdom of going to war with the United States, they would not be swayed
                            by any fear that the United States would bomb airfields in Communist
                            China. Their calculations would be based on quite other
                            considerations.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName> stated that as he
                            had read over these paragraphs and footnotes on the first problem of
                            increasing nuclear capabilities, he had been of the opinion that the
                            Planning Board was trying to direct the Council’s attention to the
                            attitude of the public rather than to the policies of the U.S.
                            Government. It was plain enough that there was a lot of talk in the
                            newspapers about the nuclear capabilities of the United States and the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> canceling each other out. He
                            therefore hoped that the Council could indicate to the Planning Board
                            that our policy should be to try to prevent such public attitudes from
                            crystalizing, or to correct these attitudes before they crystalized.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName> suggested that
                            there should be an addition at the end of the first sentence of
                            subparagraph a on page 2. The addition should read, “and an effective
                            non-military defense.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> expressed the
                            view that the likelihood of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            letting itself become directly involved in general war was rather
                            remote. They would go in for subversion instead.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_432" n="432" facs="0456"/>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> inquired whether
                            the Council had not been of the general opinion in the past that if the
                            United States began to use nuclear weapons in a local war, there would
                            be a tendency for such a local war to develop into a general war. The
                            President replied to Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> by stating that earlier this morning he had been
                            shown a diagram. This diagram indicated that a 2 <gloss target="#t_KT1">KT</gloss> tactical nuclear weapon would create only one-twentieth
                            of the damage wrought on Tokyo by the fire bomb raids of 1945. It
                            therefore seemed “silly” to the President to think that resort by the
                            United States to the use of these small tactical nuclear weapons would
                            necessarily start a general nuclear war. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> speculated that the President’s illustration
                            referred to too small a tactical weapon. Admiral Strauss doubtless had
                            larger and more powerful ones in mind. The atomic bomb used against
                            Nagasaki was of 20 <gloss target="#t_KT1">KT</gloss>. The President
                            nevertheless repeated his view that there was no reason to think we
                            would inevitably involve ourselves in general war if we made use of
                            these tactical nuclear weapons in a local situation. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> commented that one thing was
                            certain: We would have a general nuclear war if the armed forces of the
                            United States and the Soviet Union ever got into direct actual
                            combat.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> returned to his
                            point that if the United States ever started on military action in order
                            to secure a vital U.S. objective and in so doing made use of nuclear
                            weapons, it was very likely that in turn nuclear weapons would be used
                            against the United States. Certainly there was a likelihood of general
                            war in that kind of a situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> expressed the opinion
                            that the Planning Board had been given guidance on the first problem in
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707—that is, increasing nuclear
                            capabilities. He therefore suggested that the Council turn to the second
                            important problem identified by the Planning Board, namely, the decline
                            in Western Europe’s position. He read the problem and the statement of
                            the consequences, as follows:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">“The Problem:</p>
                        <p>“The continuing decline in the power position of Western Europe relative
                            to the United States and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has
                            been emphasized by recent developments, including the Franco-British
                            failure over Suez.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">“Consequences for U.S. security include:</p>
                        <p>“a. <hi rend="italic">Changing World Role</hi>. In the light of their

                            Atlantic Alliance as well as their commitments elsewhere. Certain areas
                            from which they retract will require strong U.S. support to maintain an
                            independent existence.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_433" n="433" facs="0457"/>

                            develop. The internal condition of Western Europe remains sound. If,
                            additionally, the area moves toward closer political, economic, and even
                            military association, a trend toward a declining self-confidence may be
                            partly checked and over time reversed, enabling Western Europe to
                            continue as the strongest Free World area outside the United States. The
                            United States can encourage and assist these moves.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then solicited the views
                            of the members of the Council. Was this not a major problem? Was not the
                            decline of Western Europe’s position more apparent now than it had been
                            before the Franco-British failure in Suez? He directed his questions
                            particularly to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he would
                            commence by striking out the title at the head of the problem—that is,
                            “Decline in Western Europe’s Position”. Far from being in decline, there
                            was now for the first time a real prospect that the position of Western
                            Europe was definitely improving. This was the result of the growing
                            measures toward European integration and delineation of a new
                            relationship between Europe and Africa. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> believed that the Planning
                            Board’s treatment of this problem was again too pessimistic. From a
                            strictly military point of view, he admitted that the position of
                            Western Europe had been declining ever since World War I. This had been
                            most recently demonstrated in Suez. If one simply stopped with this
                            military decline, one could well be pessimistic, but if the move toward
                            European unification goes forward as it appears likely to do, and if a
                            sounder relationship can be developed by Europe with Africa, the
                            position of Western Europe is really much more hopeful than it has been
                            in a very long time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> said that the Planning
                            Board had tried to take account of the favorable factors in subparagraph
                            b on page 4. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            said that if this were the case, he felt that there was a lack of
                            balance in the Planning Board’s analysis of the position of Western
                            Europe. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> pointed
                            out that in the past Europe had never faced a vast and powerfully armed
                            Russia. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said
                            that he personally was more optimistic today than ever before about the
                            prospects of Western Europe. The President commented that both

                            French and our other Western European allies could be expected to look
                            increasingly to the United States for military support. As these Western
                            European allies reduced their strength, was the United States expected
                            to take up the slack?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> recommended
                            that we back off and let these Western European states develop a greater
                            degree of self-reliance. Much of the self-reliance that they have
                            already developed derives from our policy and action in the Suez crisis.
                            He again repeated that he was optimistic, but said that we must insist
                            that our allies in Western Europe develop self-reliance.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> observed that matters
                            were in reverse. Our young men (the Planning Board) seemed gloomy. Our
                            older men (the Council) seemed optimistic. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> turned to Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> and said, optimistic
                            or otherwise, the Secretary of the Treasury was going to have to lend
                            the British and the French a lot more money, because they were both
                            about to go bankrupt.</p>
                        <p>The President said that after all, the British were not saying that they
                            were going to reduce their own defensive forces; they are merely getting
                            weary of what we ourselves are doing in Western Europe— that is,
                            maintaining large forces on the continent.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> expressed the
                            opinion that, earlier, the National Security Council had been too gloomy
                            in its prognostications of what was going to happen to Western Europe.
                            At the moment, however, he feared that the Council was too optimistic.
                            After all, the common market is not yet realized. While he too was
                            basically optimistic on Western Europe’s prospects over the long haul,
                            there were many hard problems facing Western Europe in the immediate
                            future. The President said this all might be so, but the United States
                            cannot take the whole world on its shoulders and nurse these nations.
                            They must learn to help themselves.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> predicted that
                            the less we did for Western Europe, the faster they would move in the
                            direction of greater strength and unity. This had been proved only
                            recently in the matter of the <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss>. The
                            European Defense Community had failed largely because of the
                            stand-offish attitude of Britain. This attitude had now completely
                            changed. The British now want a free trade area in Europe, of which the
                            British would be a part. We must, of course, watch our step so as not
                            ourselves to get sucked into such an area. The President said he would
                            rather lend what was needed to a united Western Europe than anything we
                            had done up to now to assist our Western European allies
                            individually.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_435" n="435" facs="0459"/>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> again warned of
                            undue optimism on the speed of the integration of Western Europe. The
                            President, however, said that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MG1">Mollet</persName> had informed him that the European common market
                            would be a fact by next September, and that Ollenhauer had been equally
                            optimistic. If this proved wrong and the integration didn’t happen, the
                            President predicted that the Western European nations would perish in
                            spite of anything the United States could do to help them. Governor
                                <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> agreed that the
                            integration would occur, but that it would take five years to become a
                            fact. The President replied that there had been a greater awareness and
                            realization among the Western European powers of their own situation in
                            recent months. This was a most desirable development.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that
                            when he had spoken privately with <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> in Paris last December about the Suez
                                situation,<note n="11" xml:id="d110fn11">Not further identified.
                                Regarding conversations between Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LSS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> and
                                    <persName>Dulles</persName> at the North Atlantic Council
                                Ministerial meetings in Paris, December 11–14, 1956, see vol. XVI,
                                pp. 1278 ff.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> had said that Britain’s
                            worst miscalculation was its miscalculation about the power of the
                            United Nations. From this, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, one could deduce that Anglo-French moral
                            weakness was really more significant than Anglo-French military
                            weakness. The Anglo-French debacle at Suez did not so much expose
                            military as moral weakness.</p>
                        <p>The President stated parenthetically that he was absolutely convinced
                            that the Israelis had jumped the gun on the British and French.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then invited the
                            Council’s attention to the third major problem identified by the
                            Planning Board in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707. He read the
                            statement of the problem and the consequences as follows:</p>
                        <p>“DECLINE IN THE SOVIET POSITION IN EASTERN EUROPE</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">“The Problem:</p>
                        <p>“While the economic and military strength of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> itself continues to grow, the Soviet power position in
                            Eastern Europe, including the reliability of the satellite armed forces,
                            has been weakened and its ideological claims have been damaged by Soviet
                            repression in Hungary.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">“Consequences for U.S. security include:</p>
                        <p>“a. <hi rend="italic">Soviet Position</hi>. Eastern European ferment
                            increases both opportunities for Free World encouragement of
                            evolutionary change and dangers from Soviet hypersensitivity to Western
                            actions which the Kremlin considers threatening to its security
                            interests in this area.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_436" n="436" facs="0460"/>
                        <p>“b. <hi rend="italic">Satellite Change</hi>. U.S. political and economic
                            policy can strengthen forces and trends favoring orderly and gradual
                            satellite developments toward independence. Limited economic assistance
                            and cultural exchanges, on a selective basis, will have increasing
                            importance, as will our broad political posture.</p>
                        <p>“c. <hi rend="italic">Prospects of Violence</hi>. So long as the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> attempts to dominate Eastern Europe,
                            there will be a danger of further outbreaks of violence. Any significant
                            resort to force inside the area could spread beyond control and
                            eventually involve the United States, even if it decided at the time to
                            refrain from military intervention. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is unlikely to withdraw, in whole or in part, from the
                            area without what it would consider a commensurate retraction of Western
                            power.”</p>
                        <p>The President expressed the opinion that while the word “including” in
                            the third line of the statement of the problem was probably correct, he
                            felt that the term “particularly” would be an improvement.</p>
                        <p>Because time was running out, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> asked the Council to turn to the fourth problem,
                            namely, the rising position of Communist China. He again read the
                            statement of the problem and the consequence for U.S. security, as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">“The Problem:</p>
                        <p>“Communist China continues its economic and military growth. It is
                            increasingly treated as a great power in the international community,
                            passing its potential local rivals for leadership in the Far East and
                            exerting greater influence in the Communist bloc.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">“Consequences for U.S. security include:</p>
                        <p>“a. <hi rend="italic">Implications for Free Asia</hi>. Non-Communist
                            Asians are increasingly sensitive to Peiping’s preponderant military
                            power and rapid economic growth. Neither of its potential rivals, India
                            or Japan, exerts a successful counter-influence in the area. Elsewhere,
                            most of the other Free Asian states, including India, have been unable
                            to match its rapid economic development.</p>
                        <p>“b. <hi rend="italic">Acceptance</hi>. Present trends will require
                            increasing effort and resources in order for the United States to
                            prevent Communist China from being admitted to the UN and recognized by
                            additional Governments, and could ultimately jeopardize the continuation
                            of an independent Taiwan unless protected by an acceptable general
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p>“c. <hi rend="italic">Sino-Soviet Relations</hi>. The increasing role of
                            Communist China in the affairs of the bloc could create opportunities
                            for the United States to exert divisive pressures on Sino-Soviet
                            relations.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out that the
                            statement of the problem and the consequences did not represent the view
                            of any department of the Executive Branch, but only of himself and the
                            members of the Planning Board. He thereafter inquired whether there were
                            any views <pb xml:id="pg_437" n="437" facs="0461"/>as to the increasing
                            strength of Communist China and the difficulties that this increasing
                            strength would pose in the future for the United States.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that he
                            disagreed more strongly with this portion of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707 than with any other part of the report. It seemed
                            to him that the statement on the rising position of Communist China
                            fully accepted the view that Communist China represented the wave of the
                            future for Asia and that we must accommodate ourselves to this alleged
                            fact. Such views as to the wave of the future prevailed not so very long
                            ago with respect to the Soviet Union in Europe, but certain things had
                            happened, and happened quite recently, to make the situation appear
                            quite otherwise. These same people now feel that the wave of the future
                            is with the Free World countries and not the Communist powers.
                            Everywhere in the world the local Communist Parties have weakened, their
                            discipline gone and their loyalty to Moscow seriously impaired. Indeed,
                            Communist weakness generally had been so exposed that the Communist
                            regimes could no longer even be sure of the loyalty of their own younger
                            generations, who had been brought up with knowledge of nothing but
                            Communist regimes. Thus Communism is not the wave of the future, but is
                            rather a receding wave.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> further predicted
                            that developments would in the future come in Communist China which
                            would just as effectively prove that Communism was not the wave of the
                            future in Europe. Therefore, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> thought that there was no point whatsoever in the
                            argument that we must make some kind of a bargain with Communist China
                            in order to save Taiwan—for example, admitting Communist China into the
                            United Nations. In the future—perhaps in one year, two years, five
                            years—Communist China will be on the defensive. There is no need for the
                            United States or the Free World, therefore, to accommodate to the
                            Communist Chinese and give them what they want—the view which seems to
                            be implicit in this section of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707.
                            Indeed, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707 might be described as a
                            rather dangerous paper. The Secretary said he had been informed that the
                            Filipino Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs had informed his Government
                            that the “policy planning board” had now come to believe that the United
                            States would be obliged to recognize Communist China. The Filipino
                            official was, of course, disturbed and dismayed at this report.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out that nowhere
                            did <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707 say anything about
                            recognizing Communist China. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> answered that the paper certainly implied such
                            recognition by the United States. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> said that obviously, then, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> did not agree with position
                            taken by the Planning Board in this section of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_438" n="438" facs="0462"/>
                        <p>The President immediately returned to the presumed leak of information
                            about the contents of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707. He
                            pointed out that if this report had been carefully held in the Planning
                            Board, and none of the members of the Council had seen it until today or
                            very recently, how did this Filipino official see the paper? He said
                            that it made him feel almost as though he ought to abolish all meetings,
                            all conferences, and all reports.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> commented that if the
                            Planning Board was stopped from discussing all alternatives to existing
                            policy, he was unable to see how it could continue to perform its
                            business. The President replied that he did not quarrel in the least
                            with the alternatives and policies discussed in the Planning Board. The
                            real problem was how the contents of this paper had leaked. These leaks
                            were altogether frightening. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then stated that he knew our policy on Communist
                            China was a sacred cow, and that he himself was personally responsible
                            for raising this issue in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707. To
                            this, the President replied that he had no objections to raising the
                            issue, but he wanted these issues kept strictly within the limits of the
                            Planning Board and the Council. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then expressed doubt whether this paper itself
                            had leaked out. The fact of the matter was that the Filipino official
                            had got hold of an idea which was set forth in the paper.</p>
                        <p>The President went on to say that the Planning Board had the right to
                            discuss anything that it felt it should discuss in an <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> paper, including the desirability of
                            the assassination of the President; but whatever it discussed, the
                            contents of the discussion must be kept secret. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> stated his view that leaks in
                            this Government came from people whose ox was being gored, and he very
                            much doubted that any disclosure could be traced to a member of the
                            Planning Board. But in any event, he gathered from the discussion of
                            this item that the Planning Board statement on the problem of the rising
                            position of Communist China was not acceptable to the Council. He added,
                            turning in the direction of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen
                                Dulles</persName>, that the views expressed by the Council on this
                            matter seemed very different from those which were found in the National
                            Intelligence Estimate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> pointed out that
                            the State Department intelligence people had concurred in the reference
                            National Intelligence Estimate, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> proceeded to read the statements in the <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> concerning Communist China and
                            Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that the
                            course of action which would most certainly undermine the Chinese
                            Nationalist Government on Taiwan and lose the island to the Communists,
                            would be a general settlement between the United States and Communist
                            China. The President said that he agreed with this statement of
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then directed the
                            Council to the statement of the fifth problem, on the rise of
                            nationalism, which read as follows:</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_439" n="439" facs="0463"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">“The Problem:</p>
                        <p>“The sharply accelerated growth of nationalism and anti-colonialism in
                            Asia and Africa increases both aspirations for a better life and the
                            risk of local conflicts between these newly emerging states.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">“Consequences for U.S. security include:</p>
                        <p>“a. <hi rend="italic">Local Conflict</hi> While generally wishing to
                            follow a policy of non-alignment, these countries will seek political
                            support and military aid from the United States or the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in their disputes with each other. In
                            the Middle East, particularly, this process could become cumulative—even
                            to the point of hostilities involving the United States and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>“b. <hi rend="italic">Economic Development</hi> If aspirations for
                            economic development are frustrated, the likelihood will be increased
                            that extremist elements will come into power. Capabilities in Asia and
                            Africa for economic development vary widely; in some countries the
                            principal problem is lack of administrative and technical skills; in
                            others, additional resources are the major need.</p>
                        <p>“c. <hi rend="italic">Base Arrangements</hi>. In the Asian-African area,
                            as well as throughout the rest of the world, the retention of U.S. bases
                            has been complicated by the rise of nationalism and lessened concern
                            over Soviet aggression, and by pressures for additional economic aid and
                            military assistance.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> expressed the view that
                            there was not much need to discuss this problem at length, but that he
                            would very much desire the views of the Secretary of State on the sixth
                            problem, namely, the increasing role of the United Nations. He read the
                            statement of the problem and the consequences for U.S. security, as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">“The Problem:</p>
                        <p>“The UN General Assembly’s involvement in world problems is increasing.
                            The UN’s considerable prestige makes it a useful instrument not only for
                            preventing or localizing small-power conflicts but also for gaining
                            world support for U.S. policies. However, its membership today includes
                            many countries which do not have the direct interest or ability to act
                            in a responsible way.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">“Consequences for U.S. security include:</p>
                        <p>“a. <hi rend="italic">Voting Procedures</hi>. The growing influence in
                            the UN of nationalist-neutralist forces, as well as the unwillingness of
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to abide by certain UN
                            decisions, may lead at times to UN action or inaction contrary to U.S.
                            interests. This may require a re-examination of U.S. attitudes toward
                            the UN.</p>
                        <p>“b. <hi rend="italic">Decreased U.S. Reliance</hi>. Decreased support of
                            the UN by the United States would, however, undermine the UN’s prestige
                            and its usefulness as a means of settling or limiting international
                            disputes and indirectly damage U.S. prestige.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then added some
                            explanatory remarks about the discussion of the problem in the Planning
                            Board.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_440" n="440" facs="0464"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that, of
                            course, there was a certain risk involved in the increased use of the
                            United Nations, but it was not a very great risk. He recalled that at
                            the very beginning of the UN, at the San Francisco meeting, he had
                            forecast a time when the UN could be conceivably dominated by influence
                            hostile to the United States. This prediction had been made in
                            connection with discussions of the right of withdrawal from the UN.
                            Nevertheless, he went on, U.S. influence in the UN is today greater than
                            it has ever been before, despite the recent admission of a number of
                            Soviet bloc countries. Even in Western Europe the attitude toward the
                            United Nations is improving again. The recent debates on Algeria and
                            Cyprus resulted in unanimous resolutions which pleased everybody.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he still
                            believed that the UN is so constituted that if we have a sound
                            defensible position, that position will not be overridden by the
                            pro-Soviet bloc. On the whole, UN developments were encouraging if they
                            were properly used. Of course, the voting procedure is bad and we should
                            probably have some system of weighted voting, as he had once
                            recommended. There should also have been a Charter review, but we were
                            unable to get a review of the UN Charter because this objective was
                            blocked by the very countries who are now squawking loudest about the
                            voting procedures in the United Nations. An example of this is M.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> and his article on the
                            UN in the January issue of <hi rend="italic">Foreign Affairs</hi>. <note n="12" xml:id="d110fn12">

                                184–190.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> inquired whether
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> would not agree
                            that the voting procedure in the United Nations is, theoretically at
                            least, a risk to the United States. There was always the possibility of
                            a number of little countries banding together.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> said there was only time
                            for a mention of the seventh and final problem, Continuing Budgetary
                            Strains; but since this problem would be developed more fully at the
                            next meeting of the Council on the subject of basic national security
                            policy, it would be enough simply to read through the statement of this
                            problem, which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>
                            proceeded to do, as follows:</p>
                        <p>“Projections of the budget through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1961
                            demonstrate that the United States faces the prospect of continuing
                            budgetary strains, and possibly the return of substantial deficits.
                            Taking the most optimistic assumption of uninterrupted U.S. economic
                            growth at a rate of $16 billion per year, presently approved programs
                            would result in expenditures rising at least as rapidly as revenues
                            through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1960 at present tax rates. On
                            the assumption, which Treasury and Budget consider more realistic for
                            planning purposes, that economic growth over this <pb xml:id="pg_441" n="441" facs="0465"/>period is interrupted at some time by an
                            adjustment at least as large as that in 1954, expenditures for present
                            programs would result in sizable deficits.</p>
                        <p>“Assuming such an adjustment, a tax reduction of $6 billion, less than in
                            1954, would increase the budget gap to nearly $10 billion unless
                            programs are cut. It is quite possible that Congress may in any event
                            impose a tax reduction during this period.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> also briefly described
                            the Annex to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707, which dealt with
                            economic considerations and the budgetary and fiscal outlook for the
                            next few years.</p>
                        <p>With respect to this problem and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>’s comments on it, the President stated that he
                            was terribly interested in finding ways and means by which we can reduce
                            or eliminate some of our programs. We have got to find ways and means of
                            doing this. It was not so much a matter of the present costs of these
                            programs, but the increasing costs of their upkeep. The President also
                            expressed some doubt about the view that a tax cut would surely mean a
                            loss of revenue to the Government. Under certain circumstances, a tax
                            cut could actually result in an increase in the receipts of the
                            Government rather than a decrease.</p>

                        <p rend="center">The Problem</p>
                        <p>To estimate the world reaction to a major US shelter program phased over
                            an eight-year period and costing about $32 billion.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Assumptions</p>
                        <p>1. The US Government would develop a strong information program that
                            would justify a national effort of this magnitude. In particular, it
                            would:</p>
                        <p>a. give intensive and extended publicity to the implications of nuclear
                            warfare for human survival; and</p>
                        <p>b. make clear that there is sufficient risk of nuclear war to warrant the
                            program.</p>
                        <p>2. At the same time, the US Government would make strong efforts to
                            prevent undue misunderstanding or alarm, and particularly to minimize
                            adverse reaction abroad by assurances that the program did not indicate
                            any significant change in US foreign, defense, or aid policies, or any
                            change in the US view of the likelihood of war.</p>
                        <p rend="center">The Estimate</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">General Reactions</hi>. World reaction to the
                            postulated program would depend to a considerable degree upon the world
                            situation existing at the time the program was subjected to
                            Congressional and public consideration and upon the nature of the public
                            debate which took place. The entire subject of nuclear warfare is
                            technically complex and emotionally charged; the debate would be
                            reported throughout the world, and many of the reports and discussions
                            would be over-dramatized and distorted, in some cases deliberately. The
                            US program would be quickly and vigorously exploited by Communist and
                            anti-American propaganda.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_443" n="443" facs="0467"/>
                        <p>2. Reactions would vary considerably throughout the world. Of all
                            countries, Japan is most sensitive to developments respecting nuclear
                            weapons, and would be most alarmed by initiation of the US program and
                            by the publicity which would almost certainly accompany it. The peoples
                            of Western Europe, conscious as they are of involvement in the East-West
                            struggle and aware to a considerable degree of the nuclear threat, would
                            also be greatly concerned. On the other hand, countries such as those in
                            the Southern Hemisphere, far removed from the probable areas of nuclear
                            warfare, would be far less interested. Other nations in which the
                            population is only dimly conscious of the implications of nuclear
                            weapons would also be largely unaffected. The following paragraphs,
                            insofar as they describe reactions in a general way, must therefore be
                            read with these distinctions in mind.</p>
                        <p>3. Reactions would also vary over time. As described below, we believe
                            that the initial impact of the shelter program would be great throughout
                            many areas of the world. With each annual congressional presentation
                            there would be some revival of the matter. Nevertheless once the program
                            was established and its implications understood and digested, it would
                            tend to recede into the background of interest. Moreover, it is to be
                            expected that during the next eight years many disclosures of the nature
                            of nuclear warfare will be made, and many developments will affect
                            popular ideas of the likelihood of general war. Thus some of the
                            reactions described below might occur in any case, though in a different
                            context from that indicated by the proposed program.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Reaction among the Major US Allies</hi>. The initial
                            presentation of a program of this nature and magnitude, however
                            qualified by the Administration, would almost certainly generate a good
                            deal of alarm and confusion among the general public in allied
                            countries. Some influential groups would interpret the program as
                            indicating that the US had lost faith in its alliances, intended to cut
                            its commitments, and was preparing to retire into “Fortress America.”
                            Others, particularly those inclined to anti-Americanism, would allege
                            that the US, despite its protestations of peace, had concluded that a
                            showdown with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was unavoidable.
                            Many would demand that their own governments undertake a corresponding
                            program. There would probably be demands for more progress on
                            disarmament and possibly for immediately outlawing nuclear weapons.
                            Extremists would claim that the US shelter program furnished evidence
                            for the contentions they had long been arguing: that US bases should not
                            be allowed on their national territory, that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was a failure, that governments allied to the US
                            should renounce the alliance and make the best terms possible with the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_444" n="444" facs="0468"/>
                        <p>5. Some of these views would initially be held to greater or less degree
                            in all allied governments, who would ask themselves why the US should
                            allocate to shelters such substantial additional resources, which could
                            have been used for other defense purposes. They would fear that the
                            shelter program might be part of a broader decision for American
                            withdrawal, and that the US had lost some of its confidence that general
                            war could be prevented through the deterrent power of its force in
                            being. They would express these concerns to the US Government. However,
                            if the US gives the assurances described in Assumption 2, we do not
                            believe that they would be stampeded by these anxieties or by initial
                            popular reaction. While elements of doubt would certainly persist and
                            lead them to scrutinize other American actions with unusual care,
                            governments, as well as influential elements of the public, would
                            probably come to recognize that the shelter program, taken by itself,
                            was a defensive measure and did not necessarily indicate any basic
                            change in US foreign policy or substantially affect the likelihood of
                            general war. However, they would be exposed to strong popular demands
                            for shelter programs in their own countries. They would be likely to
                            request US aid for carrying out such programs, and if aid were not
                            forthcoming, they might divert resources from other defense expenditures
                            for use on shelters, with resulting jeopardy to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defense effort and its political
                            unity.</p>
                        <p>6. The program would probably have an effect on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> relationships, particularly if it were initiated at a
                            time when there were unusually difficult and divisive issues before the
                            community. In such circumstances, the announcement of the shelter
                            program would tend to intensify already existing difficulties.</p>
                        <p>7. As time went on, the initial popular reactions would almost certainly
                            diminish, and the more emotional manifestations would tend to disappear.
                            Some people might find reassurance in considering that if the US thought
                            such a shelter program worthwhile, then the possibilities of survival in
                            nuclear war might not be as dark as they had previously supposed. Some
                            might even estimate that the US overall military position had been
                            strengthened. Any initial feeling that the program made the US free to
                            pursue a more risky policy would give way to a realization that even the
                            completion of the program would still leave the US exposed to vast
                            destruction and danger, and would not put it in any position to engage
                            in provocative actions against the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Despite this tendency to see the program in a normal
                            light, it must be recognized that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the Communists generally, as well as other
                            anti-American elements, would continue to make capital of the subject in
                            their propaganda.</p>
                        <p>8. If, despite the assurances given by the US Government, the
                            implementation of the shelter program were accompanied by significant
                            reductions in US foreign economic and security programs or <pb xml:id="pg_445" n="445" facs="0469"/>commitments, allied reaction
                            would be substantially more serious. In these circumstances the program
                            would generally be viewed as fore-shadowing a substantial US withdrawal.
                            Strong impetus would then be given to third-force and neutralist
                            tendencies in Europe, to reconsideration of existing treaty commitments
                            to the US, and to accommodation by some countries with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. As a result of these general
                            tendencies, US base arrangements might be jeopardized, allied defense
                            expenditures reduced, and the US diplomatic position seriously
                            impaired.</p>
                        <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Reaction in Neutral Countries</hi>. Among the
                            neutrals, particularly outside Europe, a US decision to implement a
                            shelter program would almost certainly reinforce the desire to remain
                            neutral. In India, for example, such a decision would provide a strong
                            argument for justifying the role India has been playing. Among the more
                            sophisticated of the underdeveloped countries, and particularly those
                            which have hoped for US aid in development, there would be fear that a
                            shelter program of the projected magnitude would in effect preclude the
                            kind and scale of US economic aid for which they had hoped. In the
                            larger number of countries which are uncommitted and outside the main
                            stream of international politics, there would almost certainly be a
                            reinforced desire to remain uncommitted; they would feel that it had
                            become even more desirable to keep out of the quarrels of the great
                            powers.</p>
                        <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Soviet Reaction</hi>. The Soviet leaders would
                            vigorously exploit a US shelter program in their continuing propaganda
                            theme that the US was preparing for a new war, and they would utilize it
                            in connection with other themes directed towards US allies as well as in
                            neutral states.</p>
                        <p>11. Initiation of a US shelter program would not in itself lead the
                            Soviet leaders to conclude that the US now believed war to be
                            inevitable, nor would it be a critical factor in their estimate of US
                            intentions. They might believe that a completed US shelter program would
                            somewhat reduce the deterrents upon US action which are now exerted by
                            Soviet capabilities. Thus, the inauguration of a shelter program would
                            help to keep alive their anxieties over US intentions, and they might
                            become particularly concerned if other US military expenditures or
                            military preparations were to have a simultaneous and rapid increase.
                            Even in this case, they would not rely solely upon these moves as
                            indicators of US intentions, but would weigh all the factors in the US
                            military and political posture and in its world position.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> commenced his briefing,
                            pausing to explain the difference of view which had arisen in the
                            Planning Board with regard to the statement of the basic threat to U.S.
                            security in paragraph 1 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/1,
                            reading as follows:</p>
                        <p>“1. The basic threat to U.S. security is presented by the <hi rend="italic">combination</hi> of:</p>
                        <p>“a. The continuing hostility of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            and Communist China and their growing military and economic power;</p>
                        <p>“b. The unrestricted development of nuclear weapons systems; and</p>
                        <p>“c. Weakness or instability in critical areas where there is strong
                            pressure for economic or political change.</p>
                        <p>“Some members believe that the basic threat is expressed in paragraph
                            1–a; that the development of nuclear weapons systems would not
                            constitute a basic threat were it not for the continuing hostility of
                            the Sino-Soviet bloc; and that the weakness or instability in critical
                            areas, while posing serious problems to the United States, does not
                            constitute a basic threat to U.S. security.”</p>
                        <p>The President said that personally he found himself in a position
                            half-way between the two sides. Certainly, he said, the fundamental
                            threat to the United States was constituted by the continuing hostility
                            of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Communist China.
                            However, this fundamental threat was intensified by the considerations
                            in subparagraphs b and c. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> expressed his agreement with the President’s
                            position. He added that hostility to the United States from a militarily
                            impotent nation was a matter of no anxiety. Moreover, if a friendly
                            country developed nuclear capabilities, that wouldn’t worry him very
                            much <pb xml:id="pg_447" n="447" facs="0471"/>either. The President
                            ended the discussion by complaining that there was danger that we would
                            be picking nits with boxing gloves; let the text stand as written.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> continued his briefing
                            (copy of briefing note filed in the minutes of the meeting),<note n="3" xml:id="d112fn3">The briefing note was not filed in the
                                minutes.</note> and apologized for <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/1 as not being in form or content likely to be
                            very provocative and as calling essentially for a continuation of
                            existing national strategy. He then asked the Secretary of State if he
                            had any views on <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/1.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he thought
                            the paper was excellent, and that a great deal of information had been
                            compressed into a small space. However, said the Secretary, he was not
                            quite clear on the meaning of paragraph 8.</p>
                        <p>This paragraph reads as follows:</p>
                        <p>“<hi rend="italic">8. Disengaging from overseas involvement:</hi> This
                            strategy would:</p>
                        <p>“a. Curtail U.S. overseas influence and decrease the visible
                            deterrent.</p>
                        <p>“b. Surrender the initiative.</p>
                        <p>“c. Permit concentration of resources in continental defense and
                            retaliatory capability.</p>
                        <p>“d. Permit the reduction of overseas deployments and bases.”</p>
                        <p>In response to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>,
                            both the President and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>
                            pointed out that paragraph 8 seemed to call essentially for a “Fortress
                            America” strategy. Still not satisfied, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> inquired whether paragraph 8
                            actually recommended that we renounce our treaties—such as <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>—and otherwise abandon the Free World and our security
                            commitments overseas. Or, on the other hand, was it merely a question of
                            the location of our armed forces? Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> went on to say that you could make a very good
                            argument that you did not actually need to station U.S. armed forces in
                            countries covered by <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that, as far as he could see, to carry out the
                            alternative in paragraph 8 meant that the United States abandoned
                            everything that it had believed in, and withdrew to the continental
                            United States. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            pointed out that it would be perfectly possible to carry out the courses
                            of action in subparagraphs 8–c and 8–d without abandoning our security
                            commitments to our allies overseas. Indeed, you could carry out these
                            two courses of action under existing national security policy without
                            impairing our worldwide security and political commitments. The
                            President paraphrased Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ words by stating that the Secretary meant that
                            we could <pb xml:id="pg_448" n="448" facs="0472"/>be just as deeply
                            involved morally in Europe as ever, even though meanwhile we had
                            redeployed our forces from Europe to the continental United States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> inquired of Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> whether he was
                            recommending serious consideration of the courses of action set forth in
                            subparagraphs 8–c and 8–d. Was the Secretary considering the possibility
                            of bringing more of our military personnel back home? Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied in the
                            affirmative, and the President agreed that this course of action was a
                            good idea when we were in a position to carry it out. He added that a
                            great many of our forces stationed abroad were deployed for political as
                            well as for military reasons.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he had a
                            somewhat different slant on the national strategy problem, and one that
                            was rather hard to express. He wondered if we could state a position
                            along these lines: The United States should make every effort to find a
                            common ground with the Soviet Union, which common ground would be
                            mutually advantageous, “in order to take some of the heat off the
                            world.” In other words, we should not just try to negotiate with the
                            Soviet Union in order to secure advantages for ourselves, but instead
                            try to achieve objectives in negotiation which would be advantageous
                            both to the United States and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> reassured Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> that the Planning
                            Board had his point in mind, and that the forthcoming discussion paper
                            on Political Issues would contain an exposition of this point.</p>

                        <p>At one point in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>’s
                            briefing, the President interrupted to point out, in connection with
                            Chart No. 2 (entitled “Summary of Budget Expenditures by Function,
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1950–<gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958”), that in case any members of the Council were
                            looking back with nostalgia to the low levels of defense expenditure
                            just prior to the Korean war, these people should be aware that one of
                            the reasons why the defense expenditures are so high now is because they
                            were so low in the period 1949 and 1950.</p>
                        <p>When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> had finished his
                            lengthy briefing, he called upon the Chairman of the Council of Economic

                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. Saulnier proceeded to speak in connection with Charts 7 and 8,
                            entitled “Gross National Product in 4th Quarter 1956 Prices”. He said he
                            would concentrate on the two models set forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/2 with respect to the two assumptions underlying
                            projections of the budget through Fiscal Year 1961. The objective here
                            was to try to see what lies ahead. Accordingly, Mr. Saulnier explained,
                            with reference to the chart, developments in the event of an
                            uninterrupted growth in the gross national product through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1961, and what the situation would look
                            like if allowance were made for an interruption of economic growth
                            beginning in mid-1958 of about the severity of the 1953–54
                            recession.</p>
                        <p>In the context of the implications of these projections, Mr. Saulnier
                            pointed out that he hadn’t tried any other models than the two set forth
                            on the chart in paragraph 4 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            5707/2, for one very good reason. What was the point of charting a more
                            serious recession or depression, in view of the fact that the budget
                            outlook is grim enough even under the assumption of the uninterrupted
                            growth of <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1961?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Saulnier recapitulated the budgetary outlook as follows: There was no
                            substantial outlook for improvement in the balance of receipts and
                            expenditures, even assuming uninterrupted growth of the economy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Saulnier concluded with remarks directed to paragraph 6 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/2. He said that with respect to
                            the vitality of our economy being enhanced by a tax reduction, he
                            believed that while our economy was carrying today a very heavy load of
                            taxation, the economy was able to bear this burden and, indeed, could
                            carry an even heavier burden if we were willing to a make the sacrifices
                            which would be <pb xml:id="pg_450" n="450" facs="0474"/>entailed. This
                            was not to say, he cautioned, that the American economy would not be
                            greatly stimulated if the tax burden could be reduced. It was for this
                            reason that, in the Planning Board discussion of the problem, he had
                            lined up on the side of those in the Planning Board who sponsored
                            alternative 6–a. The case for tax reduction, continued Mr. Saulnier,
                            could be stated in brief as follows: Greater incentives, the release of
                            funds for financing the expansion of the economy, and improvement in our
                            present tax structure, which has many inequitable and awkward features.
                            The best way to eliminate such inequities would be through a tax
                            reduction rather than by efforts to tinker with the existing tax
                            structure.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then called on Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> for an expression of
                            opinion on <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/2 and the charts
                            which had accompanied it.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> replied that he
                            thought that all these figures were interesting as an exercise.
                            Nevertheless, they were much more of an exercise than they were a guide
                            to action. He explained that he believed this to be the case because
                            initially what we were trying to do here at this meeting on this problem
                            was to correlate two unknown quantities, the first of which was the
                            magnitude and character of the Soviet threat to the United States. This
                            threat was constantly changing, as were the methods of the United States
                            in attempting to meet the threat. For example, a few years ago the
                            National Security Council had adopted a policy (the new look) which
                            called for a substantial reduction in the level of our armed forces and
                            a substantial redeployment of U.S. forces abroad back to the United
                            States. But nothing had ever really been done to carry out this new look
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> interposed to
                            object and to point out what had been accomplished by the Department of
                            Defense in implementing the so-called new look policy.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> then went on to
                            describe the other unknown quantity. No one, he said, could really tell
                            you precisely what the American economy can stand in the way of
                            expenditures over a long-run period. He agreed that we could raise taxes
                            if an actual emergency required this course of action. He could not
                            prove that our present tax levels are now so high as to be certain to
                            harm the American economy if these levels are maintained over a number
                            of years. Nevertheless, he believed this as an article of faith.</p>
                        <p>Quite apart from all this, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> insisted that we must take account of the
                            practicalities of the situation. Short of a greatly increased and more
                            obvious threat of war, it was going to be almost impossible for the
                            Administration to avoid a tax reduction over the next couple of years.
                            Domestic politics makes this almost certain. Indeed, only yesterday, on
                            the floor of the Senate, a tax reduction had <pb xml:id="pg_451" n="451" facs="0475"/>almost been voted. The reduction had been avoided
                            yesterday, but we are certain to get a tax cut in the United States in
                            the near future unless there is another real war scare.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> also warned the
                            Council that if we go back to deficit spending the result would be to
                            impair popular confidence in the Government and turn any mild recession
                            into something a good deal worse. Thus, in summary, none of the sets of
                            figures in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/2 and its
                            accompanying charts really proved anything, although we can certainly
                            discern a trend. In the light of the circumstances, the only safe course
                            for the Administration to pursue is to reduce both taxes and
                            expenditures.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then invited the
                            Director of the Bureau of the Budget to comment on Annex C to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/2, which consisted of projected
                            increases in total Federal expenditures from <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1961
                            which would result if present policies and programs were maintained but
                            no new programs were added. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> commented that the large increase in projected
                            expenditures to carry on existing approved programs had probably been
                            the most startling information coming to the Planning Board in the
                            course of their study of these issues.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> replied that the
                            budget projections were not “extremes”, but simply forecasts of
                            increasing expenditures under existing approved programs. Since the
                            situation envisaged was so serious, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> expressed the hope that the National Security
                            Council would take action at this meeting to correct the situation. He
                            went on to say that, regardless of the various individual policy
                            directives, the Bureau of the Budget was anxious for each department and
                            agency to come up with budget projections for the next several years
                            which would keep expenditures at a level not higher than the level of
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957 or <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> admitted that this would be hard for the
                            departments and agencies to do, but said that it would be extremely
                            helpful in achieving a consistent budget policy throughout all the
                            departments and agencies of the Executive Branch.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out at
                            once that <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/2 was a discussion
                            paper only, and not a per [<hi rend="italic">paper</hi>] which called
                            for Council action at the present time. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> also noted that there had been
                            an abundance of non-security expenditures figures in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/2 and its accompanying charts. The
                            National Security Council should concern itself with these non-security
                            expenditures as well as with expenditures for major national security
                            programs.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> replied that he had
                            already asked the departments and agencies responsible for other than
                            our security programs to make the budget projections which he had
                            mentioned. He was now asking the departments and agencies responsible
                            for our national security programs to follow suit.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_452" n="452" facs="0476"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he agreed
                            with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> that we
                            were certainly skating on very thin financial ice at the present time.
                            On the other hand, he couldn’t quite bring himself to agree with the
                            idea that we must project present levels of national security
                            expenditures forever into the future.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> expressed the
                            opinion that if one looked carefully at the figures showing the yearly
                            increase in gross national product from 1939 to the present, one would
                            find that the increase was almost exactly in relation to the
                            depreciation in the value of the dollar during this same period. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> disagreed, and said
                            that perhaps 50% of the increase in <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>
                            would be accounted for by the depreciation in the value of the dollar.
                            Mr. Saulnier also argued that there had been at least a modest increase
                            in real <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> expressed skepticism that the
                            figures set forth in the paper and in the charts proved that a high
                            level of taxation necessarily deprived the economy of a healthy growth.
                            In certain years the economy seemed to grow most rapidly when taxes were
                            heaviest.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> thought that the
                            big problem was how to stabilize the American economy in order to avoid
                            either inflation or deflation. He then proceeded to defend the size of
                            the Defense Department budget for Fiscal Year 1958. In accordance with
                            the President’s wishes, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said, he had tried to keep projected expenditures
                            down to the absolute safe minimum. He had even slashed over a billion
                            dollars from the budget at the last minute. Thereafter, he was suddenly
                            confronted with increased wages for civilian employees of the Defense
                            Department. In addition, there were steady price rises, particularly in
                            steel. This was followed by the Hungary and the Israeli-Egyptian
                            outbreak. Under the circumstances, he had done the best he could.</p>
                        <p>The President suggested that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> was getting off the question. The question, said
                            the President, is whether expenditures for a machine tool are more
                            useful than expenditures for a tank, so far as a healthy American
                            economy is concerned. Certainly we in this Administration have done our
                            utmost to keep expenditures down. We now feel a certain sense of defeat.
                            Yet no one had ever really suggested to the President any program that
                            he would willingly abandon—schools, medical services, national security,
                            or anything else. Accordingly, the President concluded that the
                            objectives suggested by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> were, for the present, the most we could hope
                            for.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he certainly
                            did not wish to quarrel with his good friend Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, but he did feel rather
                            defensive about the Defense Department budget. Nevertheless, neither he
                            nor Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> could see
                            how in the future we could afford to carry out presently-approved
                            Department of Defense programs if we were to follow Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName>’s suggestion that expenditures
                            through 1960 <pb xml:id="pg_453" n="453" facs="0477"/>be maintained at
                            levels no higher than obtained in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1957. If this level were to be maintained, we should have to cut or
                            eliminate presently-approved programs.</p>
                        <p>In reply, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said
                            that of course he was not criticizing any single individual. On the
                            other hand, we as a group must realize that we have got to stand for the
                            interests of all the American people against vocal pressure groups of
                            all kinds. These vocal groups, which began in the Roosevelt
                            Administrations, made demands both in the military and the non-military
                            fields and thus pushed expenditures upward.</p>
                        <p>The President reminded Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> that no Administration programs had been sent
                            to the Congress without the President’s own explicit approval. In many
                            instances he had given his approval to an Administration program simply
                            in order to head off a worse program which would have been formulated by
                            the Congress itself. The President went on to comment about the unhappy
                            situation with respect to the severe Congressional cut in the budget of
                            the Federal Civil Defense Administration. In view of what Congress had
                            done to this comparatively modest program, the President invited the
                            members of the Council to imagine what would happen if an atomic bomb
                            were dropped on Kansas City. Indignation would be furious and bitter
                            because the Government had not adequately protected the civilian
                            population.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President pointed out that the effect of the present economy
                            drive in Congress was unlikely to mean in the long run a very
                            substantial budget cut—certainly not over $1 billion. Nevertheless, this
                            economy drive would serve to put a brake on enlarged future programs.
                            Accordingly, if we could achieve the objective mentioned earlier by Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName>, of placing a
                            ceiling on future expenditures, there would be great advantages.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> stated that
                            there were two things which the National Security Council should clearly
                            realize before it left this subject. The first was how do we and other
                            nations keep working toward the objective of living together in this
                            world without transforming the world into an armed camp? Secondly, how
                            can we make genuine progress toward disarmament so that the costs of
                            armaments can properly be less? The President commented that we still
                            have not exploited trade as much as we might in finding an answer to the
                            first of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>’s
                            questions.</p>
                        <p>Before the discussion ended, the Vice President said he wished to
                            underline one more point. The darkest aspect of the present economy
                            drive in Congress is Congressional insistence on cutting the budget for
                            foreign assistance and for informational and cultural exchange. These,
                            said the Vice President, are the fields for which expenditures should be
                            increased rather than cut.</p>

                            the Council.</p>
                        <p>Using the same charts which the President had seen in Bermuda,<note n="11" xml:id="d112fn11">Reference is to the meetings between

                                volume XXVII.</note> Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> first discussed the Thor (<gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>) program. He indicated the timing and
                            the quantities of missiles which would be involved if Thor were finally
                            chosen as the intermediate range missile. He explained that missiles
                            which would be produced under this program for inventory and actual use
                            would be “peeled off” from the missiles produced for testing. The
                            missiles for inventory would provide nothing more than an initial
                            operating capability. There was an admitted risk, said Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName>, in the beginning to
                            place into the inventory weapons like the Thor before they were
                            completely tested out, but this was a matter of saving time. The
                            totality of the present program for obtaining an initial operational
                            capability for the <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> consisted of
                            four squadrons, each squadron containing fifteen weapons.</p>
                        <p>The President indicated that he clearly understood the program which had
                            been described by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName>, who then went on to discuss in a similar
                            fashion the two <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> programs—the Atlas
                            and the Titan. The initial operational capability for the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> was eight squadrons, with ten
                            missiles in each squadron.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> interrupted to
                            point out the great difficulty at present of trying to decide between
                            the Atlas and the Titan missiles, and why for the present the Defense
                            Department was developing programs for both these missiles.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_455" n="455" facs="0479"/>
                        <p>The President called for a report from the Department of Defense which
                            would assume reasonable success in both the long-range and the
                            short-range ballistic missile programs. Under this assumption the
                            President asked that a report be prepared which would set forth the
                            military advantages, as opposed to the psychological advantages, which
                            would derive from having these missiles in place of the manned aircraft
                            which would exist at the same time.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said he
                            supposed the President was aiming at what we would feel safe in cutting
                            out if the missile programs proved a success.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then invited Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> to read to the
                            National Security Council his recommendations for Council action, which
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> proceeded to
                            do. The President expressed approval of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName>’ recommendations, but directed
                            an addition to these recommendations which would state clearly that if
                            any changes were deemed necessary in the currently-approved program,
                            such changes must be brought back to the National Security Council for
                            consideration prior to being put into effect.</p>

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RII1">Rabi</persName> recalled the last meeting
                            of the group with the President,<note n="10" xml:id="d113fn10">Reference
                                is to a previous meeting between the Science Advisory Committee and
                                the President. No record of this meeting has been found in the
                                Eisenhower Library or Department of State files.</note> and the
                            inspirations which that meeting gave to their work. He said the group
                            feels that it is reaching another turning point, and asked what the
                            President might have in his mind for them.</p>
                        <p>The President stressed the valuable contribution they have made, and said
                            he would certainly hope there would be no falling-off in enthusiasm. He
                            hopes that they find their work challenging and interesting. The
                            President mentioned the importance of re-evaluating war as an instrument
                            of policy, and added that he studies and reflects at great length on how
                            to deter war—which has now become so destructive.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RII1">Rabi</persName> mentioned a few of the
                            things that concern the group. He felt that the military services may be
                            carrying on functions based on obsolete items, long beyond the point of
                            justification. He said that support by Defense of basic research is
                            declining—there is a constant budget, but costs are rising so that real
                            effort is going down. Defense is not venturing “risk capital” for future
                            innovation. There tends to be a narrow focus on specific weapons
                            systems, as against a search for basic information which might have
                            application all across the board.</p>
                        <p>The President said he had a question regarding this deduction—it is
                            where, in a society like ours, responsibility should be placed for basic
                            research. Where is the dividing line between the efforts that should
                            fall to government and those that should fall to universities and
                            industry. He said he would be greatly helped by a set of simple yard
                            sticks.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RII1">Rabi</persName> agreed with a statement
                            by the President concerning duplication of effort. He said he had the
                            impression that there is much duplication and much irrelevance in the
                            present programs. He thought it was a mistake, however, to take basic
                            research wholly out of the Defense Department. This is a function that
                            cannot be handled just by liaison; people must be engaged and immersed
                            in research themselves. He added that the amount of funds is not large,
                            and went on to say that there was some indication that people are
                            fearful that basic research would open up fruitful new lines for
                            developmental research, <pb xml:id="pg_458" n="458" facs="0482"/>thus
                            adding to effort and expense. He said that the Defense Department needs
                            this information if its developmental research is to be well planned. He
                            concluded this statement by saying that this is one of the last places
                            to try to economize, and that we should not try to define the area of
                            investigation too narrowly. He called on Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> to comment, and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> brought out the analogy with
                            great industrial firms, who find that their research money best spent is
                            that which is spent on basic research. The President pointed out that
                            the industrial firms have the measuring factor of profit to work
                            against, and this is lacking in the government. Mr. Berkner said that,
                            in defense research, the rate of effort at $2 billion a year is
                            exhausting the store of basic ideas. The President said he understood
                            that about $5¼ billion was going into research and development when all
                            things were added in. He thought that the group might advise him as to
                            what should be the balance between research and development. Mr. Land
                            said that in industry there is a constant tendency for the operators to
                            take from research and give to development. The President of the company
                            personally must hold out research funds. He said that the competitors
                            one fears in industry are those firms—often small ones—with a big and
                            vigorous research program. Finally, he added that if a company in
                            industry does not have its own research, it becomes “stupid and clumsy”
                            in its development efforts. He asserted that only the President could
                            assure proper emphasis on research.</p>
                        <p>The President said he does not feel that all of this basic research
                            belongs in the Defense Department—since it has a wider purpose than
                            weapons alone. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RII1">Rabi</persName> said that
                            what is sought is simply <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> support on
                            the principle of basic research. Then the group can set the proper
                            dimensions for it. The squeeze is coming from a fixed budget in a time
                            of rising costs. The President said he accepts the importance of basic
                            research; but retains the question to what extent does the federal
                            government have responsibility—to what extent is it desirable for the
                            federal government to enter the field. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RII1">Rabi</persName> commented on a point suggested by the President,
                            and said that governmental support of research has not to date infringed
                            on freedom. He said that we are now using our technological reserves to
                            the full. There is no reserve of new ideas. He felt that unless we use
                            our resources most effectively as between basic and developmental
                            research, we may find our resources fully committed, with inadequate
                            supplies of new ideas being generated.</p>
                        <p>The President reviewed the policy we have been following for ten years or
                            more. It is to develop within the various areas and regions of the free
                            world indigenous forces for the maintenance of order, the safeguarding
                            of frontiers, and the provision of the bulk of ground capability. The
                            United States develops the technical forces, particularly air and naval
                            forces, to move in in case the need exceeds what the <pb xml:id="pg_459" n="459" facs="0483"/>local nation can itself provide. This must be
                            kept highly mobile. He was sure that the United States could not
                            maintain old-fashioned forces all around the world. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RII1">Rabi</persName> said that one thing the group was
                            concerned about was the supposition that the Soviets might supply
                            advanced weapons to the North Koreans. A great threat would then exist,
                            and we might be obliged to meet it in Korea. We would not want to
                            provoke all-out war by an attack at the centers of power. The President
                            reaffirmed that we must avoid putting sizable forces into the area, with
                            great logistical establishments behind them. We would be tied down and
                            would be unable to meet rising problems in other areas.</p>

                            Intelligence Estimate 100–5–57 on the foreign reaction to the adoption
                            by the United States of a large-scale shelter program. At the conclusion
                            of his briefing, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> called
                            on the Director of Defense Mobilization for his comments.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> said that the shelter
                            program was one in a whole range of problems of the non-military defense
                            of the continental United States. He believed that members of the
                            Executive Branch, as well as members of Congress, had taken a “spotty
                            approach” to the problem of shelter up to the present time. Some of
                            these individuals took a shelter program very seriously; others
                            dismissed it out of hand. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>
                            said that he personally took all such measures of non-military defense
                            very seriously, because he believed that these measures constituted a
                            genuine deterrent to war by the Soviet Union. In any event, it was clear
                            to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>, he said, that we need
                            forthright policy with respect to shelter, whereas at the present time
                            we are at a kind of halfway point between a policy calling for
                            evacuation of target areas and a policy of providing shelter. It was
                            also clear to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> that up
                            until the present time most of us had had an “all or nothing” approach
                            to the problem of shelter against nuclear attack; that is, we tended to
                            say that if we cannot afford to spend $32 billion (as advocated by the
                                <gloss target="#t_FCDA1">FCDA</gloss> shelter program), there was no
                            point in spending anything on a shelter program. Accordingly, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> endorsed the Planning
                            Board’s recommendations for the development of studies which would get
                            the relevant facts together. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> said that the Science Advisory Committee of <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> was very willing to undertake the study
                            assigned to it in the recommendations of the Planning Board in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5709. However, the Committee was not
                            sure that it would be able to complete the study that was called for by
                            the suggested date of July 1, 1957.</p>
                        <p>On a narrower point, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> said,
                            he personally felt that it had been a great mistake to permit the
                            erection of new Federal Government buildings without any provision in
                            them for shelter. The reasons for this lapse, he thought, was that no
                            one has been assigned the authority to direct the inclusion of shelters,
                            and he accordingly recommended that the President assign such authority
                            somewhere in the Executive Branch. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> concluded his comments by supporting the
                            recommendations set forth by the Planning Board in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5709.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then called on the
                            Federal Civil Defense Administrator for his views.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName> expressed himself
                            as in thorough agreement with the Planning Board’s recommendations in
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5709, and stated his belief that
                            in studying the feasibility of a shelter program we should proceed very
                            slowly and with deliberation. However, with respect to all the different
                            cost estimates for the several shelter programs that had been mentioned
                            (his own, that of Dr. Teller, and that <pb xml:id="pg_461" n="461" facs="0485"/>of the Naval Radiological Laboratory), Governor
                                <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName> said he was obliged
                            to point out that there are about ten different cost components in any
                            shelter program. The total cost figure, therefore, depended on how many
                            of these cost components were included in the total estimate. He cited
                            as examples whether the cost components included the provision of food
                            and water in the shelters, the provision of bedding, medical supplies,
                            etc., etc.. Accordingly, no one really has a very clear idea of what any
                            given shelter program will ultimately cost.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName> also suggested
                            that the Council bear in mind what alternatives are open to us if we
                            have or do not have a shelter program. It was certainly the feeling of
                                <gloss target="#t_FCDA1">FCDA</gloss> that if any shelter program
                            were undertaken it should proceed slowly and deliberately. <gloss target="#t_FCDA1">FCDA</gloss> also was strongly in favor of
                            dual-use shelters; for example, shelters which might serve as
                            underground garages in the event that they were never put to use for
                            their primary purpose of shelter from nuclear attack.</p>
                        <p>With respect to our previous policy of evacuation of our people from
                            target areas, Governor <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName>
                            pointed out that this policy had been proposed and adopted before we
                            realized the full magnitude of the problem of radioactive fallout. In
                            the present circumstances it was, of course, foolish to talk about
                            tactical evacuation of a target area; although if strategic warning were
                            available we could certainly “thin out” our cities in advance of the
                            attack.</p>
                        <p>In concluding, Governor <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Peterson</persName>
                            said he had one more thing to say. While he clearly realized the fiscal
                            implications of a large-scale shelter program, no one could tell him
                            that the United States could not afford to spend $3.2 billion each year
                            for ten years for a shelter program if securing the shelter program
                            really meant the survival of the United States in the event of a nuclear
                            attack.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> said he wanted to be
                            sure that the Council understood that the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning Board had neither taken a position against nor
                            in favor of a shelter program. The Planning Board was merely convinced
                            that it needed a great deal more information on the subject before it
                            could make an informed recommendation to the Council. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then asked the Secretary of State
                            for his views.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that it
                            struck him that any such extensive shelter program would be extremely
                            costly. In his opinion, we would obtain a much more effective defensive
                            capability if we added the money which such a shelter program would cost
                            to the budget of the Department of Defense in order that it might be
                            used to increase our deterrent military capabilities.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then called on the
                            Acting Secretary of the Treasury for any comments which he might wish to
                            make on <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5709.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_462" n="462" facs="0486"/>
                        <p>Secretary Burgess<note n="4" xml:id="d114fn4">W. Randolph Burgess, Under
                                Secretary of the Treasury.</note> replied that he had no comment to
                            make except to state that the Treasury would be happy to undertake the
                            study suggested for it in paragraph 7–d of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5709. But he had serious doubts whether any “tricks”
                            that could be devised in such a study would save the Government from
                            assuming most of the burden of the cost of a shelter program.</p>
                        <p>When asked for his views, Acting Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> stated that he agreed in
                            general with the position of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>. He believed that large expenditures devoted to a
                            shelter program would tend to undermine our military deterrent to a
                            Soviet attack by taking away money needed to maintain and develop the
                            deterrent. He did feel, however, that shelters should be built in new
                            industrial plants and in new Government buildings.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then explained to the
                            Council the serious dilemma that the Administration would find itself in
                            if, when the issue finally became clear, the Administration had nothing
                            to say one way or another with respect to a shelter program. This would
                            put the Administration in an indefensible position.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that he
                            did not believe that it would be “indefensible” to tell the American
                            public plainly that there was no really effective (passive) protection
                            against nuclear attack on the continental United States. After all, we
                            have had to acknowledge that we have been wrong in adopting a policy
                            which called for the evacuation of target areas. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> repeated his view that the best
                            way to spend our resources and direct our efforts was on active measures
                            of deterrence, so that we could be sure that the enemy would not dare to
                            attack. Thus, if there must be a choice between static defense measures
                            and active measures to deter attack, there was no real choice, and this
                            fact would be readily understood by the American people. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> added that he thought
                            there would be some use in a program which called for the inclusion of
                            shelters in newly-erected public buildings, but he reiterated his
                            opposition to any large-scale shelter program.</p>
                        <p>The President, turning to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, asked him to suppose a situation in which, ten
                            years from now, the United States and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> each had obtained all the hydrogen weapons it could
                            wish. Suppose also that one of the two protagonists was ready to dig in
                            and stick out a nuclear war, whereas the other protagonist was not. The
                            side which had the shelters to take refuge in was likely to win the war
                            after the initial exchange of nuclear blows. Nevertheless, the President
                            added that he leaned toward Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ views for the moment at least, although this
                            matter of shelters was a very serious problem. The President added that,
                            as he had been saying for the last five years, <pb xml:id="pg_463" n="463" facs="0487"/>war is currently coming to such a state that it
                            is no longer war in any traditional sense, but rather a contest between
                            death and survival. This was the consideration which had earlier induced
                            him to call together the panel of scientist and scholars who made the
                            study of the Human Effects of Nuclear Weapons Development.<note n="5" xml:id="d114fn5">See <ref target="#d96">Document 96</ref>.</note>
                            The President added that he thought that the studies called for in
                            paragraph 7 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5709 should be
                            undertaken as a matter of urgency, but leaving to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> and the Planning Board the
                            determination of the precise dates for the completion of these
                            studies.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> added the comment
                            that he had seen an advance copy of the British White Paper on the
                            problem of the defense of Britain in a nuclear war.<note n="6" xml:id="d114fn6">A copy of the British White Paper, entitled
                                “Outline of Future Policy,” published on April 4, is in Department
                                of State, Central Files, 741.5/4–557. It was printed in <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi>, April 5, 1957, p.
                                4.</note> The British reasoning was along the lines earlier
                            suggested by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>.
                            The British felt that they could not afford both an elaborate passive
                            defense program as well as a program which called for building an active
                            deterrent to nuclear attack. Accordingly, in the White Paper they had
                            come out strongly in support of the deterrent program for the defense of
                            the British Isles.</p>

                        <p>At the conclusion of Secretary McNeil’s report on the mobilization base
                            program, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> indicated that
                            the Department of Defense would be prepared to give the Council a much
                            more detailed report early in June on the same subject.<note n="9" xml:id="d116fn9">The Department of Defense made no presentation to

                            Council turn to the last subject covered in the paper on the military
                            elements of national strategy (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            5707/3), because this would follow logically on Secretary McNeil’s
                            previous presentation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>
                            read paragraph 14, which briefly described the new military planning
                            concept in relation to the mobilization base, and paragraph 15, which
                            covered the questions which the Planning Board wished to raise in order
                            to obtain guidance for the part of the revised basic national security
                            policy which would be concerned with the mobilization base. Paragraphs
                            14 and 15 read as follows:</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> asked Secretary McNeil
                            if he could attempt to answer question 15–a. Secretary McNeil replied
                            that the new mobilization base required for forces which would be
                            mobilized by M + 6 would be smaller and more selective than our
                            mobilization base had been in the past. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> commented that when this
                            Administration first came into power the Defense Department officers
                            found themselves <pb xml:id="pg_468" n="468" facs="0492"/>confronted
                            with a very large mobilization base plan. In the years since 1953 it had
                            proved very difficult to back out of this larger mobilization base plan,
                            but progress was now being made in getting off this wicket.</p>
                        <p>With reference to a statement in Secretary McNeil’s report, on the number
                            of rounds of 155 mm. ammunition which had been procured by the Defense
                            Department for the mobilization base, Director <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> inquired whether anybody could
                            describe the kind of future war in which the United States would be
                            likely to use 11,000,000 rounds of 155 mm. ammunition. The President
                            seemed impatient, and said let the whole thing go to hell in a basket;
                            it would require a great big academic study.</p>
                        <p>In further comment on the difficulties of making economies, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> stated that there were
                            still veterinaries in our armed forces although there were no horses.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he could
                            not seem to get rid of these people. Amidst much amusement, the
                            President defended the presence of these veterinaries, on the ground
                            that they were needed to inspect the meat (not always
                            Government-inspected prime beef) which our soldiers ate. Returning to a
                            serious vein, the President said that of course we have had a very
                            lopsided mobilization base, and that it had got to be completely
                            changed. He said that, for instance, he was strongly opposed to the
                            maintenance of stand-by plants as part of our mobilization base.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that he had
                            started two years ago to begin to break up the packages of machine
                            tools. Among other things, he discovered that we were maintaining tools
                            for aviation engines which we were sure we would never again use.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the mobilization base, the President said that the basic
                            decision as to its nature would depend on whether, in the face of a
                            future war, we were going to have to be concerned about our national
                            security for a period of only 90 days, or whether we should have to
                            provide for a longer period. The President stated that he believed
                            personally that if the United States could survive a future war for a
                            period of 90 days, we would be in a good position to pull through any
                            subsequent period of warfare. On the other hand, the President said, he
                            did not object to 5-year planning for the stockpiling of raw materials,
                            he explained, because a future war would be so devastating that it might
                            take this country that long a time to get back into production of
                            essential raw materials.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> commented that
                            the whole matter seemed academic to him, since the country had 5-year
                            stockpiles in nearly every category.</p>
                        <p>At this point, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> said that
                            paragraph 15–d of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/3 concerned
                            itself precisely with the possibility of revising our existing stockpile
                            objectives, now based on 3- and 5-year requirements. The <pb xml:id="pg_469" n="469" facs="0493"/>President stated that we should
                            not add to the existing 3- and 5-year requirements, but that we should
                            not dump on the market stockpile materials we have at hand.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then asked the Council
                            to look at question 15–b, and asked the President for his views on the
                            adequacy of the proposed new mobilization base to support a limited war
                            as opposed to an all-out war. The President repeated views he had
                            expressed in the past: that even if we got into a limited war we would
                            immediately call for a general mobilization and full controls, which we
                            would gradually get rid of subsequently just as fast as we could. If we
                            did not put on tight controls at the very beginning of the conflict,
                            everything would skyrocket.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> went on to read
                            paragraph 15–c, explaining the views of certain members of the Planning
                            Board that mobilization base requirements for military operations short
                            of a general war were more important than the requirements for the
                            subsequent phase of general war. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> asked Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> for an expression of his opinion on the question
                            asked in 15–c.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> replied that he
                            found that all these questions contributed more to confusion than to
                            clarification. The authors of the questions did not seem to understand
                            how the military people have operated in the development of the
                            mobilization base. In this matter the mobilization base is designed in
                            the first instance to provide for the initial phase of general war and
                            provision for that phase would cover pretty thoroughly the resources
                            which would be required for a local or limited war. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that he too found himself
                            confused over semantics and words in these questions. It seemed clear to
                            him that the United States would never become involved in a limited war
                            with the Soviet Union and, moreover, the United States would not pick on
                            small nations and thus begin a small war. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> said he agreed with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> that we would not become
                            involved in a small war by picking on some small nation, but we might
                            nevertheless be drawn into a small war by circumstances beyond our
                            control. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> replied
                            that if this were proved to be the case, the war into which the United
                            States got drawn would not remain a small war.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that the matters about which the Council had been
                            talking up till now would receive no final answer until the officials of
                            the Department of Defense and the Office of Defense Mobilization got
                            together and thought through the problem of a rational mobilization base
                            for the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Director of Defense Mobilization, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gordon Gray</persName>, said he found difficulty in understanding
                            the meaning of the term “the subsequent phases of general war”. The
                            demands of a future war, he believed, would not stop at the end of 90
                            days. If the actual fighting were over by that time, the President
                            pointed out, there would of course still <pb xml:id="pg_470" n="470" facs="0494"/>be the problem of rehabilitation. The President went on
                            to say that he could hardly envisage any massive offensive occurring
                            after the 90-day initial phase of general war. Resources which had not
                            been used up in that 90-day period would have to be devoted to
                            rehabilitation.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> observed that in
                            formulating the budgets of the Department of Defense for the fiscal
                            years 1959 and beyond under the President’s $39 billion ceiling,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> proposed to take
                            into account three major elements: First, the $39 billion ceiling on new
                            obligational authority; second, estimated cash expenditure; and third,
                            force levels. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>
                            added that it seemed to him essential to make a reduction in the force
                            levels. The President suggested that we had better wait until Congress
                            has begun to consider the appropriation requests of the Department of
                            Defense for the next fiscal year.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> then turned to
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> and asked whether
                            the planning basis which he had just mentioned appeared satisfactory to
                            the Director of the Budget. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> replied that this question depended on how
                            large a tax cut we would want to have next year. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> replied that the field of tax
                            cuts was not his responsibility.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> counseled that
                            we must all take a very practical view of what our domestic situation
                            demands and what our people would insist upon. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that we would agree to this
                            if Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> would
                            include also taking account in our budget of the international situation
                            which confronted the country. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> expressed the belief that the United States could
                            readily stand the present tax burden and the present level of
                            expenditures for national defense for an indefinite period if this
                            proved to be necessary. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said he agreed with this proposition, but
                            warned that if we were to do this we would be required to keep the
                            country thoroughly scared at successive time intervals. The President
                            remarked that in the course of the last few years he had not received a
                            single letter which advocated a reduction in the budget of the
                            Department of Defense. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that there was no need for us to scare
                            Americans; the Russians can be depended upon to do that.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that
                            nevertheless the Administration was going to have a hell of a time to
                            prevent a tax reduction right now. In fact, in his view, the only way to
                            prevent Small Business from getting $600,000,000 worth of tax relief
                            would be for the President to veto this Congressional proposal. The
                            President turned to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> and asked him how much he would be willing to
                            pay to save his life. Of course, added the President, in paying what was
                            necessary for our national survival we should in turn reduce
                            expenditures for other types of programs. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> replied that of <pb xml:id="pg_471" n="471" facs="0495"/>course we should pay what we
                            need to pay in order to survive, but the point of the matter was that we
                            did not cut other programs which did not involve our national
                            security.</p>
                        <p>The President then called for the next question, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> said that the Council would
                            perhaps best now go back to the first problem set forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/3, which concerned our capability
                            to oppose local aggression. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> read this section of the paper, as follows:</p>
                        <p>“<hi rend="italic">Existing policy</hi> calls for U.S. ready forces
                            which, with such help as may be realistically expected from our allies,
                            are adequate to deter or cope with local aggression, pending application
                            of additional U.S. and allied power, in a way calculated to avoid
                            hostilities broadening into general war, and which are sufficiently
                            versatile to use either conventional or nuclear weapons as circumstances
                            dictate.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>“a. Are we devoting adequate effort and resources to developing doctrine
                            and ready forces best calculated to deal with local war without our
                            enhancing the risk of spreading nuclear conflict?</p>
                        <p>“b. Will current plans for increasing integration of nuclear weapons into
                            U.S. forces soon make the united States unable to participate in
                            opposing local aggression without nuclear weapons?</p>
                        <p>“<hi rend="italic">4. Alternatives.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>“a. In addition to our present capabilities, possess a separate
                            non-nuclear capability for conducting successful local wars under all
                            predictable circumstances.</p>
                        <p>“b. Without increasing our over-all effort, sacrifice some part of our
                            other military capability in order to increase our local war capability

                        <p>“c. Concentrate substantially all of our military resources on the

                            now that in military operations short of general war, nuclear weapons
                            will be used when required in order to achieve military objectives.”</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (16 lines of source text) not
                                declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>When asked by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> for his
                            views on this subject, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> stated that the President had just outlined the
                            way the planning of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had been developing ever
                            since 1953. The military saw no alternative to such planning. He added
                            that it was very easy to formulate the questions which the Planning
                            Board had set down, but extremely hard to answer them. How, for example,
                            would we define the term “local aggression”? The Joint Chiefs of Staff
                            had to be much more definite and clear when they made use of such
                            terms.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (4 lines of source text) not
                                declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_472" n="472" facs="0496"/>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> went on to say
                            that the Defense Department and the Joint Chiefs of Staff were in fact
                            now engaged in carrying out a policy that, in any action in which U.S.
                            forces were involved, we would make use of nuclear weapons if it proved
                            necessary. Accordingly, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> called for a clearly-written directive in our
                            basic policy so that we would in the future avoid the confusion on the
                            subject which comes from papers such as <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/3.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> defended with warmth the
                            validity of the questions set forth by the Planning Board, after which
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> commented that
                            the United States had at the present time very powerful military force,
                            much of which was conventional in character. Whether we would need to go
                            beyond the use of conventional weapons to the point of atomic weapons,
                            would depend on the size and character of the local war in which we were
                            involved. The particular advantage which the use of atomic weapons gives
                            us is the capability to defend against being overrun in the future as we
                            were in the initial phases of the Korean war.</p>
                        <p>The President pointed out firmly that the revision of basic national
                            security policy offered us our chance to write the right kind of
                            directive in the matter of the use of atomic weapons. He said he did not
                            think it appropriate to blame the Planning Board for asking these
                            questions. What was important was to see to it that from now on our
                            basic policy gets into line with the planning which had been going on in
                            the Department of Defense for over two years. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> warmly endorsed the
                            President’s suggestion. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> recalled that representatives of the Department
                            of Defense had strongly opposed the statement of existing policy
                            summarized in paragraph 2 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/3
                            when our current basic national security policy (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602/1) had been adopted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> added that the real
                            problem has been that so far the cost for the so-called new weapons have
                            always been additive. There has been no corresponding subtraction.
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> denied that this
                            had been the case, and pointed out that one bomber built today could
                            accomplish as much as ten thousand bombers could accomplish in 1945.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he would very much like to see a draft of a
                            revised statement of the military elements of our national strategy as
                            written in the Defense Department. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> advised the President that such a draft would
                            appear in the final version of our revised basic national security
                            policy, which the Council would consider some time in May.<note n="10" xml:id="d116fn10">For the discussion of the final version, which
                                became <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/8, see <ref target="#d119">Document 119</ref>.</note> Meanwhile, however, he
                            pointed out that the State Department had a certain interest in this
                            policy area. Indeed, this fact had <pb xml:id="pg_473" n="473" facs="0497"/>been emphasized by the action of the Council last week
                            in holding the new Korean policy in abeyance until we could ascertain
                            the effect on our allies of a course of action which would involve
                            modernizing our forces in Korea with purely atomic weapons. The
                            President said that the Council’s action in holding up the paper on
                            Korea was related to a specific international agreement in the <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">shape</gloss> of the Korean Armistice Agreement.
                            It had nothing to do with the general issue of whether or not to equip
                            our U.S. forces with nuclear capabilities. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> observed that Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> felt that we still
                            needed a considerable degree of flexibility in the weaponry of our armed
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>The President stated very clearly his opinion that we had now reached a
                            point in time when our main reliance, though not our sole reliance,
                            should be on nuclear weapons. Up until recently our main reliance has
                            been on conventional forces, to which we have added here and there in
                            various units atomic capabilities. This situation must henceforth be
                            revised.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> expressed the
                            view that the outbreak of local wars was not the big problem which we
                            faced in the world of today. The most dangerous problem was that of
                            Communist subversion of weak and newly-developing nations. Reference to
                            this problem, he thought, should be included in the paper. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out that the point was
                            touched on later, and Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> went on to say
                            that he greatly feared that Congress would cut the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> budget to bits and that this would have
                            a serious effect on our anti-subversion programs in weak nations.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that he really did not know what more he could do
                            in defense of the budget. He made statements on the subject practically
                            every day.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> at this point suggested
                            that the Council turn to the next major problem, which related to the
                            U.S. alliance system, and which read as follows:</p>
                        <p>“5. <hi rend="italic">Existing policy</hi> is predicated upon the support
                            and cooperation of appropriate allies and other free countries in
                            furnishing bases for U.S. military power and in providing their share of
                            military forces. It visualizes progressive integration of nuclear
                            weapons into <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defenses only, with
                            the United States retaining custody of warheads prior to
                            hostilities.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> offered the opinion that
                            the most serious question was posed by paragraph 7–b above, and asked
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> if he would care
                            to comment on the alternative set forth in that paragraph.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> observed that we
                            were already committed to this action and had already gone down that
                            road as far as our law would permit. For the time being, Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> thought that the law
                            which prevented us from giving nuclear warheads to our allies was
                            helpful, and he would not advise too hurried a change in the law. He
                            repeated, however, that the alternatives in paragraph 7 do not really
                            exist, because we have already gone too far down the road. Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> also expressed the
                            view that the thought in paragraph 6–b was much too pessimistic, and
                            that we did not need to worry too much about Soviet blackmailing of our
                            allies in order to render our overseas bases in their territories
                            untenable. The President seemed to agree with Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>, in pointing out that the
                            Soviets had been writing the same threatening letters to our allies as
                            long as six years ago. The President added, however, that he would like
                            to see a change in the law so that, for one thing, we could prevent
                            powers which do not now have the capability of making nuclear weapons
                            from developing that capability [<hi rend="italic">23 words not
                                declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName> observed that our
                            allies seemed generally content to have the custody of warheads for
                            atomic weapons remain in the hands of the United States provided we
                            supplied these allies with the weapons to which the warheads could be
                            added in case of necessity. Accordingly, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName> expressed his agreement with
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> that it was not
                            desirable to change the law on this subject at this time, although it
                            might be desirable later. On this last point, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName> said he was somewhat surprised
                            to discover considerable sentiment in the Joint Atomic Energy Committee
                            of Congress in favor of a change of law which would permit the United
                            States to provide the British with nuclear warheads. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> predicted we would come to the
                            point where we would do this, but the timing of the action was extremely
                            important.</p>

                        <p>At the conclusion of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>’s
                            briefing, the President observed that the Director of Central
                            Intelligence had a few minutes ago brought up the problem of the
                            weakness of the governments of many of the newly-independent nations,
                            and the fact that they were prey to Communist subversion. Such new
                            governments are helpless unless they have the power to maintain internal
                            order and security in their countries. That was all that we were trying
                            to do in these countries with our overseas internal security
                            program.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> referred to a
                            statement made by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> in
                            his briefing on this subject, which Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said had troubled him. It
                            related to the Operations Coordinating Board, which, said Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, he understood to be a
                            coordinating and not an operating agency. The President could, of
                            course, have asked the Department of Defense to take charge of the
                            overseas internal security program if he had wanted to.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_476" n="476" facs="0500"/>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> said he was
                            extremely anxious to explain the difference between overseas police-type
                            forces and regular military forces—a difference which as just as plain
                            as the differences between these two types of forces in the United
                            States. As a police-type force was gradually built up in a country like
                            Vietnam, for example, it would be possible to recall the regular
                            military forces from the remote villages and reconstitute them as a
                            regular military force. It would also be possible, as a result of the
                            building up of police-type forces, to keep the level of regular military
                            forces from getting any higher.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the question in paragraph 9, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> stated that the substance of
                            paragraph 9 should not have been put in the form of a question, but
                            rather in the form of an affirmative statement. Nevertheless, he warned
                            that we would still have to do a selling job if we were to induce the
                            governments of our friends and allies to reduce the level of their armed
                            forces in return for the modernization of the remaining forces with new
                            weapons. We are making some progress along this line, but a lot remains
                            to be done.</p>

                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> said he believed
                            it was a serious mistake to relate these two programs too closely,
                            because they were essentially quite different. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gordon Gray</persName> added his view that it was
                            likewise a mistake to let the notion persist that the 1290–d program
                            (now called the overseas internal security program) could effect great
                            savings in our military assistance programs generally. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> expressed agreement with Mr.

                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> replied that he
                            and, he believed, all the Chiefs of Staff were in agreement that at the
                            present time the United States needed overseas bases in certain areas
                            and under certain circumstances, although we are gradually moving into a
                            situation where dependence on overseas bases will be lessened. Indeed,
                            the Chiefs believed that it may be impossible for us to use certain
                            overseas bases in the future. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> added the thought that it might also be best for
                            the United States in the long run to pay rent for its overseas bases. In
                            any event, we should certainly try to reduce our reliance on overseas
                            bases, even though we may not be able to do so completely for some
                            time.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that our
                            policy should be to attempt to maintain such overseas bases as we have
                            at the present, but not in general to expand them, though of course
                            there would occasionally be exceptions. He noted that these overseas
                            bases had given very great concern to the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that the problem of our overseas bases was
                            something that we should have under constant study and review, because
                            some of these bases become less valuable as circumstances change.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> confirmed the
                            difficulty of negotiations with respect to overseas bases, citing the
                            instances of Portugal, Spain, and Morocco.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then invited the
                            Council’s attention to the fact that little time remained, and that some
                            attention should be given at this point to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/4, which was concerned with the military and
                            non-military aspects of continental defense. In the course of briefing
                            the Council on <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/4, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> read paragraphs 5 and 6, which
                            constitute, as he believed, the most significant statements of existing
                            national security policy with regard to continental defense. These
                            paragraphs read as follows:</p>
                        <p>“5. ‘The strength of the U.S. which must be so maintained is an <hi rend="italic">integrated complex of offensive and defense elements.
                                Each of these elements has its proper role in the defense of the
                                vitals of America against attack and destruction. … <note n="14" xml:id="d116fn14">Ellipsis in the source text.</note> We shall
                                not have satisfactory over-all strength if one element is allowed to

                            2–a, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5408)”</p>
                        <p>“6. ‘Just as there must be a proper balance among the several elements
                            comprising our strength, there must also be a proper balance between
                            military and non-military measures within the element of “continental
                            defense”.’ (Paragraph 2–b, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            5408)”</p>
                        <p>Thereafter, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> called
                            attention to the major new factors affecting the aforementioned policy
                            statements, which factors were described on page 2 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/4.<note n="15" xml:id="d116fn15">The “major new factors” affecting the above statements were
                                contained in the following paragraphs on page 2 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/4:<p>“10. Loss of the
                                    overwhelming nuclear superiority which the U.S. has possessed
                                    hitherto.</p>
                                <p>“11. Increasing net capabilities of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to damage the United States will threaten
                                    total national survival for the first time in U.S. history.</p>
                                <p>“12. Radioactive fallout as an after-effect of thermonuclear
                                    explosions vastly complicates both the military and non-military
                                    aspects of continental defense.” (Department of State, <gloss target="#t_SS1">S/S</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Files, Lot 63 D 351, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707 Memoranda)</p>
                            </note> He then turned to the policy questions which the Planning Board
                            felt had been raised by the new factors. He pointed out that the
                            questions in paragraphs 13 and 14 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            5707/4 could be passed over very briefly because the Council had only
                            recently authorized a series of studies on the problem of providing
                            shelter to protect the U.S. population from radioactive fallout and from
                            blast and fire hazard. He then read paragraph 15, as follows:</p>
                        <p>“15. In planning and executing our continental defense programs, should
                            additional emphasis be given to those measures designed to reduce the
                            vulnerability of our strategic retaliatory striking power?**</p>
                        <list type="simple">
                            <item>“** One member believes the following subparagraph should be

                            <item>“Is our early warning system being kept in phase with improvements

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then asked Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> for his
                            comments.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> replied that we
                            were already giving high priority to measures designed to reduce the
                            vulnerability of our strategic retaliatory striking power. The problem,
                            therefore, was not one so much of additional emphasis as the manner in
                            which we should try to reduce the vulnerability. This matter was the
                            subject of study at the present time by a committee in the Defense
                            Department. It was hoped that this committee would report its findings
                            by July 1. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>
                            warned, however, that the measures for reducing the vulnerability of our
                            retaliatory striking power would have to be adjusted under the
                            Department of Defense budget ceiling, as were all other Defense
                            Department programs.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> inquired as to whether
                            we were actually engaged in dispersing our <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> bases. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> replied in the affirmative, and Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> gave a brief
                            description of the dispersal program for <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> expressed the opinion that this was a
                            well-planned program, and he would not recommend further dispersal
                            measures at this time. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> also confirmed these views that the dispersal
                            program was sufficient as of the present time.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> inquired of
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> as to how far
                            our early warning network was proving effective. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> indicated that the committee
                            to which he had just referred was likewise studying this and, indeed,
                            the whole field of continental defense. Meanwhile, he believed, the
                            early warning network was steadily moving outward from the continental
                            borders. He briefly commented on progress with respect to the mid-Canada
                            line, the <gloss target="#t_DEW1">DEW</gloss> line, and certain other
                            elements of the early warning system. He predicted, however, that there
                            would be new and serious problems when we moved into the era of the
                            intercontinental ballistic missile.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> suggested that the
                            Council then give attention to paragraphs 16 and 17, which dealt with
                            the problem of securing an effective defense against the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> and the related problem of assuring
                            sufficient warning of the launching of an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> to permit the population to use shelter. The President
                            commented that sufficient unto the day was the evil thereof. He added
                            that he personally was doubtful if a course of action of pouring more
                            money into research and development would provide the answer either to
                            the interception of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s or the
                            warning of the launching of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s. The
                            President believed that the only way in which these terrible problems
                            would be solved would be through the functioning of some brilliant
                            scientific mind.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> next invited the
                            attention of the Council to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/6.
                            In the course of a short briefing, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out that the time was short, and that the
                            Council might desire to pass over questions 3, 4 and 5 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/6 on grounds that these questions
                            had previously been treated in prior discussion papers.<note n="3" xml:id="d117fn3">

                                maintaining <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> cohesion, the

                            Since the Council accepted Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>’s judgment, he invited their attention to the
                            sixth question, reading as follows:</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_481" n="481" facs="0505"/>
                        <p>“6. How can the United States help to make the UN a more effective
                            instrument for safeguarding the peace?</p>
                        <list type="simple">
                            <item>“a. Should the United States seek to create a permanent UN
                                military organization (or otherwise strengthen the UN as an
                                instrument for the settlement of international disputes)?</item>
                            <item>“b. In view of enlarged UN membership, (1) how can the United
                                States most effectively utilize UN machinery to settle disputes and
                                enforce security? (2) Is it feasible or desirable to limit UN
                                activities in conformity with the UK view?”</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> called first on
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>. The latter
                            replied that he did not believe that a permanent UN military force was a
                            realistic goal at the present time. He said he had been party to the
                            whole operation in past years which attempted to set up such an
                            organization. He also thought it not practical to earmark specific
                            forces of member nations for UN use. In point of fact, the UN forces in
                            the Middle East were proving effective, but this had been done on an ad
                            hoc basis. If there had been a permanent UN force it would not have
                            worked in the Middle East because it would have been made up of British,
                            French and, indeed, possibly of Soviet contingents. The President said
                            he agreed with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’
                            conclusions, and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>
                            stated that as far as he was concerned it was “simply impossible” at
                            this time to create a permanent UN military organization.</p>
                        <p>As to question 6–b, the President stated that there was really not much
                            use talking about it. The State Department would have to wrestle with
                            each problem in this area as it came up and play the music by ear.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> commented that he
                            was not quite certain of the validity of the statement that the United
                            Kingdom desired to limit UN activities. It was true that not so very
                            long ago the British had been very critical of the fact that the
                            Guatemalan problem had been solved by recourse to the machinery of the
                            Organization of American States. Now, however, they found the shoe on
                            the other foot in the case of Cyprus, and they wished that they had some
                            kind of regional organization, consonant with the UN Charter, which
                            would help them solve such knotty problems as that presented by
                            Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then turned to question
                            7, which he read as follows:</p>
                        <p>“7. Assuming that the United States should maintain its secure
                            retaliatory nuclear capabilities in the absence of a safeguarded
                            disarmament agreement, are there measures in the field of control of
                            armaments which could reduce the likelihood of resort to force? For
                            example:</p>

                            <item>“b. Would the exchange of ground observers lessen the chances of a

                            <pb xml:id="pg_482" n="482" facs="0506"/>
                            <item>“c. Should the United States review its present policy that any
                                agreement on thinning out or withdrawal of opposing forces in Europe

                            <item>“d. Should the United States consider agreements for control of
                                armaments in other areas of tension, e.g., the Middle East?”</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>He explained what lay behind this question in terms of a written brief
                            (copy of which is filed in the minutes of the meeting).<note n="4" xml:id="d117fn4">The written brief is filed in the minutes.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The President said he felt obliged to quarrel with an assumption which
                            underlay question 7 as set forth particularly in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>’s briefing. This, said the
                            President, was the assumption that there would be no security for either
                            the United States or the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> if each
                            of them kept on building up its nuclear capabilities. The President
                            believed that security might result from such a course of action, for
                            the good and sufficient reason that each side would realize the folly of
                            resorting to a course of action in the <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">shape</gloss> of nuclear general war in which each country would be
                            completely destroyed. This was the security of the stalemate.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that what
                            worried him most in this problem area was the probability that unless
                            the United States, the United Kingdom and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> found some safe way to stop the building up of nuclear
                            weapons stockpiles, other countries would presently begin to fabricate
                            nuclear weapons. Such a development would certainly decrease the
                            security of the United States. The President stated his thorough
                            agreement with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’
                            position.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then referred to a
                            recent telegram from Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> which raised much the same question as question
                            7 in a somewhat different context.<note n="5" xml:id="d117fn5">Reference
                                is presumably to telegram 5610 from London, vol. xx, p. 469.</note>
                            Apropos of this, the President said he was greatly interested in the
                            various statements which suggested an apparently greater Soviet interest
                            in disarmament than they had shown in any previous meetings of the
                            Disarmament Subcommittee.</p>
                        <p>At this point Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>
                            intervened to say that the discussion up to this point has been rather
                            in the stratosphere. What the Council really needed to consider was what
                            was to be done about the Defense Department programs for the fiscal
                            years 1959 and beyond. What would be the <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">shape</gloss> of our military programs for the fiscal years 1959,
                            1960 and 1961? At least, continued Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, he was certain that in these years we would
                            require some reduction in our personnel strengths which could be
                            compensated for through the increased fire power of our new weapons. As
                            for fiscal year 1958 expenditures, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he could safely forecast that they would be
                            over $38 billion and perhaps close to $39 billion.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_483" n="483" facs="0507"/>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> added that the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff have been facing some extremely tough problems in
                            trying to think ahead even as far as fiscal year 1960. For example,
                            should we continue to procure B–52 bombers, or should we shift to B–58s,
                            or should we think largely in terms of guided missiles? Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> added his strong
                            feeling that there would have to be a very drastic reduction in the
                            current level of expenditure for continental defense in order to provide
                            and maintain our offensive capabilities. The Joint Chiefs were up
                            against this problem right now because the demands of our continental
                            defense programs were simply skyrocketing.</p>
                        <p>From this subject the Council went into a discussion of the program for
                            providing an atomic-powered aircraft. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that this was a most costly
                            program, although he had succeeded in reducing funds allocated to it
                            from the amount of $500 million a year to $150 million a year. The
                            President expressed astonishment and anger. He did not believe, he said,
                            that the atomic-powered aircraft could be shown to be in any sense a
                            useful military asset. He believed that two or three scientists in a
                            room and a budget of a few thousand dollars was all that should be
                            devoted to this and similar programs. He added the comment that everyone
                            seemed to be “going nuts” on research and development programs.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> indicated that they would
                            confer shortly and present to the President a report and recommendations
                            on the program for the development of an atomic-powered aircraft.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out that
                            although the time was short, he very much wished the Council to look at
                            question 12 on <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/6, which read as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>“12. Can the United States confront the Soviets with choices which,
                            without sacrifice of U.S. security, might offer the Soviets a greater
                            sense of security in return for sacrifices of other Soviet interests
                            (e.g., arms control of [<hi rend="italic">or</hi>] force reductions in
                            return for sacrifice of Russian positions in Germany, Eastern Europe or
                            the Near East)?”</p>
                        <p>In the course of briefing the Council on what lay behind this question (a
                            copy of the briefing note<note n="6" xml:id="d117fn6">The briefing note
                                is filed in the minutes.</note> filed in the minutes of the
                            meeting), Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> referred to
                            the staff study recently completed by the Department of State on the
                            withdrawal of forces from Central Europe. While he noted that this study
                            (a copy of which is likewise filed in the minutes of the meeting)<note n="7" xml:id="d117fn7">The study is filed in the minutes.</note> had
                            reached the conclusion that under existing circumstances and at the
                            present time the United States should not seek an agreement with the
                            Soviet Union by which Soviet forces would be withdrawn into the Soviet
                            Union and U.S. forces withdrawn from Germany, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out that circumstances
                                <pb xml:id="pg_484" n="484" facs="0508"/>might change in the future.
                            It was possible that we should either find ourselves compelled to bring
                            back our forces deployed in Western Europe, or would find it desirable
                            to do so. Accordingly, he would recommend that the Council now authorize
                            a very high-level and fully secret study of this question and our
                            response to it if the circumstances did indeed change.</p>
                        <p>The President replied that his impression of the matter was that the
                            whole thing was in the political stage. It was accordingly up to the
                            State Department to make proposals with respect to the area covered by
                            question 12, rather than for the National Security Council to do so. If
                            the United States once got a military capability in ballistic missiles,
                            we would be just as safe in defending ourselves from the United States
                                [<hi rend="italic">Soviet Union</hi>] alone as we would be in having
                            U.S. forces deployed in Western Europe. In short, our selfish interest
                            in Central Europe was a political rather than a military interest, so
                            that suggestions for the study called for by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> were really for the future.
                            Meanwhile, the State Department should be ready to advise us as to what
                            course of action to follow if any of the matters raised by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>’s briefing note came up for
                            decision.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> pointed out that
                            in connection with the studies which the Joint Chiefs were making as to
                            the <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">shape</gloss> of the Defense Department
                            programs for fiscal years 1959, 1960 and 1961, which he had mentioned
                            earlier, the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> would be examining
                            alternative force structures. They would come up with various choices
                            which the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> would have to discuss and
                            decide; so part of the problems mentioned in paragraph 12 and in Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>’s remarks were already
                            the subject of very urgent study in the Defense Department.</p>
                        <p>The President stated that he had no particular objection to having such
                            matters as were covered in paragraph 12 the subject of study at the
                            present time. He still insisted, however, that the deployment of U.S.
                            divisions in Germany was not justifiable from a political point of
                            view.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> warned that if we
                            proposed in the future to deploy in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> more than three U.S. divisions, such a course of
                            action would require very severe cuts in other Defense Department
                            programs.</p>
                        <p>Moved by Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>’s
                            warning, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>
                            stated that if the United States decided that there are certain things
                            which we had got to do (such as reducing our deployments abroad), we
                            should make these changes in such a way as to derive the maximum
                            advantage from them vis-à-vis the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he was
                            obliged to take issue with this point of view. He did not think it was
                            wise for the United States to alter any strategic position on the
                            assumption that the Russians would actually honor any agreements they
                            made with the United States. Rather, we <pb xml:id="pg_485" n="485" facs="0509"/>should base such changes on our own careful estimate of
                            what was advantageous to ourselves. He said he certainly hoped that the
                            State Department was studying the problem of the future of Germany. We
                            might conceivably be confronted in a year or so with a united and a
                            virtually neutralized Germany. He explained that he thought this might
                            come to pass because of the mounting pressures on the Soviets. It was
                            proving very costly to them to maintain their position in East Germany
                            and in the other satellites. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> added that he did agree with the President that
                            at the present time these problems were primarily political in character
                            and that it was the responsibility of the State Department to keep them
                            under study.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> continued a vigorous
                            argument on behalf of his proposal for a joint study by military and
                            State Department officials with a report to the National Security
                            Council, but he failed to carry his point.</p>
                        <p>There then ensued another brief discussion of concrete problems in the
                            development of Defense Department programs for the coming fiscal years.
                            At the conclusion of this discussion, the President expressed the
                            opinion that we were at the limit of efficient spending in the military
                            field.</p>
                        <p>At the very end of the meeting, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> asked the Council to take one brief look at
                            paragraph 11, which he read as follows:</p>
                        <p>“11. Should the United States in general attempt:</p>
                        <list type="simple">
                            <item>“a. To maintain a high level of tension (through political
                                isolation of the Soviets, propaganda, covert pressures, economic
                                limitations, etc.); or</item>
                            <item>“b. To lower tensions and to negotiate acceptable partial
                                agreements whenever possible?”</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Thereafter he noted that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> has sometimes at Council meetings expressed the
                            view that we should lower tensions and negotiate acceptable agreements
                            with the Soviets when possible, The President said he was certainly
                            opposed to increasing tensions. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> commented that in the State Department we did not
                            think of these things in these terms. We did not recommend measures in
                            the State Department which were consciously designed either to raise
                            tensions or to lower tensions in the world. Certainly we were not trying
                            to lower tensions by pretending that Soviet intrigues were not as bad as
                            we knew they were. Instead, we dealt with each issue on its own
                            intrinsic merits.</p>

                            would also be a cut in the total authorized for the industrial funds.
                            Also, the Congress is estimating Deutsche mark receipts higher than now
                            expected. The other half of the cuts will, however, cut into the
                            program.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said there are several
                            questions that must be considered: whether we would offer any complaint
                            regarding the bookkeeping adjustments; what action we would take where
                            the program cuts really hurt; what response we would make where, in some
                            instances, changes in schedules make it possible to accept the cuts.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> then turned to the rate
                            of expenditures, and said that he is disappointed with actions of the
                            Air Force. They “rode over” the civilian leadership in obtaining
                            additional funds through the Symington hearings last year. Also, their
                            expenditures are rising month by <pb xml:id="pg_487" n="487" facs="0511"/>month, and the Air Force is not trying to help. He said he is thinking
                            of putting a freeze on any new contract commitments other than food and
                            certain other soft goods. He said that the attempt to gain speed in
                            program operation greatly increases costs, which the contractors, who
                            are not operating under a fixed sum bid, simply pass on to the
                            government. The President thought we should shift more of our contracts
                            to competitive, fixed sum bidding. He said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> should go after the Air Force
                            and Navy procurement officials and hold them down. He added that he
                            thinks this performance is a reason supporting the <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> recommendations on budgeting on
                            an annual accrual basis.<note n="4" xml:id="d118fn4">

                            opinion human nature is such that once the funds are authorized the

                            should shift in large measure to a different kind of contract, which
                            would make the manufacturer absorb some of the cost rises and wage
                            increases.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he also wanted to
                            consider cutting overtime on missiles and the B–52. The President said
                            that he felt Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> could
                            tell Congress that the effect of cuts would be to require the
                            elimination of this overtime. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that the Defense expenditures are running
                            about $2 billion over the estimate, and asked whether income is running
                            sufficiently ahead to cover this overage. The President said that it is
                            not, and that he wants every possible action taken to assure that we do
                            not run into the red. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>
                            repeated that he would like to freeze new contract commitments until he
                            is able to get the expenditure rate down, and also see what the Congress
                            does to the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>–58 budget proposal.</p>
                        <p>The President said he thought we should certainly not have overtime on
                            both the B–52 and the ballistic missile projects. He suggested the
                            matter be brought before the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>,
                            indicating how much the overtime is costing us, and recommending
                            priorities as between items. In initial discussion he indicated reasons
                            for stopping overtime on the B–52; in further discussion he indicated
                            that, since the B–52 is a proven weapon, it might be preferable to take
                            the ballistic missiles off overtime. The President indicated agreement
                            to stopping overtime generally, and freezing new contract
                            commitments.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that the question
                            is not only one of specific savings, but to try to establish a new
                            psychology by means of some dramatic actions. The President suggested as
                            a further step the desirability of cutting draft calls in half during
                            the next two months, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he would give further consideration to
                            this.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_488" n="488" facs="0512"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that approximately
                            $7 billion of the annual Defense budget is for direct costs of the
                            forces, and that the forces must be cut prior to the beginning of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>–59. The President suggested starting to
                            cut the force strength now. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that the proposals he had made could affect
                            the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>-58 budget and that there were some
                            bookkeeping actions available to hold down payment prior to the end of
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>–57 but that the remaining time is
                            too short to allow too much of a cut to be made. The President stressed
                            strongly that he wished savings and cuts still to be made in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>–57. The President reiterated the need for
                            something like the <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName>
                            recommendations on accrual budgeting in order to gain control of
                            expenditures.</p>
                        <p>The President and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> then
                            briefly discussed proposals relating to top Defense personnel
                            changes.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> commenced his briefing
                            with a reminder to the Council of the new approach to the revision of
                            basic national security policy. (A copy of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>’s briefing note is filed in the
                            minutes of the meeting.)<note n="3" xml:id="d119fn3">Neither the
                                briefing note nor the minutes has been found in the Eisenhower
                                Library or Department of State files.</note> He suggested that
                            before explaining to the Council the major differences which had
                            developed in the paper on the use of nuclear weapons in local war, he
                            would like to clear up certain less significant points of controversy.
                            Accordingly, he asked the Council to turn to paragraph 12, on page 5 of
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/7, which read as

                            the extent that they will enhance the military effectiveness of the
                            armed forces. The decision as to their use will be made by the
                            President.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>After reading the paragraph and explaining the difference between the
                            majority view and the <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> view, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> to speak to the point.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> said that he did not wish
                            to stand on the inclusion of the bracketed phrase “[produce and]”. He
                            said, however, that he wanted at least to raise the question as to the
                            wisdom of limiting the use of chemical and bacteriological weapons to
                            general war as opposed to limited conflicts.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then asked Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> for his views.
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> replied that the
                            text of paragraph 12 as written, without the bracketed language and
                            without the deletion of the phrase “in general war”, was satisfactory to
                            the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> explained that if a situation developed in which
                            a commander wished to use these weapons in a local conflict, he would
                            apply for authority to order the use of such weapons, and we could make
                            a decision at the time. As far as military planning was concerned, the
                            question was not particularly serious.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he favored
                            leaving paragraph 12 as it was and as Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> had suggested. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> repeated that he was not pressing
                            for the changes proposed by the <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss>
                            Member of the Planning Board. The President said it was all right to
                            leave it as written, because the phrase “be prepared to use” implied at
                            least some production of chemical and bacteriological weapons.
                            Accordingly, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> suggested
                            that the paragraph be left as written in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/7.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> next invited the
                            Council’s attention to another split of views, this time in paragraph
                            49, on page 21, reading as follows:</p>
                        <p>“49. <hi rend="italic">Stockpiling</hi>. The United States should not
                            authorize further procurement for additions to the stockpile for

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> explained that in place
                            of the present paragraph 49, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> had proposed a revision in lieu of his present
                            reservation on this paragraph. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then read Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>’s suggested revision, as follows:</p>
                        <p>“49. <hi rend="italic">Stockpiling</hi>. The United States should not
                            authorize further procurement* for additions to the Strategic Stockpile
                            beyond the 3-year procurement priority levels except in those limited
                            cases where procurement, within the long-term objectives, is necessary
                            to maintain a vital domestic materials mobilization base.</p>
                        <list type="simple">
                            <item>“* This limitation would not apply in those cases where

                                the Defense Production Act or Commodity Credit Corporation
                                programs.”</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Describing Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>’s version as
                            more exact in its terminology, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> called on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> for further elucidation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> emphasized that his
                            proposed new language would not really change the spirit or intent of
                            the first version of paragraph 49— that is, his revised paragraph would
                            still confine new stockpiling procurement to the completion of the
                            3-year objectives. On the other hand, his language would protect the
                            programs that we are now engaged upon with respect to certain materials
                            such as lead, zinc, antimony, etc., pending the development of a
                            Long-Range Minerals Program. <note n="5" xml:id="d119fn5">Regarding the
                                Long-Range Minerals Program, see the editorial note, vol. x, p.
                                689.</note> If the Council accepted the Planning Board language
                            instead of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>’s, the effect
                            would be to put an immediate stop to further procurement of these
                            minerals. Moreover, additional materials might be included next year, in
                            accordance with the exceptions policy directed by the President in 1954.
                            In short, we may feel that it will be necessary to procure some other
                            commodities and materials in order to preserve a vital mobilization
                            base. This was, in summary, the purpose of the changes proposed in his
                            version of paragraph 49.</p>
                        <p>The President recalled that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> had spoken of the possibility of jeweled bearings
                            being stockpiled. Was anybody thinking of taking jeweled bearings out of
                            the stockpile? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> replied
                            that jeweled bearings would be taken out of the stockpile only in the
                            event of an <pb xml:id="pg_491" n="491" facs="0515"/>emergency. The
                            President stated that we already have a 3 year supply of these bearings,
                            and why were we proposing to get any more? Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> replied that the reason we were
                            proposing to get more was the “interest” which certain people had in
                            jeweled bearings. He added that he was sternly opposed to continuing to
                            maintain the 5 year objectives for stockpile levels, and was even
                            somewhat dubious about the 3 year objectives.</p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> asked Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> whether he was still
                            purchasing lead and zinc for purposes of the mobilization base. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> said that he was
                            purchasing lead and zinc in accordance with the President’s directive to
                            support a certain domestic production of these minerals. In point of
                            fact, we had lead and zinc running out of our ears, and we would stop
                            purchasing lead and zinc as soon as the proposed Long-Range Minerals
                            Program was finally adopted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> inquired whether Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> did not feel that his
                            revised language was necessary in order to bring the national
                            stockpiling policy into consonance with the views of Congress. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> replied in the negative,
                            and said that his revised language was designed to take account of the
                            President’s directive of 1954.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said he could
                            perfectly well understand Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>’s argument in favor of trying to ease off procurement
                            of such minerals gradually and not suddenly. Nevertheless, he believed
                            that we really must decide to come to a full stop in procurement of
                            these minerals at some definite date and before three or four more years
                            go by. Essentially we were engaged in procuring lead and zinc in order
                            to avoid raising the tariff on imports of these minerals. If Congress
                            did not adopt the Department of the Interior’s Long-Range Minerals
                            Program, why should we continue this subterfuge of purchasing lead and
                            zinc to avoid raising the tariff on them?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> replied that if this were
                            done he would have to recommend to the President that he change the
                            Executive Order of 1954. If the National Security Council directed the
                            cutting off of further procurement of lead and zinc while the Congress
                            is engaged in considering the Long-Range Minerals Program, we would be
                            facing a very difficult situation. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that he was not suggesting the cutting off
                            of the procurement of lead and zinc prior to the end of the current
                            session of Congress. He was merely arguing against continuing to
                            purchase lead and zinc in the course of future sessions of Congress.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> said that he too disliked
                            the use of stockpiling funds for these purposes, but that he did not see
                            how he could cut off such procurement until the Administration took a
                            different view of the matter. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that we all understood Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>’s position, but when did Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> plan to stop future
                            procurement of these minerals? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> said that of course this was purely a political <pb xml:id="pg_492" n="492" facs="0516"/>problem. He would like very
                            much himself to get off the hook, but the matter was also related to the
                            barter of surplus agricultural commodities for minerals having a
                            strategic value to the United States.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the point was at least arguable. After all, the
                            Council had decided to place these minerals, which did not deteriorate
                            in value, in the stockpile in exchange for certain surplus commodities
                            whose value after a time would deteriorate. He still believed that this
                            policy made good sense.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then suggested that the
                            Council adopt Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>’s proposed
                            language temporarily, until such time as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> could come in with new language and after adoption
                            of the Long-Range Minerals Program. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> commented that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>’s proposal would put Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> in a better position, but
                            would put Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> in a
                            worse position. After all, the Defense Department could establish no
                            security need for this kind of procurement for the stockpile. The
                            President argued that this was not precisely the case. One of our
                            purposes in acquiring these strategic materials from overseas was to
                            help our allies and friendly nations who were in need of help.
                            Accordingly in one sense, at least, this type of procurement was related
                            to national defense.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then suggested further
                            language to meet the points raised in the discussion, and asked
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> to speak.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that he
                            thought Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>’s language was
                            appropriate. The original procurement program adopted by the Council in
                            the interests of national defense and national security had worked well,
                            but it was now on the point of collapsing. Accordingly, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> trusted that we would
                            soon be given the Long-Range Minerals Program. If we failed to get this
                            program, then it would be necessary for the National Security Council to
                            review the entire procurement policy. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> both found difficulties with the language
                            suggested by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>, and
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> suggested
                            language which would continue procurement under Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>’s exception clause, “until
                            mobilization base needs were clarified”. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>, however, took exception to this proposal, and
                            stated that while he agreed firmly that there should be no further
                            additions to the strategic stockpile beyond the 3-year levels, he had
                            nevertheless been informed by staff officials of the Defense Department
                            that it was necessary to take measures to keep jeweled bearings in
                            production in the United States. The President agreed with this point,
                            and added that it was for reasons of national security that we had
                            raised the tariff recently on jeweled bearings.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_493" n="493" facs="0517"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out that in view
                            of the variety of opinion and the length of time which the Council had
                            given to this problem, it might be feasible simply to state that
                            paragraph 49, on stockpiling, would be deleted and the subject brought
                            up for separate consideration at a later time. The President agreed with
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>’s suggestion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> stated that he would now
                            like to have the Council turn to the major area of policy cleavage in
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/7. These cleavages occurred
                            in paragraph 11, 15 and 17. At the same time, he invited the Council’s
                            attention to the sheets which had been passed out to the members of the
                            Council, on which were noted paragraphs 11, 15, 16 and 17 as they were
                            set forth in existing policy (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            5602/1) and as these paragraphs would read in the proposed revisions in
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/ 7. (Copies of these

                            existing and proposed versions of these paragraphs were read by Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> as follows:</p>

                                    is unlikely by itself to result in general nuclear war.
                                    Furthermore, the prompt and resolute application of the degree
                                    of force necessary to defeat local aggression is considered the

                                    Therefore, to oppose local aggression, U.S. forces must have a

                                    force selectively and flexibly will become increasingly
                                    important in maintaining the morale and will of the Free World
                                    to resist aggression. The United States and its allies must
                                    avoid getting themselves in a position where they must choose
                                    between (a) not responding to local aggression and (b) applying
                                    force in a way which our own people or our allies would consider
                                    entails undue risks of nuclear devastation. The apprehensions of
                                    U.S. allies as to using nuclear weapons to counter local
                                    aggression can be lessened if the U.S. deterrent force is not

                                    until the deterrent fails. In the event of actual Communist
                                    local aggression, the United States should, if necessary, make
                                    its own decision as to the use of nuclear weapons. In the last
                                    analysis, when confronted by the choice of (a) acquiescing in
                                    Communist aggression or (b) taking measures risking either
                                    general war or loss of allied support, the United States must be
                                    prepared to take these risks if necessary for its

                            to the objections of the State Member of the Planning Board, the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> Observer believed it premature to
                            authorize giving nuclear weapons to foreign nations or assisting them
                            technically in developing their own, and that he was therefore opposed
                            to modifying existing legislation on this subject.</p>
                        <p>The President turned to Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName> and asked why the Atomic Energy Commission was
                            opposed to changing the existing atomic energy legislation relating to
                            nuclear weapons. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName>
                            replied that the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> objection was based
                            on the belief that the protection of classified information relative to
                            the construction of nuclear weapons was not adequately safeguarded by
                            our allies. If such information became available to the Soviets it would
                            constitute information some of which we do not think the Soviets now
                            have. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName> therefore
                            counselled that our policy should be to keep nuclear warheads under our
                            own U.S. control, although they should be located in close proximity to
                            the weapons in which they would be used in the event of war.</p>
                        <p>Apropos of the suggestion of the Joint Chiefs, the President asked

                            carefully considered the effect on our other allies of a U.S. policy
                            which would restrict the provision of nuclear weapons and warheads to
                            the United Kingdom and Canada alone. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> replied that the Joint Chiefs
                            had considered this matter, but had agreed that from the point of view
                            of U.S. national security the most important course of action was to
                            give such nuclear weapons to Canada for the air defense of the
                            continent, in which the role of Canada was an integral part of the total
                            defense picture. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>
                            admitted that providing these weapons to the United Kingdom would
                            constitute a more difficult problem. [<hi rend="italic">1 sentence (44
                                words) not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>The President then suggested that subparagraph 17–b be rewritten to state
                            in effect that in order to integrate the air defense of the continent,
                            it was essential that Canada be provided with ground-to-air nuclear
                            weapons. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> replied
                            that for that matter the Joint Chiefs of Staff would just as soon drop
                            out the entire subparagraph, since the matter could not now be decided
                            in any event (presumably because of the requirement for a change in the
                            legislation). The President said that this was the way he certainly felt
                            about it. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> and
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> agreed on the
                            desirability of deleting subparagraph 17–b altogether, in view of the
                            existing world situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> asked Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> if he thought deletion of
                            subparagraph 17–b was indeed the best solution, or would it be better to
                            go back to the phraseology on this subject which was contained in <pb xml:id="pg_499" n="499" facs="0523"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602/1, the old policy. On further
                            consideration, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>
                            suggested that perhaps the best solution would be to delete subparagraph
                            17–b and adopt subparagraph 17–a, provided the course of action in
                            subparagraph 17–a could be accomplished now without any change in
                            legislation. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName> and
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> agreed that
                            there was no existing bar to carrying out the course of action set forth
                            in subparagraph 17–a.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then suggested that the
                            Council turn its attention to paragraph 15, which contained the most
                            serious split of views with respect to the use of nuclear weapons in
                            local aggression and related matters. He reminded the Council that the
                            President had requested the Defense Department to draft its views on
                            this subject in the manner which most fully represented the views of the
                            Defense Department. He then called on Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> to speak on this issue.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> stated that he
                            wished to speak rather generally of the new concept formulated by the
                            Defense Department in paragraph 15 and in several other places in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/7. He said he would preface his
                            remarks by saying that he believed he accepted as fully as anyone
                            present, and certainly more fully than any of his State Department
                            colleagues, the inevitability of the general use of nuclear military
                            power as conventional. As new sources of power have been developed
                            historically, there were inevitably great difficulties of adjusting to
                            them; but nevertheless one had in the last analysis to be realistic and
                            to make the adjustment. The real problem, therefore, was the timeliness
                            of the steps proposed by the Defense Department in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/ 7, rather than the ultimate
                            inevitability of treating nuclear weapons as conventional weapons. This,
                            said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, was not
                            the time, in his opinion, to go as far as these paragraphs of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/7 suggested. In the first place,
                            in point of fact the United States does not now possess any nuclear
                            weapons which are really limited in scope and power. Our so-called
                            “little bang weapons” are actually of the type which produced such
                            sensational results at Hiroshima. Thus, whether we have yet reached a
                            point where we could wage a limited war with this kind of nuclear
                            weapons, is very doubtful indeed.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the concept of selectivity simply cannot be disregarded, and
                            the apparent proposal to do so would run counter to public opinion as it
                            has come down through the ages. The time will undoubtedly come when
                            atomic weapons will be so varied and so selective that we can make use
                            of them without involving widespread devastation, but that time is not
                            yet. Thus, whereas the language of paragraphs 15 and 16 of the existing
                            policy (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602/1) had emphasized that
                            we should be prepared to make use of force selectively, the proposed
                            revision of paragraph 15 in the present paper (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/7) merely says that we will use atomic weapons
                            selectively. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            stressed that he did not believe that we were yet ready and prepared to
                                <pb xml:id="pg_500" n="500" facs="0524"/>exercise a selective
                            nuclear capability. If he were wrong, and we already did possess this
                            selective nuclear capability, it was certainly something that the
                            National Security Council should know about.</p>
                        <p>At this point Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName>
                            interrupted, and asked if he could point out that nuclear weapons were
                            now being developed which were approximately 10%, or even 5%, of the
                            size of the weapon used at Nagasaki. Admittedly, however, these small
                            weapons were in comparatively limited quantity at the present time. They
                            were expensive, but the number of them could be increased if this were
                            directed by authority.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> went on to say
                            that if in fact we now do have sufficient nuclear weapons to permit us
                            to use them and at the same time confine the effects to local theatres
                            of operations, it was extremely important that we should know this fact.
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName> indicated that
                            this was a recent development. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> continued, pointing out that even if we do now
                            have this capability (and he had not known it), our allies certainly do
                            not realize that we possess such a capability. Accordingly, we must
                            convince our allies that we have this capability and that these weapons
                            can be used in such a way as to avoid the entire devastation of vast
                            areas. Until we do so, the course of action proposed in the revision of
                            paragraph 15 could be very dangerous indeed. For example, Chancellor
                                <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>
                            <note n="9" xml:id="d119fn9">
                                <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Konrad Adenauer</persName>, Chancellor of
                                the Federal Republic of Germany, was then having talks with U.S.
                                officials in Washington. Documentation on his visit to the United

                            the use of this type of force and this sort of weapon is wrong.
                            Furthermore, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, he well remembered, some fifty years ago this
                            week, the Peace Conference of 1907 at The Hague. This Conference was
                            called to try to control warfare by submarines and balloons, there being
                            no aircraft to control or exclude. The attitude of the German delegation
                            on this occasion made a very deep impression on everybody. It was their
                            view that it was simply not practical to make exceptions of any
                            particular weapon and, indeed, that perhaps the best deterrent to war
                            was to avoid making war more humane. Perhaps the Germans were right in
                            this respect, but their timing was certainly wrong, and a very bad
                            impression was made for Germany.</p>
                        <p>For reasons such as this, the United States could not disregard important
                            elements of world opinion, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he was convinced that world opinion was not
                            yet ready to accept the general use of nuclear weapons in local
                            conflicts. If we resort to such a use of nuclear weapons we will, in the
                            eyes of the world, be cast as a ruthless military power, as was Germany
                            earlier.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> indicated that
                            each of the Assistant Secretaries in the State Department had been asked
                            to give his reaction to this problem.<note n="10" xml:id="d119fn10">The

                            were strongly opposed to the policy on the subject proposed in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/7, because of the disastrous
                            effect of such a policy on public opinion in the areas for which these
                            Assistant Secretaries were responsible. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> predicted that all this would
                            change at some point in the future, but the time had not yet come, even
                            if the United States is beginning to manufacture these smaller nuclear
                            weapons. The State Department people prefer the older concept that
                            “force” would be applied selectively, rather than the new concept that
                            “nuclear weapons” will be applied selectively. Hence Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that it was his view that
                            the policy proposed in paragraph 15 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/7 reflected the wave of the future. As our allies
                            become more and more acquainted with the facts of our selective nuclear
                            capability, this wave of the future will be accepted by them. Meanwhile,
                            the limitations on this issue set forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602/ 1 should be retained in the new basic national
                            security policy paper. To illustrate his point, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> alluded to specific
                            illustrations in paragraphs 15, 16 and 17 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/7.</p>
                        <p>When Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had
                            concluded his general observations, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> suggested that before the Council got down to
                            considering the details of the phrasing of the paper, it should hear
                            from Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> or
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> on the general
                            subject which had just been discussed by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> stated that he
                            personally did not disagree with much that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had said. Perhaps much of the
                            difficulty stemmed from the use to which this paper would be put. It is,
                            of course, not given wide publicity. Nevertheless, in the Free World
                            people do believe that U.S. military planning is along the line set
                            forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/7, and furthermore,
                            said Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>, in his
                            view we really adopted the essentials of this policy as far back as
                            1953. We have gotten a decision from the President, and we are in fact
                            planning essentially along the lines of the military strategy set forth
                            in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/7.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> went on to say
                            that for many years to come our stockpile of atomic weapons will not be
                            so great as to permit any promiscuous use of such weapons. Moreover, for
                            years to come the United States will continue to have very great
                            conventional military capabilities. Nevertheless, we cannot go along
                            with the old language of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602/1 with
                            respect to the military elements of our national <pb xml:id="pg_502" n="502" facs="0526"/>strategy. The language of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602/1 was simply too open and too
                            fuzzed up to be useful for military planning purposes in the Defense
                            Department.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> commented that he
                            was conscious that his own personal point of view was not as different
                            from that of the Secretary of State as might seem to be the case. <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/7 was, after all, a secret policy
                            paper, and one that is looking ahead to the future. After the President
                            had interrupted briefly to express his strong and continued opposition
                            to sending classified <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> papers
                            overseas, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>
                            continued his remarks. He noted that in the area under discussion, our
                            program must be evolutionary rather than revolutionary in character. As
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> had pointed out,
                            the United States still has strong conventional military capabilities.
                            But the other side of the picture was this: The Defense Department was
                            often severely criticized for seeming to develop two or even three
                            different kinds of strategy, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he could not go for this course of action
                            either. There was, after all, no real way of avoiding resort to new
                            military power once such power appears in the world. Accordingly,
                            nuclear power must be developed and exploited, although on an
                            evolutionary basis.</p>
                        <p>Finally, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, he
                            was profoundly troubled about the definitions of limited war. Any kind
                            of war in which U.S. military personnel were involved was very liable to
                            develop into a big war. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> did not think that the United States should fight
                            small wars. It should keep out of them. There should be no more Koreas.
                            Accordingly, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>
                            advised that this matter be clarified in the present paper and not leave
                            the Defense Department to develop two strategies, each one of which cost
                            billions of dollars. He said he would recommend that the Defense
                            Department concept be rewritten to take account of the evolutionary
                            development of the use of nuclear weapons.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> commented that it
                            likewise seemed to him that his own views were not greatly different
                            from those of Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>
                            and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>. But the
                            evolutionary process of which Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> had spoken must be timed both with relation to
                            the techniques of the art of war and with the development of public
                            opinion. He said that he felt a great sympathy for and an acceptance of
                            the views of the Defense Department, but he did not want the United
                            States to get out of step with world opinion.</p>
                        <p>The President stated that he had talked over these problems with Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> prior to the meeting.
                            At this time the President said that he himself had proposed a new
                            sentence as an introduction to the second paragraph of paragraph 15 of
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/7, which the President read
                            as follows: “local aggression as used in this paragraph refers only to
                            conflicts occurring in less developed areas of the world, in which <pb xml:id="pg_503" n="503" facs="0527"/>limited U.S. forces participate
                            because U.S. interests are involved.” The President said that he had
                            also a substitute for the last sentences in the second paragraph of
                            paragraph 15, which he thought might meet the points which had been
                            raised in the Council discussion thus far. The President read these
                            sentences as follows: “Therefore, military planning for U.S. forces to
                            oppose local aggression will be based on the development of a flexible
                            and selective capability, including nuclear capability for use as
                            authorized by the President. When the use of U.S. forces is required to
                            oppose local aggression, force will be applied in a manner and on a
                            scale best calculated to avoid hostilities from broadening into general
                            war.”</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> first referred to
                            earlier discussions on measures required to protect Taiwan from Chinese
                            Communist aggression and the need to use nuclear weapons in its defense.
                            He added that what the President had suggested seemed to him exactly
                            what we needed by way of revision. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> agreed with Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>, and reread paragraph 15 in its entirety as
                            amended by the President. In explanation of his amendments, the
                            President pointed out that military action in Berlin could not be kept
                            local in character; nor, probably, could military action in the Near
                            East. Limited wars could really only be limited in underdeveloped
                            areas.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then stated his
                            objection to the statement in paragraph 15 that “The use of nuclear
                            weapons in limited war is unlikely by itself to result in general
                            nuclear war.” The President added that with respect to his inclusion of
                            language in the last sentences of paragraph 15 to indicate the
                            development of a flexible and selected capability for <hi rend="italic">use as authorized by the President</hi>, this qualification was not
                            likely to impose any problems, because in the contingency of limited war
                            as opposed to general war, it would not be difficult, in a timely
                            manner, to get the President’s authorization for the use of nuclear
                            weapons.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> suggested that if the
                            language proposed by the President was agreeable, the Council look at
                            paragraph 11, with particular reference to what he understood to be the
                            views of the Secretary of State. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he would prefer the phraseology “and to use
                            them when required to achieve <hi rend="italic">national</hi>
                            objectives” rather than the phraseology “when required to achieve <hi rend="italic">military</hi> objectives.” The President and other
                            members of the Council agreed with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ preference.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then invited the
                            Council’s attention to paragraph 17-a, and the Secretary of State
                            indicated that he did not like the phraseology “The United States and
                            its allies <hi rend="italic">must</hi> accept nuclear weapons as an
                            integral part of the arsenal of the Free World, etc., etc.”. The
                            President asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            whether he meant that in effect we, the United States, accept nuclear
                            weapons as an integral part of our <pb xml:id="pg_504" n="504" facs="0528"/>arsenal, and we are trying to educate our allies to the
                            same acceptance. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            said that the President was right, and that we were furthermore making
                            considerable progress in getting our allies to accept this concept.
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> noted that as
                            far back as 1953 the State Department had been charged in our basic
                            national security policy paper with the effort to convince our allies
                            that nuclear weapons should be an integral part of the Free World’s
                            arsenal. He added that the State Department had done very well in
                            carrying out this task. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>
                            suggested that in place of the word “must”, we should insert the phrase
                            “should continue to persuade”. The Council accepted Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>’s amendment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then asked Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> whether he believed it
                            desirable, as was suggested in the State Department annex to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/7, that there should be a further
                            study by an informed and disinterested group of the problem of the
                            limited use of force or hypothetical studies of limited war. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied in the
                            negative, as did the President and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>, both with emphasis. The President, however,
                            added that he would like to have Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName> come in with a report and a diagram delineating
                            nuclear weapons available to the United States, from the 10-megaton
                            weapon all the way down to the smallest size of nuclear weapon, as
                            encompassed in our present programs. This should include the percentages
                            of the different categories of weapons.<note n="11" xml:id="d119fn11">For a summary of <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName>’
                                report, see <ref target="#d121">Document 121</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> turned to the
                            President and said he had just one observation to make. Let us be sure
                            that we are clear, and that the language we choose is clear, as to the
                            kind of program we are planning—the program for military planning of
                            weapons, not the program for diplomacy. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> warned that if we did not
                            tailor our military planning and our military expenditures to nuclear
                            capabilities, the result would cost an awful lot of money. No
                            misunderstanding can be permitted that we are engaged in developing and
                            continuing two distinct military capabilities and two different military
                            strategies. The President commented that there just must be good sense
                            and good judgment in this matter. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> strongly supported the point made by Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Although Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> was
                            obliged to leave the meeting at this point to keep his engagement with
                            Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> asked the President’s permission
                            to call attention to a number of other paragraphs in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/7 which had been agreed to in the
                            Planning Board but which, nevertheless, marked a significant change of
                            emphasis over the equivalent paragraphs in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5602/1. In the course of pointing out these agreed
                            paragraphs, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> came to
                            paragraph 19, reading as follows:</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_505" n="505" facs="0529"/>
                        <p>“19. In those countries with which the United States does not have mutual
                            security agreements, the United States should, where appropriate, avoid
                            the provision of grant assistance as a means of compensation for base
                            rights.”</p>
                        <p>With respect to this paragraph, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he believed that it should be deleted in its
                            entirety. The United States should decide only on an ad hoc basis what
                            it should do by way of compensation for base rights. Moreover, it was
                            inopportune to agree to the policy set forth in paragraph 19 at the very
                            time that former Assistant Secretary of Defense Nash was engaged in a
                            review of U.S. base problems world-wide.<note n="12" xml:id="d119fn12">Regarding Nash’s study, see <ref target="#d83fn2">footnote 2,

                                172</ref>.</note> Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> strongly supported Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s views. The President commented
                            that in place of paragraph 19 he would prefer to put in language
                            suggesting that we should look at our overseas bases with a very
                            jaundiced eye, to see if in point of fact we needed them all
                            (laughter).</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> suggested elimination of
                            paragraph 19, and this met with general agreement.</p>

                            reliance on nuclear weapons; to integrate nuclear weapons with other
                            weapons in the arsenal of the United States; to consider them as
                            conventional weapons from a military point of view; and to use them when
                            required to achieve national objectives. Advance authorization for their
                            use is as determined by the President.”</p>

                            follows:</p>
                        <p>“15. Within the total U.S. military forces there must be included ready
                            forces which, with such help as may realistically be expected from
                            allied forces, are adequate (a) to present a deterrent to any resort to
                            local aggression, and (b) to defeat or <pb xml:id="pg_506" n="506" facs="0530"/>hold, in conjunction with indigenous forces, any such
                            local aggression, pending the application of such additional U.S. and
                            allied power as may be required to suppress quickly the local
                            aggression. Such ready forces must be highly mobile and suitably
                            deployed, recognizing that some degree of maldeployment from the
                            viewpoint of general war must be accepted.</p>
                        <p>“Local aggression as used in this paragraph 15 refers only to conflicts
                            occurring in less developed areas of the world, in which limited U.S.
                            forces participate because U.S. interests are involved. The prompt and
                            resolute application of the degree of force necessary to defeat local
                            aggression is considered the best means to keep hostilities from
                            broadening into general war. Therefore, military planning for U.S.
                            forces to oppose local aggression will be based on the development of an
                            appropriate flexible and selective capability, including nuclear
                            capability for use as authorized by the President. When the use of U.S.
                            forces is required to oppose local aggression, force will be applied in
                            a manner and on a scale best calculated to avoid hostilities from
                            broadening into general war.”</p>

                            follows:</p>
                        <p>“17. The United States should continue efforts to persuade its allies to
                            recognize nuclear weapons as an integral part of the arsenal of the Free
                            World and the need for their prompt and selective use when required.
                            Taking into account the protection of classified data, the essential
                            requirements of U.S. forces, production capabilities, and the likely
                            availability of funds, the United States should continue to provide to
                            allies capable of using them effectively advanced weapons systems
                            (including nuclear weapons systems less nuclear elements).”</p>

                        <p rend="center">Preamble</p>
                        <p>1. The spiritual, moral and material posture of the United States of
                            America rests upon established principles which have been asserted and
                            defended throughout the history of the Republic. The genius, strength
                            and promise of America are founded in the dedication of its people and

                            God. These concepts and our institutions which nourish and maintain them
                            with justice are the bulwark of our free society, and are the basis of
                            the respect and leadership which have been accorded our nation by the
                            peoples of the world. When they are challenged, our response must be
                            resolute and worthy of our heritage. From this premise must derive our
                            national will and the policies which express it. The continuing full
                            exercise of our individual and collective responsibilities is required
                            to realize the basic objective of our national security policies:
                            maintaining the security of the United States and the vitality of its
                            fundamental values and institutions.</p>

                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">The basic purpose</hi> of U.S. national strategy is
                            to cope with these interrelated factors, without seriously weakening the
                            U.S. economy, so as to minimize the threat to U.S. security and to
                            create and maintain an international environment in which the United
                            States can sustain its fundamental values and institutions.</p>
                        <p>5. The United States and its allies have no foreseeable prospect of
                            stopping the growth of Soviet nuclear capabilities and of reducing
                            Soviet armed strength—the core of Communist power—or of significantly
                            reducing other basic Communist military strength, except by mutually
                            acceptable agreements with the Soviets or by large-scale <pb xml:id="pg_510" n="510" facs="0534"/>military action. The initiation
                            by the United States of such military action for this purpose is not an
                            acceptable course either to the United States or its major allies.</p>
                        <p>6. Hence, U.S. policies must be designed (a) to affect the conduct and
                            policies of the Communist regimes, especially those of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, in ways that further U.S. security
                            interests (including safeguarded disarmament); and (b) to foster
                            tendencies that lead them to abandon expansionist policies. In pursuing
                            this general strategy, our effort should be directed to:</p>
                        <p>a. Deterring further Communist aggression, and preventing the occurrence
                            of total war so far as compatible with U.S. security.</p>
                        <p>b. Maintaining and developing in the Free World the mutuality of interest
                            and common purpose, the confidence in the United States, and the will,
                            strength and stability necessary to face the Soviet-Communist threat and
                            to provide constructive and attractive alternatives to Communism, which
                            sustain the hope and confidence of the free peoples.</p>
                        <p>c. In addition to a and b above, taking other actions designed to foster
                            changes in the character and policies of the Soviet-Communist bloc
                            regimes:</p>
                        <list type="ordered">

                                those alternative lines of action which, while in their national
                                interests, do not conflict with the security interests of the United
                                States.</item>
                            <item>(2) By exploiting differences between such regimes to disrupt the
                                structure of the Soviet-Communist bloc.</item>
                            <item>(3) By exploiting vulnerabilities within the bloc countries in
                                ways consistent with this general strategy.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>d. Destroying or neutralizing the international Communist apparatus in
                            the Free World.</p>
                        <p>7. To carry out effectively this general strategy will require a flexible
                            combination of military, political, economic, psychological, and covert
                            actions which enables the full exercise of U.S. initiative. These
                            actions must be so coordinated as to reinforce one another.</p>
                        <p>8. Provided that it is resolutely pursued, this general strategy offers
                            the best hope of bringing about at least a prolonged period of armed
                            truce, and ultimately a peaceful resolution of the Soviet bloc-Free
                            World conflict and a peaceful and orderly world environment. Failure
                            resolutely to pursue this general strategy could, within a relatively
                            short span of years, place the United States in great jeopardy.</p>

                        <p rend="center">Section B</p>
                        <p rend="center">Elements of National Strategy</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. Military Elements of National Strategy</p>
                        <p>9. A central aim of U.S. policy must be to deter the Communists from use
                            of their military power, remaining prepared to fight general war should
                            one be forced upon the United States. This stress on deterrence is
                            dictated by the disastrous character of total nuclear war, the
                            possibility of local conflicts developing into total war, and the
                            serious effect of further Communist aggression. Hence the Communist
                            rulers must be convinced that aggression will not serve their interests:
                            that it will not pay.</p>
                        <p>10. If this purpose is to be achieved, the United States and its allies
                            in the aggregate will have to have, for an indefinite period, military
                            forces with sufficient strength, flexibility and mobility to enable them
                            to deal swiftly and severely with Communist overt aggression in its
                            various forms and to cope successfully with general war should it
                            develop. In addition, the deterrent is much more likely to be effective
                            if the United States and its major allies show that they are united in
                            their determination to use military force against such aggression.</p>
                        <p>11. It is the policy of the United States to place main, but not sole,
                            reliance on nuclear weapons; to integrate nuclear weapons with other
                            weapons in the arsenal of the United States; to consider them as
                            conventional weapons from a military point of view; and to use them when
                            required to achieve national objectives. Advance authorization for their
                            use is as determined by the President.</p>
                        <p>12. The United States will be prepared to use chemical and
                            bacteriological weapons in general war to the extent that they will
                            enhance the military effectiveness of the armed forces. The decision as
                            to their use will be made by the President.</p>
                        <p>13. If time permits and an attack on the United States or U.S. forces is
                            not involved, the United States should consult appropriate allies before
                            any decision to use nuclear chemical or bacteriological weapons is made
                            by the President.</p>
                        <p>14. In carrying out the central aim of deterring general war, the United
                            States must develop and maintain as part of its military forces its
                            effective nuclear retaliatory power, and must keep that power secure
                            from neutralization or from a Soviet knockout blow, even by surprise.
                            The United States must also develop and maintain adequate military and
                            non-military programs for continental defense. So long as the Soviets
                            are uncertain of their ability to neutralize the U.S. nuclear
                            retaliatory power, there is little reason to expect them deliberately to
                                <pb xml:id="pg_512" n="512" facs="0536"/>initiate general war or
                            action which they believe would carry appreciable risk of general war,
                            and thereby endanger the regime and the security of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>15. Within the total U.S. military forces there must be included ready
                            forces which, with such help as may realistically be expected from
                            allied forces, are adequate (a) to present a deterrent to any resort to
                            local aggression, and (b) to defeat or hold, in conjunction with
                            indigenous forces, any such local aggression, pending the application of
                            such additional U.S. and allied power as may be required to suppress
                            quickly the local aggression. Such ready forces must be highly mobile
                            and suitably deployed, recognizing that some degree of maldeployment
                            from the viewpoint of general war must be accepted.</p>
                        <p>Local aggression as used in this paragraph refers only to conflicts
                            occurring in less developed areas of the world, in which limited U.S.
                            forces participate because U.S. interests are involved. The prompt and
                            resolute application of the degree of force necessary to defeat such
                            local aggression is considered the best means to keep hostilities from
                            broadening into general war. Therefore, military planning for U.S.
                            forces to oppose local aggression will be based on the development of a
                            flexible and selective capability, including nuclear capability for use
                            as authorized by the President. When the use of U.S. forces is required
                            to oppose local aggression, force will be applied in a manner and on a
                            scale best calculated to avoid hostilities from broadening into general
                            war.</p>
                        <p>16. U.S. security is predicated upon the support and cooperation of
                            appropriate major allies and certain other Free World countries, in
                            providing their share of military forces and in furnishing bases for
                            U.S. military power (although U.S. dependence on such bases is likely to
                            diminish over the long run). The United States should take the necessary
                            steps to convince its <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and other
                            allies that U.S. strategy and policy serve their security as well as its
                            own, and that, while their full contribution and participation must be
                            forthcoming, the United States is committed to their defense and
                            possesses the capability to fulfill that commitment. The United States
                            should strengthen as practicable the collective defense system and
                            utilize, where appropriate, the possibilities of collective action
                            through the UN.</p>
                        <p>17. The United States should continue efforts to persuade its allies to
                            recognize nuclear weapons as an integral part of the arsenal of the Free
                            World and the need for their prompt and selective use when required.
                            Taking into account the protection of classified data, the essential
                            requirements of U.S. forces, production capabilities, and the likely
                            availability of funds, the United States should continue to provide to
                            allies capable of using them effectively advanced weapons systems
                            (including nuclear weapons systems less nuclear elements).</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_513" n="513" facs="0537"/>
                        <p>18. The United States should continue to provide military and support
                            assistance to dependable allied nations were such assistance is
                            necessary to enable them to make their appropriate contributions to
                            collective military power. To the extent possible without sacrifice of
                            U.S. security, the United States should seek to reduce requirements for
                            military assistance by encouraging selected recipient countries
                            (principally non-European) (1) to reduce large indigenous forces
                            maintained to resist external aggression to a size commensurate with
                            both the economic ability of the allied country to support and with the
                            external threat, placing reliance for additional support on U.S.
                            capabilities, and (2) to emphasize police-type forces for internal
                            security purposes in lieu of large indigenous military
                            establishments.</p>
                        <p>19. The United States and its allies must reject the concept of
                            preventive war or acts intended to provoke war. Hence, the United States
                            should attempt to make clear, by word and conduct, that it is not our
                            intention to provoke war. At the same time the United States and its
                            major allies must make clear their determination to oppose aggression
                            despite risk of general war; and the United States must make clear its
                            determination to prevail if general war eventuates.</p>
                        <p>20. Dynamic research and development for military application are a
                            necessity for the continued maintenance of an adequate U.S. military
                            posture and effective armed forces. Without increasing effectiveness in
                            the research and development field, U.S. weaponry may in the future fall
                            qualitatively behind that of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>,
                            with concomitant danger to U.S. security. U.S. research and development
                            must be carried out with full recognition of this potential danger.
                            Moreover, the United States must speed up, by all practicable steps, the
                            means whereby important scientific discoveries can be translated into an
                            appropriate flow of new weapons to the armed forces.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Political and Economic Strategy</p>
                        <p>21. Political and economic progress in the Free World is vitally
                            important (a) to maintain the effectiveness of the military deterrent by
                            preserving the cohesion of our alliances and the political basis for
                            allied facilities and capabilities; (b) as an end in itself, in
                            strengthening the vitality and well-being of the free nations; and (c)
                            to create the conditions which over time will be conducive to acceptable
                            change in the Communist bloc. Behind the shield of its deterrent system,
                            the United States should place relatively more stress on promoting
                            growth and development in the Free World and constructive evolution in
                            the Communist bloc.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_514" n="514" facs="0538"/>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">A. Strengthening the Free World</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>22. The United States should take adequate actions for the purpose of (a)
                            creating cohesion within and among all the free nations, remedying their
                            weaknesses, and steadily improving the relative position of the Free
                            World; (b) destroying the effectiveness of the Communist apparatus in
                            the Free World; and (c) combatting the effects of Soviet bloc diplomatic
                            and economic activities in the Free World. Success in these endeavors
                            will depend heavily on the degree to which the United States and its
                            major allies can attain agreement on objectives and actions to achieve
                            them, consistent with basic U.S. objectives.</p>
                        <p>23. In the face of divisions, fears, and weaknesses, which in many cases
                            the Communists can exploit, the United States must choose between (a)
                            taking timely action to help remedy such conditions, or (b) allowing the
                            situation to deteriorate with the prospect of later trying to prevent
                            Communist gains by more costly and less certain measures, or even
                            military action. The ability of the Free World, over the long pull, to
                            meet the challenge and competition of the Communist world will depend in
                            large measure on the capacity to demonstrate progress toward meeting the
                            basic needs and aspirations of its peoples.</p>
                        <p>24. Two of the basic problems in the economic field are: (a)
                            industrialized areas require further economic growth and expanded trade;
                            and (b) the less developed areas seek to develop and modernize their
                            economies and must also maintain a substantial volume of exports of
                            primary products. It should be within the capacity of the Free World,
                            with U.S. initiative and leadership, to turn these two problems into
                            mutually supporting assets for the promotion of appropriate economic
                            strength and growth.</p>
                        <p>25. A necessary condition for such strength and growth is a high level of
                            international trade within the Free World. In order to foster this, the
                            United States should (a) continue to press strongly for a general
                            reduction of barriers to such trade; (b) take the lead by reducing
                            further its own tariffs and other trade restrictions over the next few
                            years, with due regard to national security and total national
                            advantage; and (c) also support sound moves to widen the convertibility
                            of currencies.</p>
                        <p>26. a. The United States should encourage and support movements toward
                            European unity, especially those leading to supra-national institutions,
                            bearing in mind that the basic initiative must come from the Europeans
                            themselves. The United States should continue the policy of providing
                            financial and other assistance to promote such integration.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_515" n="515" facs="0539"/>
                        <p>b. The United States should encourage and assist the development of the
                            sounder relationship between Europe and Africa which is now
                            emerging.</p>
                        <p>c. The United States may find it expedient to continue economic
                            assistance to certain European countries, such as Spain, Yugoslavia and
                            Turkey, to assist them in achieving stability and growth while
                            maintaining necessary military forces.</p>
                        <p>27. a. Dangers to Free World stability are particularly acute in the less
                            developed areas. The United States should support and foster economic
                            growth in these areas in order to increase political stability and Free
                            World cohesion. The task of speeding up economic growth and promoting
                            stability presents a multitude of political, social, and economic
                            problems, and calls for some changes in traditional habits and attitudes
                            and for greatly expanded training in administrative and technical
                            skills.</p>
                        <p>b. New capital investment is a prerequisite to growth. Utilization of
                            private investment should be encouraged to the maximum feasible extent.
                            Local capital will have to be supplemented by the provision of capital
                            from abroad. In addition to external public and private investment and
                            IBRD loans, the United States must be prepared to continue an economic
                            development assistance program on a substantial and long-term basis, to
                            help achieve the economic progress essential to U.S. interests.</p>
                        <p>28. a. U.S. foreign economic programs should be designed to:</p>
                        <p>(1) Promote conditions of sound development in less developed nations in
                            order to retain and strengthen them as members of the Free World.</p>
                        <p>(2) Demonstrate to those nations that they can progress economically
                            without becoming dependent upon the soviet bloc or endangering their
                            independence.</p>
                        <p>(3) Recognizing that it is not U.S. policy to endeavor in each instance
                            to match Soviet offers, counter so far as practicable the apparent
                            attractiveness and damaging effects of the Soviet bloc economic
                            offensive.</p>
                        <p>b. The United States should be prepared to use economic means available
                            to it to promote conditions of sound development in less developed
                            nations where:</p>
                        <p>(1) The political and economic situation is important to the security of
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>(2) Such development cannot be financed by local capital or other
                            non-Communist foreign assistance.</p>
                        <p>(3) Such assistance will be effectively used and recipient governments
                            are willing to take appropriate measures, when necessary, toward that
                            end.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_516" n="516" facs="0540"/>
                        <p>c. The total level of U.S. economic assistance worldwide should be
                            consistent with the objectives we seek to achieve in the world, such as
                            peace, the security and economic vitality of the United States, the
                            independence of the new states, long-range security interests, and the
                            development of future markets. Increases in economic development
                            assistance should, to the extent politically and militarily feasible, be
                            offset by decreases in other economic or in military assistance
                            programs.</p>
                        <p>d. In order to make the most effective use of economic aid resources and
                            to facilitate planning of longer-term projects and programs necessary
                            for economic development, the Executive Branch should obtain authority
                            for a fund to make loans for economic development repayable whenever
                            necessary in local currencies.</p>
                        <p>29. U.S. financial assistance alone cannot produce satisfactory economic
                            growth in less developed areas. External assistance should be used in a
                            way to promote local self-help, incentives, and initiative in mobilizing
                            local resources and developing sound programs. In addition to the
                            provision of financial assistance, the United States should devote more
                            effort (by training programs, aid to local institutions, and providing
                            competent advisers) to the development of local leaders, administrators,
                            and skilled personnel, recognizing that such people are essential for
                            using and managing other resources effectively.</p>
                        <p>30. U.S. political policies must be adapted to conditions prevailing in
                            each less developed area. The United States should not exert pressure to
                            make active allies of countries not so inclined, but should recognize
                            that the independence of such countries from Communism serves U.S.
                            interests even though they are not aligned with the United States. The
                            United States should provide assistance on the basis of the will and
                            ability of such countries to defend and strengthen their independence,
                            and should take other feasible steps which will strengthen their
                            capacity to do so.</p>
                        <p>31. The United States cannot afford the loss to Communist extremism of
                            constructive nationalist and reform movements in colonial areas in Asia
                            and Africa. The United States should seek (a) to work with, rather than
                            against, such forces when convinced they are likely to remain powerful
                            and grow in influence; and (b) to prevent the capture of such forces by
                            Communism. Where disputes or tensions involve the relations of a major
                            U.S. ally with a colonial or dependent area, the United States should
                            use its influence in behalf of an orderly evolution of political
                            arrangements toward self-determination, and should seek to strengthen
                            the forces of moderation in both the colonial and metropolitan
                            areas.</p>
                        <p>32. The United States should continue its full support of and active
                            leadership in the United Nations and specialized agencies, and should
                            seek to make maximum use of the UN for the settlement of <pb xml:id="pg_517" n="517" facs="0541"/>international disputes and as
                            an instrument of collective security. The UN forum, moreover, can serve
                            and should be used as an effective means to mobilize Free World opinion
                            in support of U.S. policies, to expose Soviet propaganda and activities,
                            and to exploit the vulnerabilities of Soviet management of the satellite
                            empire.</p>
                        <p>33. The United States should actively continue to carry out its programs
                            for the peaceful uses of atomic energy in order to maintain U.S.
                            leadership and initiative in this field.</p>
                        <p>34. In countries vulnerable to subversion, the United States should, as
                            one of its objectives, assist in the development of adequate local
                            internal security forces, recognizing that direct action against the
                            Communist apparatus must rest largely with the local government
                            concerned. The United States should:</p>
                        <p>a. Seek to alert vulnerable countries to the methods and dangers of
                            Communist subversion.</p>
                        <p>b. [<hi rend="italic">remainder of paragraph (15 words) not
                                declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>c. [<hi rend="italic">remainder of paragraph (14 words) not
                                declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>d. In the event of an imminent or actual Communist seizure of control,
                            take all feasible measures to thwart it, including military action if
                            required and appropriate to cope with the situation.</p>
                        <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Means of Directly Influencing the Communist
                                Bloc</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>35. a. The primary means for influencing Soviet conduct must be adequate
                            political, military, and economic programs and actions. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Communist China cannot be
                            expected to revise their methods of operation or their practical goals
                            more conformably to U.S. interest unless further Communist expansion is
                            prevented, present Communist techniques of pressure and inducement are
                            effectively countered, and the relative position of the Free World is
                            manifestly improved.</p>
                        <p>b. The Free World has in addition such specific means of influencing
                            Soviet conduct as East-West relations, the negotiating process, and the
                            exploitation of Soviet bloc vulnerabilities. U.S. policies on each of
                            these subjects should be designed to achieve a consistent effect, and
                            should be carried out so as to be compatible with basic national
                            security strategy and so as not to weaken the will to resist Communism
                            in the Free World.</p>
                        <p>36. In utilizing East-West relations, negotiations and exploitation of
                            vulnerabilities to influence Soviet conduct, the United States should
                            seek (a) to reduce the likelihood or capability of Soviet aggression or
                            subversive expansion; (b) to give to the Communist regimes a clear
                            conception of the true U.S. and Free World purposes, including
                            uncompromising U.S. determination to resist Communist aggressive moves
                            and uphold freedom; (c) to convince the Communist leaders that
                            alternatives exist to their present policies which would be acceptable
                                <pb xml:id="pg_518" n="518" facs="0542"/>to the United States and
                            which they might come to consider compatible with their own security
                            interests; (d) to correct the distorted image of the West which has been
                            sedulously cultivated for years inside the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>; (e) to encourage the Communist regimes to take
                            measures which would make more difficult a reversal of peaceful policy
                            and which might over the long run lead to basic changes in the outlook
                            or character of Communist regimes; (f) to expose the true nature of
                            Communist imperialism.</p>
                        <p>37. In East-West relations the United States should continue to sponsor
                            proposals for a selective expansion of Free World-Communist bloc
                            contacts, which are chosen with a view to:</p>
                        <p>a. Maintaining Free World initiative and leadership for genuinely
                            reciprocal reductions of the barriers to free communications and
                            peaceful trade;</p>
                        <p>b. Increasing the acquisition of useful intelligence concerning the
                            Communist bloc; and</p>
                        <p>c. Avoiding a net disadvantage to the United States from such
                            contacts;</p>
                        <p>and which, if accepted, would favor evolution in the Soviet society and
                            economy toward peaceful development, or, if rejected, would expose the
                            persistence of expansionism behind the facade of Soviet tactics and
                            propaganda. In considering proposals for such Free World-Communist bloc
                            contacts, the United States should take account of the effect of the
                            U.S. example upon other free nations more vulnerable to Communist
                            penetration.</p>
                        <p>38. The United States should continue its readiness to negotiate with the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> whenever it appears that U.S.
                            security interests will be served thereby. Such negotiations have
                            additional importance in maintaining Free World initiative and cohesion,
                            and are desirable in order to probe the intentions and expose the
                            meaning of Soviet policies. The United States and its major allies
                            should be prepared to sponsor genuinely reciprocal concessions between
                            the Free World and the Communist bloc which would leave unimpaired the
                            net security position of the Free World and which would contribute to
                            the ultimate peaceful resolution of the Communist threat. The United
                            States should not, however, make concessions in advance of similar
                            action by the Soviets, in the hope of inspiring Soviet concessions.
                            Until the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> evidences a modification
                            of its basic hostility toward the non-Communist world through concrete
                            actions, agreements should be dependent upon a balance of advantages to
                            the non-Communist world and not upon implied good will or trust in
                            written agreements.</p>
                        <p>39. The United States in its own interest should, as interrelated parts
                            of its national policy, actively seek a comprehensive, phased and
                            safeguarded international system for the regulation and reduction of <pb xml:id="pg_519" n="519" facs="0543"/>armed forces and armaments;
                            concurrently, in related, parallel steps, make intensive efforts to
                            resolve other major international issues; and meanwhile continue the
                            steady development of strength in the United States and in the Free
                            World coalition required for U.S. security. As the initial step in this
                            international arms system, the United States should give priority to
                            early agreement on and implementation of (a) such confidence-building
                            measures as the exchange of military blueprints, mutual aerial
                            inspection and establishment of ground control posts at strategic
                            centers; (b) all such measures of adequately safeguarded disarmament as
                            are now feasible; and (c) measures likely to forestall nations not now
                            possessing nuclear weapons from developing a capability to produce them.
                            The acceptability and character of any international system for the
                            regulation and reduction of armed forces and armaments depend primarily
                            on the scope and effectiveness of the safeguards against violations and
                            evasions, and especially the inspection system.</p>
                        <p>40. In the exploitation of Soviet bloc vulnerabilities, the United States
                            should design its policies and programs (a) to promote evolutionary
                            changes in Soviet policies and conduct in ways that further U.S. and
                            Free World security; (b) to weaken the ties which link the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Communist China and bind their
                            satellites; (c) to encourage bureaucratic and popular pressures inside
                            the bloc for greater emphasis by the regimes on their internal problems,
                            and on national interests in the satellites; and (d) to undermine the
                            faith of the Communist ruling classes in their own system and ideology.
                            The effort should be to pose for them the necessity of devoting
                            attention and resources to these needs or facing increased disaffection
                            with the regime or the satellite relationship if these needs are
                            ignored. When feasible, the Executive Branch should seek changes in
                            legislation relaxing present restrictions on the use of economic aid to
                            foster the development of independence among the Eastern European
                            satellites.</p>
                        <p>41. In applying this strategy to Communist China the United States must
                            take account of non-recognition of the regime, the hostility of the
                            regime, its aggressive policy, and the undesirability of enhancing the
                            power and influence of Communist China relative to free Asian nations.
                            Moreover, the United States should not overlook any possibility, however
                            remote, of fostering among the Chinese people demands for an alternative
                            to the Communist regime. However, the United States should continue its
                            willingness to participate in talks with, or including, Communist China
                            on specific subjects on an ad hoc basis where the general objectives of
                            its political strategy against the Communist bloc would be served
                            thereby.</p>

                        <p>a. A strong, healthy and expanding U.S. economy is essential to the
                            security and stability of the Free World. The level of expenditures for
                            national security programs must take into full account the danger to the
                            United States and its allies resulting from impairment, through
                            inflation or the undermining of incentives, of the basic soundness of
                            the U.S. economy or of the continuing expansion of the U.S. economy
                            under a free enterprise system.</p>
                        <p>b. The Federal Government should maintain overall credit and fiscal
                            policies designed to assist in stabilizing the economy and make a
                            determined effort to keep its expenditures below its anticipated
                            revenues by an amount sufficient to permit some reduction in the public
                            debt and from time to time to provide for tax reductions; recognizing
                            that the United States must continue to meet the necessary costs of the
                            programs essential for its security.<note n="6" xml:id="d120fn6">Except

                        <p>c. All Federal expenditures, especially those not essential for the
                            national security, should be held to a necessary minimum. Every effort
                            should be made to eliminate waste, duplication, and unnecessary overhead
                            in the Federal Government.</p>
                        <p>d. The United States should also seek (1) to maintain a higher and
                            expanding rate of economic activity at relatively stable price levels,
                            and (2) to maximize the economic potential of private enterprise by
                            minimizing governmental controls and regulations and by encouraging
                            private enterprise to develop natural and technological resources (e.g.
                            nuclear power).</p>
                        <p>44. <hi rend="italic">Internal Security</hi>. Internal security measures
                            should be made adequate, by strengthening them as necessary, to meet the
                            threat to U.S. security of covert attack by the Soviet bloc on the
                            United States by means of sabotage, subversion, espionage and,
                            particularly, the clandestine introduction and detonation of nuclear
                            weapons.</p>
                        <p>45. <hi rend="italic">Civil Defense</hi>. An essential ingredient of our
                            domestic strength is an improved and strengthened civil defense program
                            which seeks, by both preventive and ameliorative measures, to minimize
                            damage from nuclear attack. An effective civil defense program requires
                            an increasing degree of Federal responsibility, support, and influence
                            on the Civil Defense activities of the States.</p>
                        <p>46. <hi rend="italic">Support by U.S. Citizens</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>a. No national strategy to meet the Soviet threat can be successful
                            without the support of the American people. During a time of increasing
                            Soviet nuclear power, the determination of U.S. citizens to face the
                            risks involved in carrying out such national strategy will be of
                            increasing importance. Continuing efforts should be made to inform the
                            American people of the demands on their spiritual and material resources
                            necessary to ensure U.S. security by political, military and economic
                            means during a period of armed truce, which may either continue for many
                            years or be broken by an atomic war.</p>
                        <p>b. Eternal vigilance is necessary in carrying out the national strategy,
                            to prevent the intimidation of free criticism. Necessary protective
                            measures should not be used to destroy national unity, which must be
                            based on freedom and not on fear.</p>
                        <p>47. <hi rend="italic">Mobilization Base</hi>. The mobilization base
                            (military and non-military) should be designed to meet the requirements
                            of (a) general war, initiated by the enemy with an atomic onslaught or
                            as a result of hostilities which were not intended to lead to general
                            war, (b) cold war, and (c) military conflict short of general war.
                            Emphasis should be given to those elements that will increase U.S. D-day
                            readiness and capability. The base should meet the following
                            objectives:</p>
                        <p>a. Maintenance of the active forces in a condition of optimum readiness
                            to execute initial wartime missions.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_522" n="522" facs="0546"/>
                        <p>b. Maintenance and support in a high state of readiness of those selected
                            reserve forces so essential to the execution of initial wartime missions
                            as to require their being given priority treatment.</p>
                        <p>c. Maintenance and support of phased expansion to M + 6 months force
                            levels.</p>
                        <p>d. The capacity to meet the combat requirements of all forces which would
                            be mobilized by M + 6 months.</p>
                        <p>e. Pre-D-day provision and positioning of resonably protected stocks of
                            selected supplies and equipment outside the United States to insure that
                            U.S. forces surviving the enemy atomic attack will have a reasonable
                            capability of performing assigned initial tasks effectively despite

                            briefly on the tactical use of nuclear weapons, and would be prepared
                            thereafter to answer any questions.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName> emphasized that
                            the subject of tactical use of nuclear weapons had arisen in his mind as
                            a result of particular questions directed to him earlier by the
                            Secretary of State. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName> went on to point out that public opinion in the
                            world today mostly <pb xml:id="pg_525" n="525" facs="0549"/>considers
                            nuclear weapons to be indiscriminate in character and capacity for
                            destruction, and that therefore their use is likely to induce general
                            nuclear war. The Soviets naturally encourage this illusion since, if
                            nuclear weapons were to be totally banned, the Soviets would enjoy the
                            great military advantage of their superiority in manpower. Thus, if the
                            United States were inhibited from the use of nuclear weapons we might
                            well be unable to respond to local Communist aggression. It was
                            therefore essential that public opinion come to understand that the
                            United States does possess tactical nuclear weapons, and that they can
                            be used in military operations without causing indiscriminate
                            devastation, [<hi rend="italic">remainder of paragraph and 5 additional

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> pointed out that
                            it was quite possible that the Soviets faced rather severe problems in
                            the matter of testing very large weapons, because they had no completely
                            empty spaces equivalent to our Pacific testing grounds at Bikini or
                            Eniwetok. In short, if they were to test weapons of very great magnitude
                            they might find it necessary to move whole populations. Governor
                                <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> pointed out that in
                            his speech about May 1, Marshal <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName> had claimed that the Soviet Union possessed a
                            wide variety of nuclear weapons.<note n="4" xml:id="d121fn4">No

                        <p>The President inquired about the claim recently made by the Soviets that
                            they had manufactured a nuclear bomb which was so big that they did not
                            dare to set it off. Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> indicated that this claim derived from a rumor
                            about a speech which Marshal <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName> had made to some Polish journalists.</p>
                        <p>Turning to Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>, the
                            President expressed great doubt as to whether it was possible to blow up
                            concrete pillboxes by the use of atomic weapons. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> agreed that this was doubtful,
                            but pointed out that we had alternatives to use against such
                            fortifications, as, for example, napalm bombs. Moreover, he said, with
                            our present atomic capabilities we would not expect our forces to be
                            held up by one line of pillboxes; it would be perfectly simple to go
                            around them.</p>

                        <p>On June 14 and 15, the annual Department of Defense (or Military)
                            Secretaries’ Conference was held in Quantico, Virginia. The featured
                            speaker on the morning of June 14 was Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">John Foster Dulles</persName>. The Secretary spoke
                            on the free world collective security system and its relationship to the
                            strategic concepts of massive retaliation with nuclear weapons which
                            brought “a higher degree of security at lesser cost than we could get if
                            each had to try to get that for himself” and the need to counter
                            peripheral acts of aggression with more limited warfare.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> acknowledged that massive retaliation,
                            “which has served us so well and which will continue to serve us well,
                            has certain weaknesses which have become increasingly apparent during
                            the last two or three years as the Soviet Union as well as we have
                            developed the increasingly massive destructive capability of nuclear
                            weapons.” Citing the old adage, “the punishment should fit the crime,”
                            he noted that “there is, I think, a growing question in the minds of
                            some of our allies at least as to whether or not we would, in fact,
                            invoke the power of retaliation which is represented by these terrible
                            weapons which with their fallout capacity could perhaps destroy human
                            life on the northern half of the globe,” especially if this retaliation
                            seems to be excessive in relation to the aggression.</p>
                        <p>Fortunately, <persName>Dulles</persName> continued, the United States was
                            gradually developing tactical (or small yield) nuclear weapons which
                            would effectively counter “nibbling operations” undertaken by the
                            Russians “on the theory that we would not, in fact, respond with the
                            only weapon at hand because that would involve excessive cost to
                            humanity.” He was hopeful that “these new possibilities for
                            strengthening the free world” would provide “an adequate deterrent, an
                            adequate defense,” without the United States and other free nations
                            facing the choice of spending heavily on defense at the expense of other
                            needs or burdening the populace with taxes or inflation which would
                            “destroy the economic foundation which is one of the indispensable
                            requisites of a vigorous and free society.”</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_527" n="527" facs="0551"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Dulles</persName> concluded: “Now all of this that I have been
                            talking about requires, as I think you can readily see, the closest
                            cooperation between those of us who are primarily responsible for the
                            political conduct of foreign affairs and those who are responsible for
                            our military strategy and its implementation.”</p>
                        <p>Responding to questions following his talk, <persName>Dulles</persName>
                            elaborated on the complicated problems arising from the stationing of
                            United States forces abroad, the need for United States bases abroad,
                            the financial costs of such bases, and the national resentments of
                            United States presence in foreign countries. He also commented on
                            Western colonialism which had brought racial discrimination abroad and
                            had resulted in an anti-colonial legacy in Africa and Asia. The United
                            States, he believed, “has been relatively free from the practice of
                            those discriminations abroad although by no means wholly so, but in any
                            event we are just lumped with the western Europeans, the whites, in that
                            respect.” Therefore, “we have not only our own sins to bear but also the
                            sins attributed to us by association and that is one of the very grave
                            liabilities to which we are exposed and, of course, it is sought to be
                            used for propaganda purposes by the Communists as they portray our own
                            racial problems here at home; that is used to indicate this sense of
                            white supremacy and it is a very grave problem and it affects our whole
                            military-political strategy particularly in Asia.”</p>
                        <p>One consequence of the anti-colonial mentality related to atomic weapons
                            is, <persName>Dulles</persName> noted, that “there is in the feelings of
                            the [Asian] masses identification of the atomic weapon with this white
                            supremacy and its having been used first by the United States against
                            members of the so-called yellow race, and there is a greater measure of
                            tolerance toward the development of atomic weapons, the testing of
                            atomic weapons, by the Soviet Union than there is to that development
                            and testing by the United States or Great Britain because a good many of
                            the Asians take a certain degree of quiet satisfaction over the fact
                            that a nation which is at least partly Asiatic, which has never been
                            identified with the white Europeans in terms of colonialism, that that
                            is now getting in a position to challenge the power which heretofore has
                            been a monopoly of western whites.”</p>

                        <p>On June 15 Admiral Arthur Radford delivered an address, entitled “Defense
                            Planning,” to the conference. <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>, noting that he would be completing his
                            four-year term as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in two months,
                            offered his reflections on various planning problems facing the United
                            States armed forces. He stressed the need for coordinated team work in
                            the military in approaching these problems. He also referred to “certain
                            restrictions and limitations” on the military, <pb xml:id="pg_528" n="528" facs="0552"/>such as “valid objections from a political
                            point of view” by civilian departments, which caused “unavoidable delay
                            in our planning and programming.” <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> emphasized, however: “I am not complaining—I am
                                <hi rend="italic">explaining—why</hi> it is that the Joint Chiefs
                            have great difficulties in coming up with the best solution to some of
                            our more pressing problems.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> went on to cite
                            budgetary restrictions requiring “a reasonable ceiling to be put on our
                            military expenditures,” and he affirmed that “there are better and more
                            economical ways of planning for the future.” He added: “I am certain
                            that there are actions which can be taken which will result in sizable
                            reductions in our annual military expenditures and which will not
                            materially or dangerously reduce our capabilities to successfully fight
                            a global war or the kind of limited war that we <hi rend="italic">should</hi> fight. I am also certain that if the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff do not take all or most of these actions, some more drastic and
                            less justified actions may be taken outside the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>.”</p>
                        <p>Finally, <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> made more
                            specific remarks advocating reduction of United States deployments
                            abroad, assistance to indigenous ground forces with small mobile support
                            forces, dispersal of United States forces and <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> bases, prudent procurement programs, “maintenance of
                            sufficient atomic striking power—our essential deterrent,” including
                            more rapid development of “clean” nuclear weapons, and programs designed
                            to retain skilled officers in the military, a more important concern
                            because of future reductions in personnel in all the military
                            services.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> reminded the Council
                            that the President, at the March 28 Council meeting, had requested the
                            Defense Department to prepare a report, assuming reasonable success in
                            carrying out plans for the Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile (<gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>) and the Intercontinental Ballistic
                            Missile (<gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>), which would set forth
                            the relative military advantages of these missiles in comparison with
                            manned aircraft and with non-ballistic missiles assumed to be available
                            at the same time. He then introduced General Samuel E. Anderson,
                            Director of the Weapons System Evaluation Group of the Defense
                            Department, who was to present the report.</p>
                        <p>General <persName>Anderson</persName> made his report (a copy of which is
                            filed in the minutes of the meeting).<note n="3" xml:id="d123fn3">Neither General <persName>Anderson</persName>’s report nor the
                                minutes has been found in the Eisenhower Library or Department of
                                State Files.</note> His general conclusion was to the effect that
                            for at least the period 1960 to 1967, it would continue to be necessary
                            to develop different weapons systems, including manned aircraft,
                            ballistic and aerodynamic missiles. The report also recommended a review
                            of the same problem by the Weapons System Evaluation Group at the end of
                            a year’s time.</p>
                        <p>When General <persName>Anderson</persName> had concluded his report, the
                            President asked if there were any questions from Council members.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> said he would
                            like to add one point to General <persName>Anderson</persName>’s report.
                            He indicated his view that the report given by General
                                <persName>Anderson</persName> pointed up the need for a quantitative
                            measure of the value of the several weapons systems which had been
                            discussed. While we certainly needed to be more selective in our
                            procurement of weapons, General <persName>Anderson</persName> had
                            brought out the problems which made such selectivity difficult.</p>
                        <p>The Director of the Budget said he had a question with respect to the
                            continued development of new types of manned aircraft. Were we at the
                            end of the period of spending money on the development of new types of
                            manned aircraft? Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> replied that the Department of Defense felt it
                            necessary to continue to develop new types of manned aircraft.</p>
                        <p>The President said he had one comment to make. One significant matter had
                            not been mentioned in General <persName>Anderson</persName>’s report.
                            This was understandable, because it had not been requested. This element
                            was the total economic cost in relation to the performance of different
                            weapons systems. Thus it was important that manned aircraft performed
                            their initial missions and often returned to perform subsequent
                            missions. On the other hand, missiles, once launched, never returned
                            from their target. Accordingly, this element of cost should be
                            established—at least in relative, if not absolute, terms—because
                            ultimately there was a limit to what we can afford to pay for these
                            weapons <pb xml:id="pg_530" n="530" facs="0554"/>systems. The President
                            again pointed out that the absence of reference to the cost element was
                            not to be taken as a criticism. He had not asked that this element be
                            included, and he emphasized that the report had been a very good
                            one.</p>
                        <p>The Director of Central Intelligence reminded the Council that the
                            intelligence community was following very carefully the problem of
                            estimating Soviet capabilities in the missiles field. Indeed, a National
                            Intelligence Estimate on this subject had been issued not long ago
                                (<gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11–5–57; copy filed in the
                            minutes of the meeting). A particular effort was being made to try to
                            determine on which of the various weapons systems the Soviets were
                            placing greater emphasis.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that the
                            Chiefs have been developing the Joint Strategic Objectives Plan for
                            1961. Although supposed to finish at the end of May, they had not
                            resolved differences, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> had not wanted to highlight split views at this
                            particular time. He did feel, however, that it is time to cut down force
                            strengths.</p>
                        <p>The President said he would like to see Defense prepare to go ahead with
                            the reductions without advertising them. The reductions are a major
                            bargaining point in our negotiations with the Russians. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he thought that
                            40% of the reduction should come from our forces overseas and afloat. He
                            recalled that the President had agreed last spring to taking out 35,000
                            from Europe by streamlining. He felt 40,000 could be gotten out of Japan
                            by early next year. He would like to get another 25,000 through
                            decreases overseas.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> then commented on
                            budgetary problems. The President said he did not wish to get into the
                            position of setting the exact dates for each component of the budget but
                            instead felt that he would simply set an order of magnitude. He thought
                            cuts should be made in the unobligated carryover of funds at the end of
                            fiscal years. He said he wanted to get down to the point where <gloss target="#t_NOA1">NOA</gloss>, expenditures and carryover stay
                            steady, with <gloss target="#t_NOA1">NOA</gloss> and expenditures at
                            about the same figure. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>
                            said that the tightest part of the budget for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>–58 will be the attempt to get expenditures below $38
                            billion. The President suggested that the unobligated carryover be
                            reduced by perhaps $3 billion. This would allow flexibility in
                            obligating.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, the President said he felt that cuts should be
                            begun as soon as the Administration receives the appropriation bill. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that in two or
                            three weeks he and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> would bring in a plan for the President to look
                            at.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> then referred to
                            another problem. The overexpenditures, which are chiefly in the Air
                            Force, have thrown the program of obligations out of balance. Inflated
                            costs and acceleration of the missiles program are chiefly responsible.
                            If the services are called on to cut back to $38 billion it will be
                            necessary to revise the program. This <pb xml:id="pg_532" n="532" facs="0556"/>cannot be done simply in the service that overspends.
                            Specifically, funds must be taken away from the Army, which did not
                            overspend, in order to provide added obligational authority for the Air
                            Force, which did. This action must be taken within the next month. The
                            President recognized the difficulties, but said it is up to Defense to
                            prepare the best program that can be arranged.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> asked how stiff
                            the $38 billion figure is for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>–58. The
                            President said that Defense should work for the $38 billion figure in
                            order to avoid the effort to increase taxes that would otherwise be
                            required. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he
                            would put figures together to work for it. He said that the figures
                            might run a little higher due to the effect of inflation.</p>
                        <p>Referring again to the question of personnel, the President said it
                            should be discussed in terms of a continuing process of cutting out
                            personnel, attempting to avoid the use of specific figures such as a $2½
                            million figure.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that the
                            expenditure rate for the first half of 1958 will be greater than for the
                            last half and will, as a result, carry us very close to the debt limit.
                            The President said this simply means the cut backs will have to be made
                            faster.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he would
                            have a plan for the President in mid-July.<note n="3" xml:id="d124fn3">See <ref target="#d133">Document 133</ref>.</note>

                                the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> memorandum of discussion is
                                scheduled for publication in volume XXIII</note> indicated urgent
                            need for U.S. action to reduce the mounting costs of our total defense
                            effort.</p>
                        <p>2. Whereas reductions should be made among the various elements of the
                            total defense effort so that domestic and foreign programs be kept in
                            proper balance, the Council discussion on Korea focused attention on
                            reductions in the U.S. defense effort overseas. The greatly increased
                            power of modern weapons contributes to the feasibility of such
                            reductions.</p>
                        <p>3. The Council discussion, giving fresh emphasis to the President’s
                            concept of the “New Look” in our overseas defense programs, covered (a)
                            redeploying more U.S. forces from overseas toward the U.S., (b) reducing
                            overseas indigenous forces supported by U.S. military assistance, and
                            (c) persuading our allies to place more reliance on our retaliatory
                            capability to protect them from attack. Underlying this Council
                            discussion was recognition that adjustments in our overseas programs
                            should not: (a) foster tendencies on the part of our allies to let down
                            in their support of their appropriate share of the collective deterrent;
                            (b) weaken the political foundations on which our collective security is
                            based; or (c) jeopardize our ability to apply force in a manner and on a
                            scale best calculated to avoid local hostilities from broadening into
                            general war.</p>
                        <p>4. The Planning Board could provide necessary staff work as the basis for
                            decisions under this policy development. The Planning Board could
                            prepare for Council consideration alternative courses of action,
                            together with estimates of their effects (based on coordinated
                            intelligence studies).</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_534" n="534" facs="0558"/>
                        <p>5. a. It is understood that consideration of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> area should not take place until after the German
                                elections,<note n="3" xml:id="d125fn3">The elections in West Germany
                                were held on September 15.</note> or of the Near East area until
                            specific later authorization.</p>
                        <p>b. The Planning Board could, however, now proceed to a comprehensive
                            consideration of our policy in the Far East along the lines indicated in
                            6 below. Any U.S. action which might be taken, as a result of such
                            consideration, would give weight to preserving proper balance in the
                            U.S. defense effort between this area and other areas of the world.</p>
                        <p>6. a. Such Planning Board consideration of the Far East area would take
                            into account: (1) the appropriate 1956 Prochnow Committee Reports;<note n="4" xml:id="d125fn4">The Prochnow Committee was an
                                interdepartmental committee chaired by Herbert V. Prochnow, Deputy

                        <p>b. Such consideration by the Planning Board, on the basis of this
                            memorandum, would include reexamination from the military, political,
                            economic, and psychological points of view of U.S. objectives in the
                            area; the need for U.S. presence in the area (in terms of military
                            forces and civilian personnel); the requirements for U.S. support of
                            indigenous forces in the area; inducing greater reliance by nations in
                            the area upon U.S. retaliatory power as a deterrent. Taking all the <pb xml:id="pg_535" n="535" facs="0559"/>foregoing into account, the
                            Planning Board could propose alternative recommendations as to how,
                            when, and where reductions might be made in U.S. forces deployed in the
                            area and in indigenous forces in the area supported by U.S. military
                            assistance (thereby making improvements possible in the economies of the
                            countries concerned).</p>
                        <p>7. Such a review of Far East policy could develop for the Council broad
                            principles, which would be tested by application to specific countries
                            within the area.</p>
                        <p>8. Following the completion of such Far East review, the Council could
                            determine to what extent the principles developed for that area could be
                            applied to other areas, such as <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            and the Near East.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> reminded the Council
                            that, at the President’s direction, he had requested the Secretary of
                            Defense on May 21 to arrange for a full presentation before the National
                            Security Council of all Defense Department ballistic and aerodynamic
                            missile programs.<note n="2" xml:id="d126fn2">No record of the

                                Department of State files.</note> The information requested was,
                            first, the cumulative cost of each missile program through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957 and such programs’ projected annual
                            cost estimated from <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 through
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963. Secondly, the presentation
                            was to include the estimated date of availability and retirement of each
                            missile program, with clear indication of the extent to which the
                            capabilities of each missile might overlap the capabilities of any other
                            missile.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of his briefing (a copy of which is filed in the

                            presentation would be opened by Mr. Holaday, Special Assistant <pb xml:id="pg_536" n="536" facs="0560"/>to the Secretary of Defense;
                            would be carried on by Admiral Sides; and would conclude with comments
                            by Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName>. He
                            then called on Mr. Holaday, who, after some general remarks, turned the
                            technical aspects of the presentation over to Admiral Sides. (A copy of
                            the Defense Department presentation<note n="4" xml:id="d126fn4">The

                            of the meeting.)</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of the presentation, which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> described as one of the most
                            effective reports that he had ever heard made in the National Security
                            Council, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> said
                            he wished to make a few comments on the report. He said he thought it
                            would be helpful to look at a chart which would summarize the terrible
                            dollar cost figures in terms of the four main categories of
                                missiles.<note n="5" xml:id="d126fn5">This chart and the one
                                mentioned in the next paragraph are filed in the minutes.</note> The
                            chart indicated that through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957 we
                            had spent $11.8 billion on our missile programs. The cost of continuing
                            these programs from <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957 through
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963 would amount to approximately
                            $36.1 billion, for a grand total of some $47 billion.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> followed with a
                            chart analyzing the main categories of fund requirements: for research,
                            for procurement, and for operational facilities. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> indicated his realization that
                            the resources of the United States would be insufficient to support all
                            these programs, and that some would have to be eliminated in the future
                            as others have been eliminated in the past. Under certain assumptions,
                            for example, the Navaho missile program will be completely dropped.
                            Rascal would likewise virtually be eliminated.</p>
                        <p>In explanation of these heavy expenditures, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> emphasized the dynamic nature
                            of our missile programs, pointing out that in this relatively new field
                            things changed very rapidly. After citing examples to illustrate his
                            point, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName>
                            indicated how the shifting of the technological base of our missile
                            programs had presented very tough problems for decision in the Defense
                            Department, and would continue to present such problems in the future.
                            He then invited questions from the members of the Council.</p>
                        <p>The President said that with respect to the matter of eliminating missile
                            programs, to which Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> had referred, he wished to inquire whether the
                            Defense Department conducted, so to speak, a court martial at regular
                            intervals to decide which missile programs were to be “executed”. The
                            President illustrated his point with a reference to the three missile
                            systems—Thor, Jupiter and Polaris.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> replied that a
                            court martial to determine the fate of Thor and Jupiter was being
                            convened now. The development of Polaris, on the contrary, was still so
                            far in the future that no decision could yet be made with respect to
                            this missile program.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_537" n="537" facs="0561"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> commented that he
                            did not believe we could afford to allocate more than ten percent of the
                            funds of the Defense Department for activities in the missile field.</p>
                        <p>The President then explained that he had asked his question because so
                            many of the missile systems discussed in the presentation seemed to him
                            to resemble one another quite markedly in their capabilities. He pointed
                            out that in such cases a choice must be made of the best all-round
                            program, because we could not afford to carry on so many programs in the
                            quest for a missile which would have the quality of perfection.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> replied that the
                            Defense Department had been taking a look at the total picture of its
                            missile programs every six months. Moreover, from time to time some of
                            the programs had been eliminated between these six-months intervals when
                            circumstances dictated that this could be safely done.</p>
                        <p>The President then said he wished to cite two examples which lay behind
                            his question. The missile Tartar is in the course of development, and
                            its estimated performance seemed to lie somewhere in between the Terrier
                            missile and the advanced Terrier missile. Thus, merely because a weapon
                            gave promise of slightly better capabilities, this is not a criterion
                            for continuing a program to develop this weapon when costs were so
                            extremely high. We cannot hope for a perfect family of these weapons
                            designed to achieve every purpose in warfare.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> pointed out that
                            with the over-all budget ceiling of $38 billion annually, 1/10 of this
                            amount (which Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>
                            had earlier indicated should be allocated to our missile programs) would
                            amount to $3.8 billion annually. However, the charts had indicated that
                            we had spent $11.8 billion on our missile programs in the fiscal 1956
                            and 1957. Accordingly, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> concluded, we must pull down the costs of our
                            missile programs in the future.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired whether there were any further questions from
                            members of the Council. There being no response, the President commented
                            that he guessed everybody was thunderstruck at what he had heard on the
                            subject of our missile programs and their costs.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> expressed strong
                            doubt as to the value of the Thor–Jupiter 1500-mile-range missiles, in
                            view of the situation of our bases. Such an intermediate range missile,
                            he believed, would be more useful to the Russians than to ourselves.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> inquired as to the
                            priority which had been given to the Navy’s Polaris missile. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he believed that
                            the Polaris missile deserved a priority above that accorded to Thor and
                            Jupiter.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Sides pointed out that allocating the same priority to Polaris as
                            to Thor and Jupiter would not actually cost any more money or produce a
                            missile in a shorter time. The allocation of such a priority would
                            merely assure access to the needed materials.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_538" n="538" facs="0562"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> recalled that on May 7
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> had written to
                            the President to ask whether the same priority should be accorded to
                            Polaris as had been accorded to the <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>

                            that it was Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s
                            request of May 7 which had occasioned the President’s own request for
                            the over-all presentation on our missile programs which the Council had
                            heard today.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>1. I have reviewed your “New Look” memorandum for the President (revised
                            draft, July 1, 1957).<note n="2" xml:id="d127fn2">
                                <ref target="#d125">Document 125</ref>.</note> I certainly agree
                            that there is an urgent need for U.S. action to reduce the mounting
                            costs of our total defense effort.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_539" n="539" facs="0563"/>
                        <p>2. While agreeing that there is need for careful review and utmost
                            economy in defense expenditures, I am inclined to the view that the
                            approach indicated in your memorandum is not the correct one. My basis
                            for this belief lies in the decision to adhere to a fixed financial
                            ceiling for the Department of Defense for the next several years. This
                            decision has generated a requirement for the Joint Chiefs of Staff to
                            study the over-all problem of forces and force deployments. Such a study
                            cannot be made of areas in isolation but must be made on a global basis.
                            I further feel that it is incumbent upon the Joint Chiefs of Staff to
                            arrive at their recommendations in this matter at a relatively early
                            date. The recommendations of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, if approved by
                            the Secretary of Defense, would then become the military foundation of
                            such further work to be accomplished by the Planning Board and the
                            National Security Council.</p>
                        <p>3. It seems to me that an approach as indicated above will keep <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> consideration of this most important
                            subject in proper perspective, and I recommend its consideration in lieu
                            of the program outlined in your memorandum.</p>

                            requested for the Department of Defense was $38.5 billion, including
                            items for later transmission. The House of Representatives considered a
                            total of $36.128 billion and <pb xml:id="pg_541" n="541" facs="0565"/>reduced this amount by $2.574 billion. The Senate approved a
                            restoration of $971 million. The Senate–House Conference has not acted,
                            and while it is difficult to appraise accurately, they may recommend a
                            compromise figure by restoring about two-thirds of this amount.</p>
                        <p>The action in reducing the new obligational authority for military
                            construction resulted in a further reduction of $450 million from the
                            $2.1 billion in the original Defense Budget. From the above it now
                            appears that the total appropriation for the Department of Defense for
                            Fiscal Year 1958 may be approximately $36 billion. By utilizing
                            unobligated carry-over funds, we can take care of a $38 billion program
                            in Fiscal Year 1958. However, the Fiscal Year 1958 appropriations of $36
                            billion and the use of carry-over funds to maintain the program of $38
                            billion will require the Department of Defense to request appropriations
                            for Fiscal Year 1959 of approximately $38 billion if the cost of the
                            military program is to continue at this level. This will give the
                            appearance outwardly of a step-up in our military program of
                            approximately $2 billion which will be difficult to explain to the
                            Congress and the country.</p>
                        <p>2. Your Budget Message contained an estimate of expenditures of $38
                            billion for Fiscal Year 1958 for the Department of Defense. It is my
                            understanding that you feel the Department of Defense should operate
                            within this amount, and the military programs for Fiscal Year 1958
                            should be adjusted accordingly. You have also directed that the
                            Department of Defense should be limited to $38 billion in Fiscal Year
                            1959 for both new obligational authority and expenditures.</p>
                        <p>Based upon an analysis of the expenditures for the period January–June
                            1957, the Department of Defense is currently operating at a level of
                            expenditures of approximately $40.250 billion. This rate, if projected
                            on an annual basis, is as follows:</p>

                        <p>The question of expenditures is further complicated by the restrictions
                            on our program as a result of the effect of the debt ceiling under which
                            the Administration is operating. Since the current operations of the
                            Department of Defense are at a rate of approximately $40.250 billion,
                            the Department of Defense is faced with the necessity of radically
                            reducing the rate of expenditures in the early part of Fiscal Year 1958.
                            In addition to the reduction of the program for Fiscal Year 1958, all
                            possible measures within the authority of the Department of Defense are
                            being considered which will reduce the drain on the Treasury for the
                            first half of the Fiscal Year. It will be particularly difficult to meet
                            the expenditure limitations during the first half of Fiscal Year 1958,
                            and some relief in this regard may be necessary.</p>
                        <p>3. A further complicating factor in the military program is the effect of
                            increased prices, and this effect in Fiscal Years 1958 and 1959 cannot
                            be fully estimated at this time. The recent increase in wages and prices
                            in the steel industry is an example of the situation we face. To the
                            degree that price increases must be absorbed within an expenditure
                            ceiling of $38 billion, our military program would have to be
                            correspondingly further reduced. The proposed reduction in the military
                            program contained in this memorandum makes no allowance for further
                            price increases.</p>
                        <p>4. To maintain a balanced military program, it appears necessary at this
                            time not only to reduce procurement but to also make adjustments in the
                            personnel strengths of the military services as indicated in the

                        <p>In order to effect the above reductions, it will be necessary to reduce
                            the present 1,150,000 military personnel serving overseas and afloat by
                            approximately 100,000 in Fiscal Year 1958. It appears that these
                            reductions can be made without major redeployment of combat units from
                            Europe although the total personnel of 350,000 in Western Europe must be
                            reduced by at least 35,000 during Fiscal Year 1958, principally in the
                            Army and Air Force. Since some of the personnel in Japan will be
                            redeployed to other areas in the Far East, a further reduction in the
                            personnel serving in the Pacific area may be required in addition to the
                            already-announced plans for reducing personnel in Japan by 40,000. The
                            reduction in personnel serving afloat will require a reduction in the
                            number of combat ships in commission by approximately 66 during Fiscal
                            Year 1958.</p>
                        <p>Military personnel serving in U.S. territories and possessions must be
                            reduced as a part of the overall plan. This will reduce transportation
                            costs and reduce further construction of facilities and housing. As an
                            example, it appears desirable to withdraw most of the combat ground
                            forces from Hawaii which would have the additional advantage of avoiding
                            housing costs and overinflating that area.</p>
                        <p>An overall reduction of military personnel abroad will reduce the
                            dependents abroad, and some savings, particularly in transportation and
                            support, will result.</p>
                        <p>The required personnel reductions abroad during Fiscal Year 1959 are
                            difficult to determine at this time. They may require either further
                            unit withdrawals from the Far East or reduction in combat forces in
                            Western Europe.</p>
                        <p>The personnel reductions recommended in Fiscal Year 1958 should be made
                            as early as possible, and since they will require the release of a large
                            number of Reserve officers (approximately 20,000 in Fiscal Year 1958)
                            from active duty and will also affect our draft calls for the entire
                            year, an early announcement of these plans should be made. It will not
                            be necessary to announce the personnel plans for Fiscal Year 1959 until
                            they are finalized in your 1959 Budget, but their tentative approval is
                            required at this time in order that the military services can be
                            appropriately guided during the next six months and in order that the
                            two programs can be consistent over the two-year period.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_544" n="544" facs="0568"/>
                        <p>An important reduction in civilian personnel in each of the military
                            departments will be possible with this proposed reduction in the
                            program. Some of this reduction would involve U.S. citizen civilians
                            abroad.</p>
                        <p>5. Under the above personnel ceilings, it is believed that the following
                            major forces can be maintained through Fiscal Year 1959:</p>

                        <p>For your information, the presently existing forces and those originally
                            planned for end Fiscal Years 1958 and 1959 are attached.<note n="4" xml:id="d129fn4">Not printed.</note> The forces listed in the above
                            program represent a preliminary appraisal of those that can be
                            maintained in an effective state of readiness. After a careful review,
                            it may be found practicable to increase them slightly and they will, of
                            course, phase down to these figures on a gradual basis over the two-year
                            period. As unnecessary support or logistic activities are uncovered, the
                            additional personnel will be channeled into combat units. A more precise
                            figure for all categories will be furnished you after complete staffing
                            following your decision on the outlined plan herein presented. It is
                            important to note that the general view among the senior officers, both
                            civilian and military, in the Department <pb xml:id="pg_545" n="545" facs="0569"/>of Defense is that it is more important to modernize
                            equipment and maintain the units at a high state of readiness than to
                            hold the number of personnel and units at a high level.</p>
                        <p>6. The greatest immediate impact of the $38 billion expenditure plan will
                            occur in the procurement field, particularly in aircraft and related
                            procurement in the Air Force, aircraft and ship building in the Navy,
                            and the procurement of missiles of all types in all services. Some
                            important reductions in employment and activity will occur in some
                            segments of the aircraft and electronic industries.</p>
                        <p>Also substantial cancellations are indicated in the missile field, some
                            of which will affect employment and will have to be made prior to
                            complete testing of the missiles concerned. The magnitude of the program
                            as originally contemplated and its increasing cost due both to technical
                            difficulties and basic cost increases is just too big.</p>
                        <p>Even with the adjustment in our military programs, the money available
                            for expenditures for modernization is in the opinion of the military and
                            civilians in the Defense Department a minimum. While we undoubtedly have
                            a powerful military organization, it is also considered to be an
                            absolute minimum in the absence of a real improvement in the
                            international situation.</p>
                        <p>7. As you know, in addition to the funds budgeted for research and
                            development, substantial funds are devoted to development from the
                            procurement and production accounts. It is anticipated that all funds
                            currently in the 1958 budget for research and development as finally
                            approved by the Congress will be expended for this purpose and that any
                            net reduction in the level of research and development will be effected
                            by savings in the procurement and production accounts with corresponding
                            increases in procurement for service use.</p>
                        <p>8. The final action in reducing the new obligational authority requested
                            of Congress for military construction to $1.650 billion will delay
                            important activities in this field. It is expected that it will have a
                            substantial effect upon the operational readiness dates of the early
                            warning system, the Continental Air Defense system, and the dispersal of
                            the Strategic Air Forces. Action on this request is still pending in the
                            Congress. We hope it will not be further reduced.</p>
                        <p>9. Some reduction in the level of support given to the Reserve Forces in
                            all services will have to be considered in order that any savings
                            resulting in these accounts may be applied to other more urgent needs.
                            The greatest difficulty expected in this area is the adverse public and
                            political reaction should these forces be reduced materially below those
                            presently programmed. However, in view of the presently approved
                            strategic concepts, the reduction in the Reserve Forces appears to be
                            indicated in the order of 15% by the end of Fiscal Year 1959. Only those
                            forces can be justified that can be brought into operation in the early
                            stages of an emergency.</p>

                            proposals. They were prepared on a basis of expenditures for the
                            Department of Defense of $39.0 billion rather than $38.0 billion. Since
                            their views are in substantial disagreement, there seems to be no reason
                            to ask them to re-work their submissions at this time until they are
                            given further guidance.</p>
                        <p>From my personal study of the matter, the effects of the reductions
                            discussed above are deserving of the most serious consideration.
                            However, if no additional funds can be made available, they appear to be
                            mandatory.</p>
                        <p>It we are to meet the $38 billion expenditure for Fiscal Year 1958,
                            prompt action must be taken or we will be forced into more drastic
                            actions later in this Fiscal Year. Should this occur, the effect upon
                            our Fiscal Year 1959 and subsequent programs would be most disruptive
                            and uneconomical.</p>
                        <p>I recommend that you discuss the above program with the Service
                            Secretaries and the Joint Chiefs of Staff collectively and that we have
                            your decision as soon as practicable. I feel very strongly that the
                            Fiscal Year 1958 revised program should be discussed with Congressional
                            leaders before being made public, particularly the changes in personnel
                            strengths for Fiscal Year 1958. Following such a meeting I would
                            recommend that you issue a public statement in this regard.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> handed to the
                            President a memorandum dated July tenth concerning the military program
                            for fiscal year 1958–59.<note n="2" xml:id="d130fn2">
                                <hi rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note> The President read it
                            carefully. He then said that he agreed with the proposal regarding the
                            total strength of 2.5 million, but did not necessarily agree with the
                            distribution to services. As to the other provisions of the memorandum,
                            he thought they looked sensible, but would not say that this is exactly
                            what is to be done. The President thought that our position should be
                            that, in view of the action of the Congress, the Department of Defense
                            must plan on appropriations of approximately $36 billion for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958; expenditures must be kept to $38
                            billion, and even this figure exceeds <gloss target="#t_NOA1">NOA</gloss> by $2 billion. Unless Congress appropriates more in
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 59, further reductions will be
                            required. He said that his reading of the memorandum led him to think
                            that it proposes generally a good plan. He would not, of course, approve
                            every detail.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that the
                            Administration must inform Congress of the military program it plans to
                            carry out. The President said he was quite willing to write letters to
                            appropriate leaders of the Congress on this matter. He was inclined to
                            question the usefulness of any long discussion of the matter with the
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> stressed that both the military and civilian
                            heads of the services would feel much better for such a discussion. The
                            President said that the problem is that he is, as of now, not in
                            position to make specific decisions such as the indicated cut of 150
                            thousand for the Army. The Chiefs would know that he was being purely
                            arbitrary. He felt he had had general discussions before which should
                            serve the purpose indicated.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> then went on to report
                            that there is about $25 billion in outstanding orders “hanging out” in
                            the future, and if prices continue to rise the cost of these contracts
                            may increase materially before the bills are paid. The President said
                            this simply confirmed his view that we must state publicly that we have
                            been studying the matter intensively in view of the Congressional cuts
                            and have arrived at certain decisions which must be put into effect
                            immediately. He would also indicate that rising prices may, in effect,
                            necessitate further reductions. <pb xml:id="pg_548" n="548" facs="0572"/>He thought there should be two letters, one to the Congress, and the
                            second a letter back to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> based on Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s memo. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he had told Congressman Mahon<note n="3" xml:id="d130fn3">Representative George H. Mahon (D.–Tex.).</note>
                            that he would provide a new program as soon as Defense knew how much
                            money would be available.</p>
                        <p>The President brought out that it would not be wise to use specific
                            figures publicly. For example, use of the 2.5 million figure would
                            destroy our negotiating position with the Soviets in the disarmament
                            discussions now being conducted by Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>.<note n="4" xml:id="d130fn4">For documentation
                                on disarmament negotiations May–July 1957, see volume xx.</note> He
                            asked whether the information could not be given in Executive Session
                            without public disclosure. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that so many programs must be readjusted to
                            their figures, and they must be disseminated so widely, that knowledge
                            of them would leak. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>
                            also said that Congress had given enough money to support the present
                            personnel strengths. He and his immediate assistants did not feel,
                            however, that such heavy cuts should be made in procurement as would be
                            made if personnel strengths were kept at present figures. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> thought he might state in the
                            letters that new strength figures would be set in the Budget Message
                            next January. In the meantime, he would simply take action to “pinch
                            down” 100,000 in strength by January first.</p>
                        <p>The President said it would be desirable to cut down in his estimation on
                            the proportion of officers. Never before have we tried to maintain full
                            strength in officers in peacetime. He thought the reports should state
                            that we had estimated a certain amount as required; we have received a
                            certain lesser amount; we will use up a certain amount of our balance;
                            there are certain cost increases lying out ahead of us; and to meet this
                            situation certain actions must be taken, in over-all effect along the
                            lines suggested in Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s memorandum.</p>

                        <p>I forward herewith the divergent views of the Chiefs of Staff of the Army
                            and Air Force and of the Chief of Naval Operations, together with a
                            memorandum by the Commandant of the Marine Corps on this subject.<note n="3" xml:id="d131fn3">Not attached and not found in the Eisenhower
                                Library or Department of State files.</note> You will note that
                            these submissions were prepared on a basis of expenditures for the
                            Department of Defense of $39 billion rather than $38 billion. Since
                            their views are in disagreement at the higher figure, I feel little
                            purpose would be served to ask them to rework their submissions until
                            they are given further guidance.</p>
                        <p>In formulating my own views concerning this subject I have been mindful
                            of several considerations, and prior to indicating my specific
                            proposals, would desire to comment briefly on these points.</p>
                        <p>a. A major point to be taken into consideration is the financial one.
                            Under a level ceiling for Defense expenditures over the next few years
                            and with consideration for the necessity for modernization, together
                            with the rising costs of new equipment, it is apparent that a cold look
                            must be taken at the entire force structure with a view to determining
                            which elements are necessary and how best and most efficiently to
                            utilize the monies made available to the Military Departments by the
                            Congress. In this connection I would comment simply that, in my opinion,
                            it is more important to modernize than to attempt to hold a high level
                            of personnel in the military services.</p>
                        <p>b. We must thoroughly understand and accept the strategic concept which
                            has been approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Secretary of
                            Defense, and the President. If we adhere to the principles of this
                            concept, and in light of the probable conditions which would exist in
                            general war, it is apparent that we should re-examine our plans for
                            large-scale deployments of U.S. forces, particularly ground forces,
                            overseas in the first six months after D-day. Further, I would invite
                            attention to the definition of local aggression (or limited war) which
                            has been provided in the approved Basic National Security Policy (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 570//8).<note n="4" xml:id="d131fn4">
                                <ref target="#d120">Document 120</ref>.</note> This definition
                            clearly indicates that there will be no large-scale employment of U.S.
                            forces, particularly ground forces, in <pb xml:id="pg_550" n="550" facs="0574"/>armed conflict short of general war. It is obvious then
                            that there is, under these circumstances, no requirement for a large
                            strategic reserve of ground forces in the United States.</p>
                        <p>c. An important factor which should have an influence on our force
                            structure is the Military Aid and Assistance Program. This program has
                            made possible the development of indigenous force capabilities
                            throughout the world. These forces are designed to, can now, and should
                            continue to make a substantial contribution to the security of the U.S.
                            and our Allies. Our global planning must take these forces into account
                            and, in the development of our own force structure, we must consider
                            their capabilities. As the forces developed through the Military Aid and
                            Assistance Program are primarily in the form of ground forces and some
                            tactical air forces, I would feel justified in recommending some
                            substantial reductions and definite changes in the Army force structure,
                            together with substantial reductions in our tactical air units.</p>
                        <p>d. Another factor which must be considered is the increased fire power
                            and capabilities of new weapons coming into inventory. Such new weapons
                            and systems cannot be merely additive. In part, their effect can and
                            should be applied to increase capabilities. In part, their effectiveness
                            should be reflected in a decrease in current forces. Our tendency in the
                            past, however, has been to apply the entire increase to capabilities. We
                            can no longer do this. A case in point is the numerical strength of Air
                            Force wings and Navy and Marine Corps squadrons. The number of aircraft
                            in these units has been kept constant or increased while at the same
                            time the aircraft themselves possess greatly increased capabilities. I
                            believe we can safely reduce the complement of aircraft assigned to
                            units.</p>
                        <p>e. Political and psychological factors have an influence on our force
                            structure. This is particularly true in regard to overseas deployments.
                            Under a level budgetary ceiling I am convinced that the United States
                            cannot continue year after year to maintain large overseas ground forces
                            and land-based air forces without reducing our own security. As certain
                            of these forces are redeployed I feel that they either can be phased out
                            of the military program or their place taken by smaller units which
                            could lend specialized support to the indigenous forces in overseas
                            areas.</p>
                        <p>f. Another factor which influences my thinking regarding our force
                            structure is the questionable effectiveness of some of our weapon
                            systems development programs. I am thinking here particularly of the
                            philosophy of close-in air defense of targets in the continental United
                            States under conditions of possible attack by high-yield weapons. Little
                            purpose would be served in expending additional large sums of money on
                            these systems when the resultant over-all damage to the United States in
                            an attack would not be materially decreased. With consideration for our
                            budgetary situation, I feel that we should rely more heavily on our
                            early warning system and our retaliatory capability, and would therefore
                            suggest holding in abeyance or reducing certain continental air defense
                            programs, particularly short-range fighter interceptors and short-range
                            missiles. I would further recommend serious study of ways and means of
                            moving our continental air defenses outside the border of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_551" n="551" facs="0575"/>
                        <p>g. I am convinced that D-day forces and forces which are immediately
                            available subsequent to D-day are the only ones which would contribute
                            appreciably to U.S. security in general war, as well as being the most
                            readily available forces to cope with situations short of general war.
                            Therefore, the selected reserve forces must be those, and only those,
                            which can be brought into operation in the early stages of an emergency.
                            I feel that the selected reserve forces force requirements, as stated by
                            the various Chiefs of Services, are so large that the selective
                            definition of these forces has lost its meaning.</p>
                        <p>With the foregoing considerations in mind, I forward below my
                            recommendation concerning budget expenditures, within the 38 billion
                            dollar limitation for the Department of Defense, for the Services for
                            the fiscal years 1959 through 1961, together with an approximation of
                            the total military personnel within the Services, and my thoughts
                            regarding a general order of magnitude of major forces.</p>

                            indicated in the Air Force submission.</p>
                        <p>It may be appreciated that the effect of the reductions indicated above
                            will be severe. If present inflationary trends continue, it will
                            probably be necessary to make further reductions in military personnel
                            and major forces. It is my opinion, however, that in view of the
                            increased effectiveness of modern weapons and the approved strategic
                            concept, the force structure indicated above will not necessitate
                            acceptance of an unreasonable calculated risk to the security of the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>In connection with these manpower reductions, I would invite particular
                            attention to the necessity for reduction of overseas deployments. So
                            long as the Korean truce status remains essentially unchanged, I feel it
                            would be most difficult and unwise to reduce U.S. ground forces in Korea
                            below the two division level. This leaves us our <pb xml:id="pg_553" n="553" facs="0577"/>

                            reduction in ground forces, associated tactical air forces, and their
                            supporting structure in Europe. We must face up to this problem.</p>
                        <p>I recommend an early decision on this subject in order that program
                            planning may proceed on an orderly basis.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> said this item covered a
                            paper which he had drafted following the Council’s discussion in June on
                            the size of the Korean forces supported by U.S. aid. The Korean
                            discussion had broadened into consideration of the U.S. over-all defense
                            effort. The revised draft dated July 1, incorporating suggestions from
                            various sources, was the paper before the Council. In essence, this
                            revised draft proposed that the Planning Board study the Far East with
                            reference to feasible reductions in U.S. forces deployed there and in
                            indigenous forces supported by U.S. aid.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then noted that Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>, after studying the
                            revised draft, had commented as follows:</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_554" n="554" facs="0578"/>
                        <p>“While agreeing that there is need for careful review and utmost economy
                            in defense expenditures, I am inclined to the view that the approach
                            indicated in your memorandum is not the correct one. My basis for this
                            belief lies in the decision to adhere to a fixed financial ceiling for
                            the Department of Defense for the next several years. This decision has
                            generated a requirement for the Joint Chiefs of Staff to study the
                            over-all problem of forces and force deployments. Such a study cannot be
                            made of areas in isolation but must be made on a global basis. I further
                            feel that it is incumbent upon the Joint Chiefs of Staff to arrive at
                            their recommendations in this matter at a relatively early date. The
                            recommendations of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, if approved by the
                            Secretary of Defense, would then become the military foundation of such
                            further work to be accomplished by the Planning Board and the National
                            Security Council.”<note n="3" xml:id="d132fn3">

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> said that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> proposal seemed to him to have the
                            merit of (a) being global in approach, an obvious necessity before
                            decisive action in any one area can be taken, and (b) producing prompt
                            military advice as to U.S. overseas force levels requisite to a Planning
                            Board study.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then asked Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> to comment upon his
                            proposal, and particularly to indicate whether, in addition to the
                            budgetary limitation, the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> review
                            would take into account (a) the much increased fire power given by
                            modern weapons to smaller forces; (b) a review of the missions and
                            commitments of U.S. forces overseas in the light of the current world
                            situation; and (c) consideration, in addition to U.S. force levels
                            deployed overseas, of indigenous force levels supported by U.S. aid, on
                            the basis not only of military factors and budgetary limitations for
                            fiscal years 1958 and 1959 for foreign military and economic aid, but
                            also taking into account political and economic ingredients (such as
                            keeping a current regime in control, the pride and position of an
                            indigenous regime, outbidding Communist aid offers, indigenous economic
                            capabilities, etc.).</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> said the Joint
                            Chiefs’ review would certainly take into account the first question
                            noted by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>. The second
                            and third questions, especially the second, would be taken into
                            consideration to the extent possible. However, the third question
                            involved a difficult consideration. The Joint Chiefs of Staff could
                            recommend that indigenous force levels be reduced because U.S. forces
                            would be used to assist the country attacked. But it is sometimes hard
                            to convince other countries that they can rely upon us. No military man
                            in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> disagrees with the statement
                            that the U.S. deterrent power is the principal reason for the

                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> then said he had
                            talked to the Joint Chiefs of Staff since he wrote the memorandum from
                            which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> had read. As a
                            result of this talk, he could not guarantee that the Joint Chiefs could
                            produce an agreed paper on the subject.</p>
                        <p>The President referred to his statement at the Council meeting on
                            December 21, 1956, that except in the event of some unforeseen critical
                            emergency of an international or economic character, he would not
                            request from the Congress during his term in office new obligational
                            authority for the Department of Defense above $39 billion in any fiscal
                                year.<note n="4" xml:id="d132fn4">See <ref target="#d101">Document
                                    101</ref>.</note> The President said he wanted everyone to note
                            the qualifications in this statement. He didn’t want to create the
                            impression that he was sticking to a flat ceiling regardless of war,
                            disaster, death and disease.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said he was
                            pleased that the President was not establishing a fixed flat sum as a
                            ceiling in defense expenditures. In Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>’s view, inflation could not be
                            controlled if level expenditure programs continued over a long period.
                            Present spending promotes inflationary pressures which cannot be
                            controlled in the absence of a reduction in spending. The President said
                            that an important factor in our disarmament efforts was a possible
                            reduction in military expenditures.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he would
                            like to make a presentation to the Council on the military programs for

                            He noted that each of the Services had, in proposals to him, taken more
                            than its share of the $39 billion figure set by the President; in fact,
                            the sum of Army, Navy and Air Force requests was $42 or $43 billion.</p>
                        <p>In his presentation, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, he would like to describe his money plan, his
                            personnel plan, and his redeployment plan. He was afraid he would have
                            trouble getting $38 billion next year for military purposes. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> also felt it would
                            be difficult to get $38 billion. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he did not agree with the Secretary of the
                            Treasury that military spending was causing inflation. The President
                            said perhaps not, but certainly Government spending was a contributory
                            factor in the present inflation.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> noted that
                            Treasury was now facing some difficult problems. Another five cents of
                            the dollar had recently been lost, and Treasury was just about to have
                            to pay much higher interest rates. The President said that whatever the
                            cause, inflation was proceeding.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that greater
                            responsibility had been imposed upon him because of the difference of
                            opinion which had developed in the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He had
                            reviewed this difference of opinion with <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName>, and had developed the Defense program
                            for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 and <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959 which had been presented by General Randall. With
                            respect to the Army, the basic assumption underlying this program was
                            that a change was taking place in the relationship between numbers of
                            men and fire power. The program also assumed that a substantial
                            redeployment of U.S. forces from Europe would be necessary. U.S. forces
                            had been deployed to Europe for five years at a time when our only
                            feasible action seemed to be the provision of marching men.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he was
                            proceeding on the principle of spending money where it would do the most
                            good for national security, even if this involved departing from
                            historical principles of allocation of funds among the Services. He said
                            he did not agree with the program of missile development which the Army
                            had proposed. For example, he felt the development of substantial Nike
                            capabilities in the Middle West would not be worth what it would cost.
                            He had decided not to go ahead with such a missile program, costing $500
                            to $800 million. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>
                            then displayed a chart indicating that missile expenditures were at the
                            rate of $225 million a month in June.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he
                            sympathized with the Army’s position, and realized that <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Taylor</persName> appeared to be farther
                            out of line than the other Services in his personnel proposals,
                            primarily because of our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            commitments. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>
                            said he had considered 50,000 men as the “divisional slice” for the
                            Army. The correctness of this figure would depend on how many outside
                            divisional organizations were used. He said he felt we could get along
                            through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959 with 850,000 men in the
                            Army, keeping two divisions in Korea and five under-strength divisions
                            in Europe. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> noted
                                <pb xml:id="pg_558" n="558" facs="0582"/>parenthetically that we
                            should perhaps adopt the UK system of making our divisions under
                            strength when it was desirable for political reasons to maintain a
                            certain number of divisions overseas.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said the
                            possibility of keeping one division and one regimental combat team in
                            Korea had also been discussed in the Pentagon, as had the possibility of
                            deploying two Marine divisions to Korea.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the Navy, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> recalled that naval forces in the last few years
                            had frequently been called upon to take action in emergencies short of
                            war, e.g., the Tachen Islands, Formosa, and the Middle East. The Navy
                            was a mobile, immediately available force, as was the Air Force; whereas
                            the Army and the Marine Corps faced the problem of landing divisions in
                            some foreign country’s territory. The Secretary said the United States
                            was now doing something new in history—that is, it was keeping strong
                            U.S. forces which, however, were not occupation forces, in foreign
                            countries in time of peace. He felt that political pressures would
                            eventually force us to bring our forces home. These pressures were
                            becoming particularly strong in Japan. The trend of the times was toward
                            maximizing air power, including naval air power, and minimizing the foot
                            soldier.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that perhaps
                                <persName corresp="#p_PLGRM1">General Pate</persName>’s plea for
                            deferring additional cuts in the Marine Corps until <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959, on account of the timing of the
                            expiration of Marine Corps enlistments, should be taken into account in
                            planning the Defense program in detail. However, the statutes relating
                            to the Marine Corps, while they prescribed the number of Marine Corps
                            divisions, did not say how many men should be in each division.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that the
                            Defense program was subject to detailed staffing. The figures for the
                            division of total manpower and funds between Services should be regarded
                            as order of magnitude figures only. The allocation between the Services
                            might be incorrect by as much as $500 million for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the Air Force, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> remarked that big ideas were being developed in
                            all fields of activity. He realized, however, that the Air Force was
                            faced with keeping manned planes in operation and at the same time
                            developing guided missiles. It was difficult to weigh the military value
                            in relation to cost of some of the new ideas for the development of new
                            planes, new missiles, and new methods of propulsion.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said the problem
                            of the Defense budget was complicated by economic inflation, which had
                            increased Defense costs by as much as 5%, or $2 billion, over the last
                            year. He thought that U.S. forces must be reduced if Defense was to live
                            within its $38 billion ceiling, but warned that continued inflation
                            might make it impossible to maintain this ceiling. He felt that unless
                            disarmament <pb xml:id="pg_559" n="559" facs="0583"/>were agreed upon,
                            it would be impossible to reduce U.S. forces below the figures contained
                            in the Defense presentation. He was sure that unless we could redeploy
                            the Army in the next few years, it would be difficult to live within the
                            $38 billion ceiling. Moreover, if personnel were not reduced, the United
                            States would be spending all its defense dollars on personnel and
                            maintenance.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he had
                            divided the cost of each Service by the number of men, and had found
                            that one man in the Army cost $10,000 per year, one man in the Marine
                            Corps cost $9,000, one man in the Navy cost $14,000, one man in the Air
                            Force cost $20,000. This meant that in reallocating funds among the
                            Services, if we take one man out of the Air Force, we get two back in
                            the Army.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> said he
                            regretted the lack of unanimity in the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He had
                            repeatedly emphasized to the Joint Chiefs the fact that their failure to
                            agree automatically required that their decisions be made for them by
                            higher authority. He said the Joint Chiefs realized that a sound economy
                            was a necessary U.S. capability, but were unable to agree on a detailed
                            allocation of military expenditures. The plan produced by the Secretary
                            of Defense was an extension of the New Look of 1953 brought up to date.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> felt that
                            the Services could decrease the impact of a reduction in forces by
                            reducing the strength of their units (divisions, wings, etc.). Such a
                            reduction in the strength of units would be justified because of recent
                            increases in fire power. It was unnecessary to keep the same number of
                            planes in a wing now that each plane had a capability equal to a whole
                            World War II mission.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> also felt that
                            redeployment could be compensated for. He said the concept of tactical
                            air support would have to be changed because our tactical airfields in
                            Europe, for example, were vulnerable to destruction by guided missiles.
                            Moreover, we would be justified in reducing our present forces for air
                            defense of the United States, since the present plan could not protect
                            against the guided missiles of the future. Our program for the Air Force
                            must envisage great change in Air Force structure as guided missiles are
                            developed.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName>
                            said the Defense program was based on the principle of deterring a
                            general war, but was not intended to be a reaction to every change in
                            Soviet capabilities.</p>
                        <p>The Deputy Secretary of Defense said he believed the $38 billion ceiling
                            provided the means with which to maintain a satisfactory defense
                            posture, provided the necessary readjustments were made promptly.
                            However, he felt it would be difficult to convince Congress that Defense
                            needed as much as $38 billion a year at a time when our forces were
                            being reduced. The new weapons which, in part, take the place of men,
                            were just as costly, or more costly, than the men replaced.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_560" n="560" facs="0584"/>
                        <p>The President said he appreciated the frankness of the presentations. He
                            cautioned that everything said at the meeting should be kept absolutely
                            secret. He said there was danger in assuming that we would continue to
                            get $38 billion annually from Congress. He had already pointed out the
                            dangers of a severe reduction in the budget for national defense.
                            Nevertheless, Congress had now reduced new obligational authority to $36
                            billion. The President said we should review the history of
                            Congressional appropriations for the armed forces. He recalled that
                            right after World War II he had told President Truman that we could get
                            along on $15 billion a year, but that figure had been reduced to $12.8
                            billion. The President said he was prepared to fight for a figure of $38
                            billion a year, but realized he might not be able to get that much. He
                            said that he expected anyone who had anything to do with the Defense
                            budget to defend the figure of $38 billion a year. Given the necessary
                            determination, we could make the required adjustments in our defense
                            programs, including redeployment of our forces. The President said he
                            realized that the Army and the Marine Corps had the most difficult
                            problem, and said that perhaps reductions in these forces should not go
                            quite so fast. However, in order to develop missiles we must make
                            reductions somewhere.</p>
                        <p>Referring to General White’s<note n="7" xml:id="d133fn7">General Thomas
                                D. White, Chief of Staff, <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>.</note> presentation, the President said he was
                            astonished that the Air Force should be puzzled by the varying number of
                            wings—ranging from 70 to 137—authorized from time to time. It was
                            inevitable that the organization and concepts of the Air Force undergo
                            great changes in the midst of a scientific revolution— and we were in
                            the midst of a scientific revolution. It should be remembered that the
                            Korean war and the increase in our nuclear weapons stockpile were only
                            two of the factors that influenced the number of wings in the Air
                            Force.</p>
                        <p>The President then said that the cheapest and best military organization
                            is one which is continuously developing and advancing on a stable basis
                            over an extended period of time. He said we need not count on getting 17
                            divisions deployed to Europe by M + 6. In the event of general war, our
                            retaliatory power would be the important factor.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the President repeated that $38 billion was the figure for
                            which he would fight, but cautioned against the assumption that as much
                            as $38 billion would be available every year. He remarked that Defense
                            should develop only those programs which could be continued over a
                            period of years.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General Twining</persName>, called upon by
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, said that in
                            his view $38 billion annually would enable the United States to build
                            deterrent forces. He believed Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s allocation among the <pb xml:id="pg_561" n="561" facs="0585"/>Services was a reasonable one, but wished to
                            point out that this allocation and the $38 billion ceiling would require
                            substantial redeployment of our forces.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State said that the Defense programs had foreign policy
                            implications. He hoped that no decisions would be made on the Defense
                            proposal without allowing the Department of State more time to consider
                            these political implications. In the Defense presentation, General
                            Randall had said that the Department of State would have the job of
                            making redeployment of U.S. forces acceptable to foreign countries.
                            However, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said it
                            was not clear just what was meant, in specific terms, by the proposed
                            redeployments. The Department of State would need to study detailed
                            plans for redeployment before it could comment usefully on the political
                            implications. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’
                            immediate reaction was that it would be better to reduce the size of our
                            divisions in Europe than to pull these divisions out. He said that if we
                            pulled all our forces out of Korea, President Rhee might start a war,
                            and this would certainly not be conducive to a reduction in our military
                            expenditures.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then said that
                            low-level military officers frequently carried out a military program
                            with which they did not agree, in such a way as to cause maximum
                            political embarrassment. In the case of redeployments, if the rumor that
                            we were pulling out of Germany, for example, became current, the
                            Socialists might win the election there and then we would have no West
                            German forces.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> felt it was
                            important to maintain Navy and Marine Corps capabilities to cope with
                            new crises around the world. He said that the mobility of these forces,
                            and the fact that they did not need to have permanent bases on foreign
                            territory, meant that we could place great reliance on them to take
                            action in the “trouble spots” of the world. However, the specific
                            capabilities of the Navy and Marine Corps had never been made entirely
                            clear to him.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then warned that
                            our allies may not be willing to supply sufficient indigenous forces to
                            compensate for reductions or redeployments of U.S. forces. He said if
                            our Mutual Security Program should be reduced, the United States might
                            have to increase its forces to compensate for the lack of indigenous
                            forces overseas.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> was convinced
                            that Soviet power was constantly increasing, if the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> gets the impression that U.S. power
                            is declining, it will be encouraged to keep up its military expenditures
                            in spite of their burden on the Soviet economy.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> concluded by
                            repeating the hope that no long-range decisions on U.S. military
                            programs would be taken until the Department of State was afforded an
                            opportunity to study the political implications of the proposed
                            programs.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_562" n="562" facs="0586"/>
                        <p>The President said that U.S. forces committed to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> were supposed to be emergency forces. The original
                            concept was that the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries
                            would eventually supply their own forces. However, they had never really
                            fulfilled their obligations in this respect.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> said this was Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>’s swan song, and
                            asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> if he
                            had any comments.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said this would
                            be the last Council meeting he would attend. He thanked the President
                            and the members of the Council for the privilege of working with them,
                            and said he would miss them in the future. He said he agreed with the
                            President that it would be unrealistic to plan on $38 billion in Defense
                            appropriations every year. In Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>’s view, military expenditures should be
                            gradually reduced. The longer these expenditures were kept at a high
                            level, the sharper would be the reduction when it occurred. The
                            reduction would inevitably come, because the present tax burden could
                            not be continued much longer. A sudden reduction in military
                            expenditures would be economically and militarily disastrous. Therefore,
                            we should plan for annual reductions downward from the $38 billion
                            ceiling. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>
                            thought there would be a public demand for redeployment of our forces
                            and for greater “productivity” in the armed forces—that is, a better
                            defense job for less money. He felt it would be possible to reduce
                            expenditures without reducing our military power.</p>
                        <p>The President said he agreed with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>’s remarks over the long run, but felt that
                            these remarks ignored certain factors. It would not be possible for the
                            United States to reduce military expenditures to the level desired by
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> unless and
                            until we achieved a safeguarded disarmament agreement. We must convince
                            the world that we are strong and will remain strong, in order to get
                            such a disarmament agreement; and if we don’t get it, we will live out
                            our lives, and our children will live out their lives, under the
                            greatest tension, and perhaps we will even suffer an attack.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said it was
                            necessary to eliminate obsolete equipment more rapidly as modem
                            equipment was developed.</p>
                        <p>The President said he would miss Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, and that the Council would miss Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>’s speech at every
                            meeting.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he realized
                            that U.S. foreign and military policies were intertwined. He wondered
                            what the Secretary of State would propose in lieu of redeployment of
                            U.S. forces if he was not prepared to agree to redeployment. Referring
                            to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>’s remarks,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he did not
                            go along with the idea that the American public would demand continuous
                            reductions in defense expenditures. He felt he could do a good job with
                            $38 billion, although he would need some help from the Department of
                            State as far as <pb xml:id="pg_563" n="563" facs="0587"/>redeployment
                            was concerned. He pointed out that if defense expenditures could be
                            levelled off at $38 billion a year for a number of years, then as the
                            country’s prosperity grew the defense percentage of Government
                            expenditures would decline. He said some of his subordinates had
                            suggested that the President should make clear the fact that we were
                            operating under a ceiling on defense expenditures. The President said he
                            had already made the ceiling clear and would do so again if
                            necessary.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said many people
                            do not realize the great changes that have taken place in weapons and
                            military concepts in recent years, and he felt these changes should also
                            be made clear to the public.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> then wondered how
                            he should go about presenting his <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959
                            program to Congress, and how soon he could disclose to his associates in
                            the Pentagon the objective of the $38 billion ceiling and a force level
                            of 2.5 million men. The President replied that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> must work these things out
                            himself. He said he assumed that the figures presented at the meeting
                            were planning figures, and that the actual figures should develop
                            naturally. He felt, however, that it would be inappropriate to issue
                            great directives.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959 plan was not too controversial,
                            although he would have to take up with the Army the handling of overseas
                            deployment in a way satisfactory to the State Department. Perhaps he
                            should use the figure of $38 billion for planning and the figure of 2.6
                            million men for personnel in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959, and
                            then adjust the personnel figure up or down as necessary. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> felt that if his plan
                            for 2.5 million men in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1961 leaked
                            out, Congress might ask that personnel be reduced to this figure
                            immediately.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> suggested that
                            one way to make a saving would be to put all government ordnance plants,
                            etc., in the United States on a 4-day week. The President said that was
                            one way to make a saving. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he would talk to the President about this
                            again.</p>
                        <p>The President said he did not think it was profitable to talk widely
                            about U.S. military programs for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1960
                            and <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1961. He thought plans for these
                            years should not be put down on paper, although they would, of course,
                            continue to be discussed at the top level in Defense.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that
                            anyone who thought he could not live within his budget should speak out
                            now, because the Treasury balance was so low that if expenditures for
                            the first half of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 exceed
                            allocations, a special session of Congress will be necessary about
                            Thanksgiving. The President agreed that the Government agencies must
                            keep within their allocations in order to avoid exceeding the debt
                            ceiling, and added that a special session of Congress would be quite a
                            Thanksgiving present.</p>

                                President withdrew from the final text of the Record of Actions
                                language in the preliminary draft that had referred to his warning
                                in the Council meeting that the Congress and the people might not
                                continue in the future to support a $38 billion annual expenditure
                                level for military functions and military construction. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> added:<p>“At the same time he

                                <p>“He also instructed me to say to you that in your planning for
                                    future years you should keep in mind the role of the Army,
                                    particularly in ‘cold war’.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>)</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>(1) Stated that, if the United States is not able on a continuous basis
                            to convince the world and particularly the Soviet Union that we are
                            strong and will remain so, we are not likely to obtain a safeguarded
                            disarmament arrangement, in which case the next generation would
                            continue to live in a state of world tension and might even suffer an
                            attack.</p>
                        <p>(2) Emphasized that the most economical and effective military
                            organization is one which is continuously developing and advancing on a
                            stable basis over an extended period of time.</p>
                        <p>(3) Directed the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense to
                            consider jointly the foreign policy implications involved in the U.S.
                            military program for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959 while in the
                            planning stage and prior to final approval, and involved in possible
                            trends for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1960 and <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1961 as outlined in the presentation by
                            the Secretary of Defense.</p>
                        <p>(4) Assuming no unforeseen critical emergency or major change of an
                            international or economic character:</p>
                        <p>(a) Would personally give full support for the next several years for an
                            annual expenditure level for military functions and military
                            construction of approximately $38 billion, and would expect Defense
                            Department officials to do the same.</p>
                        <p>(b) Approved the U.S. military program for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958, subject to final detailed staffing within the
                            Department of Defense, within the following limits:</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_565" n="565" facs="0589"/>
                        <p>(1) Expenditure level for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 for
                            military functions and military construction totaling $38 billion.
                            Reaffirmed his directive that Defense Department expenditures for
                            military functions and military construction during the first half of
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 must be kept within $19
                            billion, in order to avoid exceeding the current debt limit.</p>
                        <p>(ii) Personnel strength of all military services at mid-<gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 of 2.7 million, with such further
                            reduction by the end of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 as
                            required to keep within the above expenditure level (but not below
                            approximately 2.6 million) as may be decided in connection with the
                            formulation of the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959 budget.</p>
                        <p>(c) Authorized the Secretary of Defense to continue planning and
                            preparation of initial <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959 budget
                            submissions along the general lines of the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959 program as proposed by him, including expenditures
                            and new obligational authority for military functions and military
                            construction of $38 billion.</p>
                        <p>(d) Stated that military personnel, units or funds for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1960 and <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1961 should not now be finalized; but that planning
                            beyond <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959, to the extent necessary
                            in connection with the preparation of the 1959 budget, should be on the
                            basis of annual expenditures and new obligational authority of
                            approximately $38 billion and should recognize the trend toward more
                            expensive military equipment with some reductions in personnel.</p>

                                above, reads as follows:<p>‘For planning purposes the mobilization
                                    base is defined as the total of all resources available, or
                                    which can be made available, to meet foreseeable wartime
                                    needs.</p>
                                <p>“Such resources include the manpower and material resources and

                                    civilian, and survival activities; as well as the elements

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> felt that the
                            illustrations in the second paragraph of the definition were restrictive
                            and subject to change from year to year. Since U.S. policy with respect
                            to the mobilization base was already set forth in the Basic National
                            Security Policy (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5707/8), he felt it
                            was unnecessary to add illustrative material to the definition.<note n="5" xml:id="d134fn5">A footnote to the definition proposed by the
                                    <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning Board reads: “The
                                Bureau of the Budget agrees with only the first paragraph of the
                                above definition.”</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> pointed out that the
                            proposed definition contained a new element which had never before
                            appeared in a definition of the mobilization base—namely, the services
                            required for survival activities. He said this element appeared in the
                            illustrative material in the second paragraph of the definition. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> said that some other
                            new element might be thought of next year.</p>
                        <p>The President said perhaps we will think of something new next year. He
                            felt the concept of survival must be an essential part of the definition
                            of the mobilization base. He pointed out that global war could be
                            divided into two stages: first, survival of the initial blows, and
                            second, going on to win the war.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> asked whether Budget
                            would object if the illustrative material were placed in a footnote. The
                            President said the illustrations in the second paragraph of the proposed
                            definition were valuable. The elements affecting the state of readiness
                            of essential military, civilian and survival activities must include
                            everything. It seemed to the President that the Planning Board’s
                            proposed definition was satisfactory as it was.</p>

                        <p>The President also thought this was a good approach. He said if we
                            attempted to inform the public on the human effects of nuclear weapons
                            by dramatic actions, we would create hysteria instead of spreading
                            information. Working through the Foreign Policy Association and the
                            American Assembly was a sound method. He favored the gradual approach.
                            He wondered whether we had sounded out the Foreign Policy Association
                            and the American Assembly. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> reported that <gloss target="#t_FCDA1">FCDA</gloss> had already been in touch with these
                            organizations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out that there
                            was a difference of opinion in the Planning Board as to the appropriate
                            official to make the initial contacts with the Foreign Policy
                            Association, the American Assembly, and other organizations. The
                            President said this was a job for <gloss target="#t_FCDA1">FCDA</gloss>
                            in the long run. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> said
                            that many of the topics listed for group discussion fell in the State
                            Department’s field, and suggested that the Secretary of State might be
                            asked to collaborate with the Federal Civil Defense Administration in
                            making the necessary contacts. The President and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> agreed with this suggestion.</p>

                        <p>(1) In lieu of earlier recommendations for joint governmental-private
                            sponsorship of such group discussions (reference memorandum of January
                            29, 1957), efforts should be made to stimulate such group discussions
                            under private auspices.</p>
                        <p>(2) A gradual, developmental approach should be favored over a dramatic,
                            nationwide approach.</p>
                        <p>(3) The Foreign Policy Association, the American Assembly, and other
                            appropriate organizations should be encouraged to take the lead in the
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>(4) The Federal Government should not be responsible for developing
                            materials to facilitate the group discussions referred to in (1) above,
                            but the cognizant agencies of the Federal Government <pb xml:id="pg_569" n="569" facs="0593"/>should continue to make available, as part of
                            normal information material, unclassified information designed to
                            facilitate such group discussions.</p>

                            the presentation, were scheduled to be phased out).<note n="14" xml:id="d134fn14">See <ref target="#d138">Document 138</ref>.</note>
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> invited attention to
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action No 1484–c and the
                            President’s directive issued in lieu of approval of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action No. 1484–d (December 21, 1955).
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then called upon
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> read a memorandum
                            addressed to the President under date of July 31, 1957 (copy<note n="15" xml:id="d134fn15">The memorandum is filed in the minutes, and is
                                also quoted in full below.</note> filed in the minutes of the
                            meeting), as follows:</p>
                        <p>“The present dual approach to the <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>
                            development program with its resultant excessive cost is no longer
                            justified. I recommend that the Thor and Jupiter development programs be
                            combined into a single missile program.</p>
                        <p>“I propose to establish a committee composed of three members, one each
                            from the Department of Defense, the Air Force and the Army to consider
                            both the Jupiter and Thor programs with the purpose of properly
                            evaluating the engineering and scientific information provided by the
                            work to date. This committee will be asked to recommend <pb xml:id="pg_570" n="570" facs="0594"/>a final program which, when
                            adopted, will be under the management of the Air Force. The advisability
                            of a new name for the program will be considered at that time.</p>
                        <p>“I propose in the meantime to suspend or cancel the production of
                            additional missiles and missile components beyond those necessary for a
                            continuing test program. I further propose that overtime be eliminated
                            except that necessary in conjunction with flight testing and for the
                            small amount necessary to take care of emergencies. This applies to both
                            contractors’ operations as well as those under our supervision.</p>
                        <p>“I conceive the new program as costing substantially less than the
                            present dual approach.</p>
                        <p>“These changes may cause some delay in the program. While this cannot be
                            definitely evaluated at this time, I believe it will not be great enough
                            to be important in the light of the time it will take to work out
                            operational use and deployment of the perfected missile.</p>
                        <p>“In respect to the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> programs, I
                            propose to continue the Atlas at the highest priority. We are
                            re-examining the facilities and schedules for experimental production,
                            including a careful study of the overtime problem, to see if acceptable
                            economies can be made.</p>
                        <p>“In respect to the Titan program, I believe that by reducing the
                            pressures on this program we can make substantial economies in this
                            alternative development.</p>
                        <p>“I would like to make it clear that the actions we are proposing at this
                            time might be considered to depart from the directions that we received
                            as a result of National Security Council Action 1433 on 8 September 1955
                            under which we were instructed to pursue these programs at highest
                            priority and to explore promising alternative avenues of development. I
                            should therefore like your approval for this proposed course of
                            action.”</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> asked that the
                            President approve the recommendations in this letter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out that the
                            President had previously laid great stress on developing guided missiles
                            rapidly for their psychological effect. The President asked whether
                            Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> and Mr.
                            Holaday agreed with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s recommendations, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> replied in the affirmative.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (8 lines of source text) not
                                declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> wondered how long the
                            committee referred to in Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s letter would require for its deliberations.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he didn’t
                            know.</p>
                        <p>The President asked why Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> wished to put the single missile program, which
                            would result from a combination of the Thor and Jupiter programs, under
                            the management of the Air Force. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that the Air Force was responsible in
                            accordance with its roles and missions, and that originally Jupiter had
                            been put under the Army because of its Redstone experience. The
                            President said that when he had agreed to the dual approach, he had also
                            agreed that the force developing the missile need not be the one to
                            utilize it. He <pb xml:id="pg_571" n="571" facs="0595"/>still wondered
                            why there should be an advance decision that the Air Force would manage
                            the single missile program. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said the Air Force would be responsible for
                            installation and operational use, and that the Air Force had sufficient
                            money in its 1958 budget, whereas the Army did not. The President said
                            he wasn’t objecting too strongly to Air Force management, but he
                            wondered what would happen to morale if a group of technicians in a
                            service worked for a long time on a missile and then had it taken away
                            from them. He thought Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> had adopted the correct approach in general, but
                            still wondered about this advance decision on management by the Air
                            Force.</p>
                        <p>The President added that the part of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s letter dealing with canceling
                            the production of missile components beyond those necessary for a
                            continuing test program, made him smile, because he had suggested this
                            some time ago. He had made the point that we should not approve
                            components of production models unless we were sure the missiles would
                            work. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that
                            the United States had a “mess” of Jupiter and Thor missiles. The
                            President said these missiles wouldn’t be a mess if they worked.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said we had a
                            missile that went 1500 miles, but it had no guidance and the re-entry
                            problem was not solved. He said we had two versions of an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>, one a year behind the other. We were
                            replacing the first before we were sure it would work. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> thought that if Atlas
                            did not work, neither would Titan. The President said he agreed with
                            what Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> was
                            proposing.</p>
                        <p>With reference to overtime, the President thought the real bottleneck in
                            missile programs was not overtime, but thinking out the problems. Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> said that he had no evidence of anything
                            new or dramatic in the Soviet missiles program. The President said he
                            thought Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s plan
                            was satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> said he understood that
                            Atlas was continued at the highest priority, and that the priority of
                            Titan was reduced. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> asked whether Admiral Strauss agreed with the
                            recommendations in his letter, and Admiral Strauss replied in the
                            affirmative.</p>

                            such delay is not expected to be significant in the light of the time

                        <p>1. This morning I made two telephone calls to the Defense Department,

                        <pb xml:id="pg_573" n="573" facs="0597"/>
                        <p>Last week Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> had a press
                            conference in which he spoke very facetiously about an alleged Army
                            intention of building an 800 mile ballistic missile. He spoke about it
                            in terms implying strong disapproval, and he also implied that the Army
                            had undoubtedly acted without any authority from the Secretary of
                            Defense.</p>
                        <p>A memorandum to me from the Army<note n="3" xml:id="d135fn3">Not found in
                                the Eisenhower Library.</note> states that the proposition that was
                            mentioned was incorrectly described in the question addressed to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>. On top of this, the
                            Army has done nothing whatsoever in extending the range of the
                            particular missile in question (I believe it is the Redpath)<note n="4" xml:id="d135fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> presumably is
                                referring to Redstone.</note> but requested authority to introduce a
                            solid propellant which it is alleged would give the missile an effective
                            range of 400 to 500 miles (not 800 as alleged in the question directed
                            to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>). The Army also
                            states that its plan would be to use this weapon to get greater
                            flexibility, but dependent completely upon the Air Force for
                            reconnaissance necessary to report targets and results of findings.</p>
                        <p>Actually the whole proposition seems sensible to me, particularly in that
                            development costs would be limited to modification for the change in
                            fuel.</p>
                        <p>I suggested that the Chief of Staff seek an appointment at once with the
                            Secretary of Defense, telling the Secretary that he was doing so at my
                            instruction.</p>
                        <p>I am disturbed by the implication left in the newspaper stories that the
                            Departments are operating in defiance of the Secretary of Defense’s
                            orders when, as a matter of fact, it appears to me that the Army did
                            everything possible to keep this matter strictly within the limits of
                            regular and proper procedure.</p>
                        <p>A copy of the Army memorandum is filed with this account.</p>
                        <p>2. My second call was to General White of the Air Force. A newspaper
                            story states that in a recent public speech, he made comparisons between
                            the Air Force and its sister services in the matter of their readiness
                            to appreciate modern conditions and adapt their methods and equipment to
                            those conditions.</p>
                        <p>I told him that I had no objection to his praising his own service as
                            much as he pleased, but I did object to any representative of one of the
                            services comparing himself or his own service with the others to their
                            disadvantage and his own advantage. This in my opinion is destructive in
                            terms of the whole general service morale.</p>
                        <p>It is the old question of whether service men are working first of all
                            for their own service or for the good of the United States.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_574" n="574" facs="0598"/>
                        <p>General White agreed that this had been an error, but stated that the
                            document had been submitted to the Secretary of Defense before delivery
                            as a public speech. He said also that he called specific attention to
                            the paragraph that aroused my concern, and that the speech was approved
                            by the Defense Department without comment. I suggested to him that
                            hereafter if he had any doubt about any feelings that might be hurt, he
                            consult with the Chiefs of Staff rather than with the Defense Department
                            staff whose concern for such remarks might not be so acute.</p>

                        <p>I have noted the divergent views of the Chiefs of Staff of the Army and
                            Air Force and of the Chief of Naval Operations, together with a
                            memorandum by the Commandant of the Marine Corps, on this subject. These
                            reports, together with the comments by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
                            of Staff, have been carefully considered.<note n="5" xml:id="d136fn5">These reports and comments, which may have been attached to

                        </p>
                        <p>All addressees heard the presentation which was made before the National
                            Security Council on July 25th,<note n="7" xml:id="d136fn7">See <ref target="#d133">Document 133</ref>.</note> and had an opportunity
                            to comment. I realize from the comments that divergencies of views exist
                            in connection with the necessary military planning for the succeeding
                            three fiscal years. I further recognize that at least some of these
                            differences of opinion stem from the fact that the United States has
                            certain commitments for deployments which individual Services are not in
                            a position to reduce.</p>
                        <p>The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Chairman designate have
                            reported that they feel that no further effective detailed military
                            planning can be accomplished by the Joint Chiefs of Staff until the
                            Military Departments have made further separate studies of the problems
                            involved along the lines of the presentation made to the National
                            Security Council. At the same time it is essential that further
                            examination by the responsible civilian and military officials be made
                            in line with reference (b). This is necessary as a basis for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 59 budget planning and for further
                            discussions with the Secretary of State.</p>
                        <p>As indicated in the presentation to the National Security Council, I
                            concur generally in the comments of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff as expressed in reference (a), except as may be noted in
                            succeeding paragraphs. By attendance at the National Security Council
                            meeting of July 25th, the addressees have had the benefit of the
                            President’s thinking as well as of the other members of the National
                            Security Council in regard to the presentation made and the broad trends
                            necessary in our military planning, including the budget limitations
                            that exist.</p>
                        <p>We now know that the new obligational authority appropriated by the
                            Congress for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 58 will be approximately
                            $36 billion. The expenditure ceiling of $38 billion for the Department
                            of Defense for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 58 has now been
                            re-affirmed and the amounts within this ceiling for each of the three
                            Military Departments have been determined as set forth in reference (c).
                            This establishes a factual basis for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            58 on which we can project the planning for succeeding years.</p>

                        <p>To maintain a balanced military program we should continue the
                            modernization of our forces. Consideration of the increased cost of
                            military equipment and the actions necessary under a level expenditure
                            policy indicate that some further reductions in personnel strengths of
                            the military services will be required in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 60 and <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 61.</p>
                        <p>Adhering to the approved strategic concept and considering the power of
                            modern weapons, it is apparent that active forces and reserve forces
                            which would be immediately available subsequent to D-day are the only
                            forces which would contribute appreciably to U.S. security in the
                            initial phases of general war. While the forces must be designed
                            primarily for deterring, and, if necessary, fighting a general war, I
                            believe they contain within them the essential forces needed to cope
                            with situations short of general war. Very little procurement for
                            mobilization <pb xml:id="pg_577" n="577" facs="0601"/>reserves should be
                            contemplated in the future and a shrinking of the present industrial
                            reserve mobilization structure will be necessary.</p>
                        <p>With consideration for the rapidly increasing costs of new weapons, it is
                            apparent that under a level expenditure policy a decision must be made
                            now as between keeping our forces modern or holding the number of
                            military personnel and units at a numerically high level. Under the
                            conditions of modern warfare, it is generally agreed military thinking
                            that it is vital to modernize our equipment and maintain our military
                            units in a high state of readiness rather than to hold numbers of
                            personnel and units at a high level.</p>
                        <p>From the above it is apparent that the number of personnel in active
                            Reserve units, including the National Guard, should be gradually reduced
                            during the time period under consideration. For planning purposes I
                            would like to have you consider a reduction of approximately 10% in
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 59 and further reductions of
                            approximately 5% annually in the following two years.</p>
                        <p>I would like to have the Service Secretaries, with the assistance of the
                            Service Chiefs, conduct in their own offices detailed studies of our
                            military programs for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 59, including
                            personnel figures for the beginning as well as the end of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 59, and for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 60 and <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 61, to the
                            extent required in connection with the preparation of the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 59 budget. These studies should be
                            submitted to me by September 3, 1957.<note n="13" xml:id="d136fn13">Memoranda from <persName corresp="#p_BWM1">Brucker</persName> to

                        <p>The Service Secretaries should establish a small planning group in their

                        <p>1. The continuing importance to the United States of an ability
                            effectively to deal with limited war is an issue which has constantly
                            recurred in the Planning Board. Usually it has been raised by the <pb xml:id="pg_579" n="579" facs="0603"/>civilian Planning Board members
                            of non-military Departments, such as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> of State or Professor Elliott of <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss>. Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> of Defense has also shown
                            concern.</p>
                        <p>2. Just recently I received interesting personal memoranda from two <hi rend="italic">military</hi> representatives at the Planning Board
                            table: Lt. <persName corresp="#p_FMGFW1">General Farrell</persName> (the
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> Adviser) and Captain Morse,
                                <gloss target="#t_USN1">USN</gloss> (the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> Observer). These memoranda, coming from military men of
                            demonstrated ability again focused attention on this issue of limited
                            versus all-out war. I attach these memoranda (in abridged form):<note n="2" xml:id="d137fn2">Neither printed; the unabridged versions have
                                not been found in the Eisenhower Library or Department of State
                                files.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>a. <persName corresp="#p_FMGFW1">General Farrell</persName>’s thesis is
                            that predominant reliance on increased firepower, essential as this
                            element is, tends to obscure the need for other elements in conducting
                            hostilities.</p>
                        <p>b. Captain Morse points to the effect upon the Soviets, and especially
                            upon our Allies, of our becoming more and more the possessors of a vast
                            deterrent power which we may be less and less inclined to use.</p>
                        <p>3. The issue of how best to deal with limited hostilities is a continuing
                            one, to which an exact answer is difficult. In times of international
                            tension and financial strain, the necessity for enhanced capabilities to
                            deter global war takes priority. Nevertheless, many of us working on
                            policy issues feel that continuing attention should also be given to the
                            U.S. capability to deal with hostilities short of general war. The
                            importance of this capability is recognized in our existing basic
                            national security policy.</p>
                        <p>4. My suggestion is that some way be found to elevate in the highest
                            councils the need for such continuing attention, without calling for
                            increased financial expenditures. There may be many ways to bring about
                            this elevation of attention.</p>
                        <p>5. One way might be for the President to constitute a top level Council
                            Committee and give to it terms of reference so that this issue would
                            receive continuing attention and not be brushed aside in the years
                            ahead. Such a Committee might consist of two representatives from State,
                            two representatives from Defense, and one from <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, with an eminent retired officer as Chairman and with
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName>—in his new function at
                            the Harvard Center for International Affairs—as a member or a
                            consultant. One course which such a Committee might pursue would be
                            periodically to present studies of existing U.S. capability effectively
                            to deal with assumed local hostilities starting in <pb xml:id="pg_580" n="580" facs="0604"/>trouble spots (such as Korea, the Offshore
                            Islands, Syria, Indonesia, Indo-China, Thailand, Israel, etc.).<note n="3" xml:id="d137fn3">In a memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>, dated August 9, Frederick M. Dearborn, Jr.,
                                commented in part as follows: “Although I do not have much official
                                background on this subject, I have been disturbed ever since Dien
                                Bien Phu about the effect of the deterrent policy on our capability
                                for limited war.” He noted that he did not agree with <persName corresp="#p_FMGFW1">General Farrell</persName> and Captain Morse
                                in detail but, “I thoroughly agree to the need for further
                                examination of the problem.” Dearborn went on to provide specific
                                examples of the kind of contingency study he would like to see
                                undertaken. (Eisenhower Library, Sp. Asst. for Nat. Sec. Affairs

                        <p>DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: In response to your letter of 8 July,<note n="2" xml:id="d138fn2">In this letter to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, the President congratulated
                                the Department of Defense on its “superior and most informative”
                                presentation on missile programs to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> on July 3, and he asked <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> to give him his recommendations not later
                                than August 15 on any additional missile programs which could be
                                eliminated before October 15. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi> )</note>
                            we have again assessed each project in our current guided missile
                            program. This reassessment has confirmed the remarks I made at the 3
                            July presentation<note n="3" xml:id="d138fn3">See <ref target="#d126">Document 126</ref>.</note> to the effect that this program can
                            and must be reduced to meet budget limitations. In fact, as you will
                            remember, we indicated we were critically reviewing the Navaho system.
                            On 8 July, the Air Force recommended the cancellation of this program
                            and I approved this recommendation the following day. This action will
                            reduce the cost projections of the missile programs as presented to you
                            by $1,948 million for the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958–<gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963 time period and will have an
                            undetermined effect on <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958
                            expenditures. Except for the Navaho, in view of the complex
                            inter-relationship between projected missile <pb xml:id="pg_581" n="581" facs="0605"/>force structures and those of other weapons systems, I
                            cannot, at this time, give you more than an indication of the areas
                            wherein other reductions will be made.</p>
                        <p>The first of these refers to the apparent overlapping of the Nike and
                            Talos programs that you indicated in your 8 July letter. I wish to
                            assure you that these programs were very critically reviewed before I
                            authorized the Army to go ahead with the addition of a land-based Talos
                            program for modernization of the Nike systems. We were convinced at the
                            time that a combination of these two systems would ultimately result in
                            a more effective air defense than the same dollars could buy of either
                            system alone. In our presentation to you, since the rate of build-up has
                            not yet been specifically defined for either the land-based Talos or the
                            Nike–Hercules, we showed these two programs in an additive way. It is my
                            intention that this Talos program will be balanced by a commensurate
                            reduction in the Nike-Hercules program. For this reason, the over-all
                            totals presented to you can be reduced by the $701 million planned for
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963 for the Talos. Moreover, I fully
                            expect that the finally approved Nike-Hercules-Talos total force based
                            on recommendations of the Joint Chiefs of Staff will be substantially
                            less than the total force now projected for Nike-Hercules alone. In the
                            final analysis it is still possible that the Army version of the Talos
                            might be dropped.</p>
                        <p>The reductions resulting in the Navaho and Nike-Talos systems which can
                            be specifically defined at this time are shown in the following

                        <p>Regarding the other examples referred to in your letter of 8 July, the
                            following remarks are pertinent:</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_582" n="582" facs="0606"/>
                        <p>(a) Jupiter–Thor—Steps are under way to consolidate these projects into a
                            national land-based <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> program. The
                            mechanism for accomplishing this was given in my letter of 31 July
                                1957.<note n="4" xml:id="d138fn4">Not found in the Eisenhower
                                Library or Department of State files, but quoted under agenda item
                                10 in <ref target="#d134">Document 134</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>(b) Atlas–Titan—This was also reported in my letter of 31 July 1957.</p>
                        <p>(c) Terrier–Tartar—The Navy requirement for these two missiles stems from
                            the need for an air defense capability to replace 5-inch guns on ships
                            with limited storage space. Both missiles are produced By the same
                            manufacturer, with about 70% interchangeability in components. This is
                            essentially one program. The Tartar operates without the separate
                            Terrier booster, which reduces its operational capability. Space
                            problems aboard ship make this necessary.</p>
                        <p>(d) Polaris–Triton—Discussions are under way with the Navy which may
                            result in the phasing out of either Regulus II or Triton; a possible
                            alternative would be [to] reduce the presently planned scopes of these
                            programs to carry them both forward within the cost projected for
                            Regulus II alone. Development of the Polaris missile will be carried on
                            with a high defense priority. As pointed out in our presentation of 3
                            July 1957, this missile will provide many logistic and strategic
                            advantages. In addition to its use on submarines we are giving serious
                            consideration to its use as a land-based <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> with a range of from 300 to 1500 miles. If this
                            development is successful, it might at least in part supersede the
                            Thor–Jupiter <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> and should then be
                            picked up by the Air Force for their mission.</p>
                        <p>Although we do not now anticipate further missile eliminations before 1
                            October 1957, a second area for possible reduction lies in a detailed
                            review which I have instituted to determine to what extent certain
                            missile force projections can or should be reduced.</p>
                        <p>Since the bulk of the projected funding needs are directly related to
                            force requirements, I am reviewing the missile force projections,
                            particularly as they are affected by related aircraft and ordnance
                            weapons systems, as a part of my review of the over-all military force
                            projection. In this manner the missile program adjustments will be kept
                            consistent with the adjustments of related aircraft and ordnance
                            programs.</p>

                        <p>As was stressed in our presentation to you on 3 July 1957, certain
                            programs will be phased out during the development cycle; others will
                            not be carried into operational use; and in other programs there will be
                            a general scaling down of force requirements when confronted with a
                            realistic appraisal of the resources available and the complementary
                            weapons systems already existent. We expect to have certain actions
                            completed in time to effect expenditures during <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 and to provide for a sound <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959 budget and to continue our efforts to bring the
                            program into proper balance thereafter.</p>
                        <p>I assure you, Mr. President, that your aims are fully appreciated and
                            that the effort to attain them will be prosecuted on an urgent basis. I

                            idea worthwhile for flexibility and economy. He was concerned, however,
                            as to the value of improving the Redstone.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion:</p>
                        <p>The discussion that followed centered on the following matters:</p>
                        <p>(1) Weight and practicability of the Redstone. Technical problems
                            involved, such as propellants.</p>
                        <p>(2) Roles and missions allocations of 1956.</p>
                        <p>(3) Cost of Redstone improvement.</p>
                        <p>(4) Emphasis placed on tactical support by the Air Force.</p>
                        <p>(5) Relative accuracy of Redstone vs. <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>(6) Wisdom of the concept of “time of greatest danger.”</p>
                        <p>Generally the positions taken by those present at the conference were as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>(1) Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>—There is some
                            question as to the value of a 500-mile missile to the Army mission.
                            However, working on the basis that the value be recognized, the Redstone
                            has the following serious defects:</p>
                        <p>a. Heavy and bulky</p>
                        <p>b. Poor propellant</p>
                        <p>c. Cost, $80 million for the Redstone project</p>
                        <p>d. Availability and cost of warheads, the smaller, the more
                            expensive.</p>
                        <p>In view of the above, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s recommendation is the development of a solid
                            propellant missile to deliver a 1500-pound warhead 200 miles, with a
                            view to utilization of a 600-pound warhead, when such a warhead becomes
                            available, which will permit a range of 500 miles.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_585" n="585" facs="0609"/>
                        <p>(2) Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BWM1">Brucker</persName> and General
                            Lemnitzer—The Army feels definite need for a missile of the 500-mile
                            range, not so much to reach out into the enemy territory as to provide
                            security for the missile itself by placing it well to the rear to fire
                            in support of front line troops. As to the improvements of the Redstone
                            itself, the Army representatives had this to say:</p>
                        <p>a. The Redstone is not so awkward as is pictured. When fully loaded it
                            weighs 57,000 pounds but it does not weigh that much in a mobile
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>b. The Russians are developing a 500-mile missile which will give them a
                            capability not possessed by the United States.</p>
                        <p>c. The project at hand will require no new breakthroughs for development
                            but rather a modification of a remodified item back to its essentially
                            original form.</p>
                        <p>d. Costs by Army estimates will amount to $50 million rather than the $80
                            million estimated by the Secretary of Defense. (The apparent conclusion
                            to this discrepancy is that the Army figures do not include procurement
                            whereas the Defense figures include both procurement and <gloss target="#t_RandD1">R &amp; D</gloss>.)</p>
                        <p>e. No additional missiles above the currently planned number will be
                            requested. In other words, the total number of Redstones plus modified
                            Redstones will not exceed the number of currently planned Redstones.</p>
                        <p>(3) <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName>’s position.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName>’s comments
                            centered principally around the roles and missions decision. He pointed
                            out that the decision to limit the Army to 200-mile missiles was made
                            initially by General White and General Bolte,<note n="3" xml:id="d139fn3">Lieutenant General Charles L. Boité, Vice Chief of
                                Staff, U.S. Army, 1953–1955.</note> and that the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff consider that this is still the official limitation. He states
                            that the Air Force does not like to use the Redstone. He further states
                            that if the Army develops a missile over the 200-mile range by present
                            rules that missile will be taken over by the Air Force. <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> points out that the
                            current <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> with a minimum range of
                            300-miles can be so placed as to eradicate any possible gaps in the
                            range spectrum.</p>
                        <p>(4) Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> pointed out
                            that the 1500-pound warhead is currently programmed for the <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>(5) The President enunciated his views on several of these points:</p>
                        <p>a. He re-emphasized several times the unwisdom of taking a rigid view of
                            missile ranges and of roles and missions of services.</p>
                        <p>b. He pointed out the real morale problem inherent in a service which
                            feels that its talents are not being used to the utmost.</p>
                        <p>c. He expressed concern over the patchwork nature of the proposed
                            Redstone program.</p>
                        <p>d. He pointed out the problem of the commander on the ground as regards
                            the sometimes low priority given in tactical support by the Air Force.
                            He further pointed out that current Air Force programs tend <pb xml:id="pg_586" n="586" facs="0610"/>to take their cuts in tactical
                            rather than strategic air. This fact is accentuated by the differences
                            in the nature of the targets desired hit by the Army and Air Force. He
                            stressed his disapproval of the concept of the “time of greatest
                            danger,” adding that it had been a concept for several years. He pointed
                            out that any building toward a peak would result in an uneven financing.
                            He desires to achieve an evenness of financing as much as possible.
                            (This was brought out in connection with the fact that Polaris would not
                            be available as an Army substitute until after 1963.)</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Decision:</p>
                        <p>The President’s final decision is as follows:</p>
                        <p>(1) The detailed planning and evaluation of all missile programs, such as
                            the program tor the improvement of the Redstone, tall within the
                            responsibilities of the Department of Defense.</p>
                        <p>(2) No service should feel that it is restricted within a rigid range
                            ceiling. Specifically, the Army should not be denied a 500-mile missile
                            on the mere basis that the missile possesses a range capability of over
                            200 miles.</p>

                            pointing out that the figures for the first half must not exceed half of
                            those shown on the memorandum. He pointed out that the Budget Director
                            had estimated slightly higher but that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> had instructed him to keep expenditures within
                            these limits.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_587" n="587" facs="0611"/>
                        <p>The President stressed that the only way to get into an area where we
                            have a strong position with the Congress as regards budgets is to
                            eliminate soft estimates. By the time the budget is down to the point
                            where further cuts would be truly injurious, we can fight for our
                            estimates.</p>
                        <p>The difficulty, in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s
                            view of the procedures thus far, is that we have attempted to go on a
                            “requirement of services” basis and settle it down as the early
                            expenditure goes on. We sometimes have a poor shopping list and at the
                            end of the year some monies are not expended. When Congress discovers
                            these unexpected items, it chops on the following year. Expenditure is
                            of course a separate matter from obligational authority. The President
                            stated that before very long the backlog of unexpected monies will be
                            eaten; therefore, expenditures and <gloss target="#t_NOA1">NOA</gloss>
                            will be the same.</p>
                        <p>In that connection, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>
                            pointed out that fiscal year 1959 should wash out that backlog. The Army
                            previously had some unexpected funds which were used for make-up for
                            other services. The division of monies for 1959 will be the same as
                            those brought forth in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting
                            of 25 July.<note n="3" xml:id="d140fn3">See <ref target="#d133">Document
                                    133</ref>.</note> The figures as shown for 1960–61 will be used,
                            but more flexibility for planning will be allowed than was brought out
                            at that meeting. In this connection, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> has required force levels from the services by
                            September 10.</p>
                        <p>Discussion then lapsed into an analogy between the defense expenditure
                            problem and that of mutual aid, with emphasis on the soft estimates. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> in this connection
                            pointed out that on the foreign aid we will have to take a completely
                            new look at what we will receive, what our requirements are, and what
                            our allocations must be. The President mentioned parenthetically that he
                            does not know how we will be able to get by with $620 million of defense
                            support.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> then expressed the
                            opinion that he can see where we can save $150 million of mutual aid. Of
                            course, this will involve by necessity President Rhee’s losing four
                            divisions in Korea. The complication in this problem, according to the
                            President, is that President Rhee is completely capable of cutting his
                            forces entirely to the point where they are able only to maintain
                            internal security and decide to abolish any idea of holding the front
                            line.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Missiles</p>
                        <p>The committee for consolidation of <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>
                            No. 1 and <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> No. 2 has been
                            appointed. There will be no more of each type of missile ordered beyond
                            a few for testing purposes. In this connection the President offered the
                            opinion that if we had the missile problem to face over again—that is,
                            if we were in the position we were five years <pb xml:id="pg_588" n="588" facs="0612"/>ago—that he would institute an agency similar
                            to the Manhattan District for missile development. The difficulty now is
                            that of morale. From the way it is being handled in the press, it will
                            appear that the Army and the Air Force are in a cat and dog fight over
                            possession of the missile, with the Air Force emerging winner. This we
                            know is not true since we are following plans which have been made of
                            long standing. He went on to point out that the new <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> will have as much of the Jupiter as
                            the Thor. He emphasized the current morale problem of ground troops,
                            again stating his conviction that ground troops at home will save this
                            country in the next war and expressed his consternation at the
                            reluctance of the Army to accept that as a role. He mentioned the pride
                            of discovery which the Army has developed concerning the Jupiter and
                            stressed it should not appear that we are deciding a great fight.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> expressed the opinion
                            that he was right in bringing the Army into the <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> field since the developments at Huntsville had gotten
                            quite far advanced. He agreed with the President that there will be at
                            least as much Jupiter as Thor in the final <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> was
                            initially conceived as a “fall-out” of the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>. (That is, the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                            would be a three-stage and the <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> a
                            two-stage rocket of the same design.) However, it did not turn out to be
                            that simple and the fall-out from the 175-mile Redstone also resulted in
                            an <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>. The difficulty was that the
                            group of German scientists located at Huntsville desired to get into
                            longer range missiles. The Army’s viewpoint was that these missiles were
                            really large mortars and that the Army was therefore going ahead and
                            operating these missile units, even though on a sub rosa basis. He
                            recognizes there is a large service morale problem which involves the
                            entire future ballistic missile mission. (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> further allowed that he had
                            previous experience with a bunch of inventors.)</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Army Missile Program</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> then brought up the
                            subject of the Army missile program which had been treated in the
                            discussion of August 12.<note n="4" xml:id="d140fn4">See the summary of
                                conference, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note> He expressed the
                            feeling that if we had sufficient money we should let the Army go ahead
                            with the modified Redstone. However, since the Redstone is becoming an
                            obsolete weapon, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said
                            he “tends to choke” on developing it further. He recommends that the
                            Army go ahead with a two-stage solid propellant missile, say
                            10,000–15,000 pounds, highly maneuverable. He states that it can be a
                            good missile for the 200-mile range and does not know whether it can be
                            boosted into the 500-mile range.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_589" n="589" facs="0613"/>
                        <p>Again the President reiterated his statement of 12 August that the
                            technical angles, which included cost and procurement, are not matters
                            for the President. However, he reemphasized his desire that the Army not
                            feel that it is forbidden to develop a good missile which has the
                            capability of firing 500 miles.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Redeployment</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> brought up the fact
                            that we still have not got all our combat troops out of Japan. One of
                            the problems is where to put them, one of the solutions, of course,
                            being to redeploy them home. His figures were that we can eventually
                            redeploy 8,000 out of Korea, 40,000 out of Japan and 35,000 out of
                            Europe, in view of the smaller divisions and the possible reductions in
                            size of headquarters. In this connection the President said you can
                            redeploy very easily so long as you don’t <hi rend="italic">talk</hi>
                            about it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> expressed
                            the opinion it would be difficult to keep this redeployment secret.
                            However, he had every intention of keeping it secret until 15 September,
                            the date of the German elections. The large trouble, in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s view, is President Rhee.</p>
                        <p>Proceeding further to the other services, he felt that he could redeploy
                            15,000 out of the Navy which will bring the total to about 100,000
                            redeployments from overseas. As to 1959, the plans there depend on what
                            we will work out this fall. In summary, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s opinion is that the services could go to a
                            figure of 2.5 million more and keep five divisions in Europe and two in
                            Korea. He states that he still has to “make his sale” with the Army, who
                            thinks they are one division short, Much apparently will come out of the
                            meeting on 5 September between the Department of Defense and Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>.<note n="5" xml:id="d140fn5">A memorandum of conversation of this meeting on

                            over the results of Mr. McElroy’s confirmation procedures before
                                Congress<note n="6" xml:id="d140fn6">President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> nominated Neil McElroy,
                                president of Procter and Gamble, as Secretary of Defense to succeed
                                    <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>.</note> and stated
                            that Dr. Foote’s would go up to the Senate today.<note n="7" xml:id="d140fn7">Dr. Paul D. Foote, retired vice president of Gulf

                                (Research and Engineering). When the Senate refused confirmation
                                because of possible “conflict of interest” problems stemming from
                                his refusal to give up his Gulf pension or oil stocks, <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> gave him a recess
                                appointment until Congress reconvened in January 1958.</note> Mr.
                            McElroy’s nomination had been reported out of committee unanimously
                            except for a remark which Senator Byrd placed in the <hi rend="italic">Record</hi>. The matter of concern to <pb xml:id="pg_590" n="590" facs="0614"/>Senator Byrd is that “conflict of interest,” and
                            involves a difference in viewpoint. The difference in viewpoint is that
                            the Secretary of Defense, by one view, is not a procurement officer. A
                            procurement officer’s is a technical job, and an old law requires that
                            the procurement officer should have no interest in the contracting
                            agencies. However, the three departments are separately administered,
                            and whereas the Department of Defense may reach down into the services
                            in exceptional cases, it is entirely possible for the Secretary of
                            Defense to stay away from a situation which might involve a conflict of
                            interest. With this last point Senate Byrd disagrees.</p>

                        <p>Disarmament was mentioned only briefly. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> expressed the hope that <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General Twining</persName> would take the same
                            interest as <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> has

                            deplored the press’ tendency to paint a picture of a conflict between

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Personal plans</p>
                        <p>Discussion then went to personal plans of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>. He plans to be off on leave in the next couple
                            of days, but will be ready to return at a moment’s notice. This is the
                            result of the current embarrassment caused by many high officials of the
                            Government being absent during the most heated period of the
                            Congressional session. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s plans are to make the change-over at a time from
                            late September to 10 October.<note n="9" xml:id="d140fn9">
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> formally left office

                            of the Navy Thomas in California on 10 October. He then brought up the
                            matter of the opportunity for the new Secretary of Defense to see the
                            President at frequent intervals. The President expressed the opinion
                            that is is better to stick with the policy that a Cabinet officer can
                            delay any other appointment and can come to see the President whenever
                            he wishes, rather than try to set a regular date for a meeting. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> mentioned the great
                            aid it had been to him at first to be able to come periodically to make
                            sure he was “in the ball park.”</p>
                        <p>In the matter of personnel, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> expressed the hope that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> may be prevailed upon to remain
                            in the Defense Department. No trouble on this matter is anticipated at
                            this moment. He also mentioned that <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> should be kept available if possible. However,
                            the President stated that the fact that Congress had not kept him on
                            permanent active duty makes it more difficult to make <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral Radford</persName> available.</p>

                            our commitments to the UK as regards the <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>. On this subject the President was very familiar. The

                            to supply <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> to Britain were not
                            entirely firm because of the change in price and the difficulty of
                            estimating for a product that is not yet complete.<note n="10" xml:id="d140fn10">Documentation on the meetings between President

                            assured the President that the picture is not so bleak as the $149
                            million figure (over $78 million estimated cost to US) in the fact sheet
                            of 15 August and feels that a cutback in spare parts may ease the

                        <p>When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> brought up the
                            subject of Operation Hardtack, the President stated that this subject
                            has him in a more awkward position than any other that he can think of.
                            Here he is talking disarmament and at the same time planning a
                            four-month period of atomic weapon testing which will involve
                            twenty-five shots.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> assured the President
                            that of the twenty-five, only five were under the auspices of the
                            Department of Defense.</p>
                        <p>He then went on to mention another item in cost figuring for guided
                            missiles. The Defense Department, from its own point of view, gets
                            warheads for nothing, since these are sent from <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> and are charged to <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>
                            funds. However, the smaller the warhead the more expensive as regards
                            the <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> types. Therefore, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> will henceforth
                            require all people in calculating costs of missiles to figure in the
                            cost of the warhead as well. This is something which has not been done
                            in the past and affected the Army’s optimistic figures as regards the
                            cost of the 500-mile missile. The President acknowledged this proposal
                            and felt that it was sound. However, he once again emphasized, in
                            connection with the Army missile program, that a good weapon should not
                            be taken away from the Army for the mere fact that it fires more than
                            two-hundred miles.</p>

                        <p>On August 1, 22, and September 12, the National Security Council
                            discussed the relation of port security policy to United States policy
                            toward Poland. At the August 1 meeting, the Council noted the arrival
                            that day at the Port of New Orleans of the Polish ship <hi rend="italic">Stefan Okrzeja</hi>, the exception to United States port security
                            policy (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5408) that had been made to
                            permit the ship’s entry, the security procedures which would be
                            followed, and the preparation of an <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            Planning Board study on the subject for later Council consideration.</p>
                        <p>At the meeting on August 22, the Council discussed the question of
                            suspending port denial provisions to Communist vessels under <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5408 and permitting Polish flag vessels
                            to enter specific United States ports for the purpose of loading cargo
                            being made available under P.L. 480, the Agricultural Trade Development
                            and Assistance Act of 1954. The Council “requested the Interdepartmental
                            Committee on Internal Security (<gloss target="#t_ICIS1">ICIS</gloss>)
                            to develop adequate internal security procedures for the processing of
                            ships’ personnel seeking temporarily to enter the United States via
                            Polish vessels” and deferred action on the various proposals before the
                            Council pending further study by the responsible departments and
                            agencies and further recommendations thereon by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning Board.</p>
                        <p>On September 12, the National Security Council agreed to allow Polish
                            flag vessels to enter major United States ports for the specific purpose
                            of taking on cargo to be shipped to Poland under the terms of any
                            economic agreement between the United States and Poland. Moreover, entry
                            authorized for a specific purpose did not preclude delivery or loading
                            of other cargo in such ports during the same voyage. To permit this
                            trade while the current United States policy toward Poland (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5616/2) was in effect, the denial
                            provisions of paragraph 21–c–(l) of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            5408 would be suspended. Polish vessels would normally be limited to the
                            ten major United States ports listed in paragraph 21–b of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5408, and the provisions of paragraph
                            21–c–(2) would apply to such vessels. The full provisions of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5408 would remain applicable to the
                            above types of Polish vessels seeking entry into other than the ten
                            major ports and all other Polish ships seeking to enter any United
                            States port.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">22 words not declassified</hi>] the Council noted that
                            any future review of port security policy involving entry of any
                            Communist bloc vessel as an exception to or under a suspension of
                            paragraphs 21–c–(l) and 21–d of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5408
                            should include consideration of limiting such entry to one or two minor
                            United States ports on each coast where the vessel would be kept under
                            strict surveillance.</p>

                        <p>At the meeting of the National Security Council on September 12,
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> began his oral
                            briefing as follows:</p>
                        <p>“The Director of Central Intelligence said he would first deal with the
                            circumstances around the Soviet announcement of the successful launching
                            of an intercontinental ballistic missile. He pointed out that on July 19
                            last, he had briefed the Council on the newly-established long-range
                            guided missile range in the Soviet Union. Since that time, hard evidence
                            had accumulated that this missile range was a fact, and that it extended
                            a distance of 3500 nautical miles, from Tyura-Tam to Klyuchi in
                            Kamchatka. Such a range could support limited missile flight
                            testing.</p>
                        <p>“Thereafter, Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> read the text of the Soviet
                            announcement of the successful launching of an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>. He commented that the intelligence community could
                            not say for certain that the Soviets had actually successfully tested
                            such a missile along this range, but there were certain facts and
                            indications which lent support to this contention. Our coverage of the
                            Tyura-Tam site was not yet adequate. Nevertheless, we did not find
                            certain indications of activities which we would have expected to find
                            if the missile which was fired had been an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>. Of course, some such activities could have escaped
                            us. In any event, there had been some [<hi rend="italic">number not
                                declassified</hi>] missiles fired over the Kasputin Yar range over
                            the last [<hi rend="italic">2 words not declassified</hi>], and between
                            [2 numbers not declassified] of these missiles were estimated to be
                            multi-stage weapons.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_594" n="594" facs="0618"/>
                        <p>“We are currently re-examining our previous estimate that the Soviet
                            Union could have an operational <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                            capability in 1960 or 1961. We may have to change this estimate. We
                            consider this question to be one of the highest possible priority. We
                            are likewise re-examining our previous estimate of the production by the
                            Soviet Union of heavy bombers. We are not seeing as many on the
                            airfields as we had expected.</p>
                        <p>“Secretary <persName>Anderson</persName> reminded the Council of the
                            lengths to which we went some time ago in order to obtain a Soviet
                                <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> aircraft, offering a reward if
                            such an aircraft could be flown out of the Soviet bloc. Could we not
                            succeed in obtaining the defection of some one of the brilliant Soviet
                            scientists who are working in the missiles field by making a public
                            offer of substantial monetary reward and security? There must be many
                            discontented scientists in the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>“Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said he doubted the wisdom of making a
                            public statement offering rewards of the sort suggested by Secretary
                                <persName>Anderson</persName>. Any Soviet scientist of the caliber
                            envisaged would know perfectly well that we would be very happy indeed
                            to give adequate support, financial and otherwise, to any defector.”

                            on the Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program:</p>
                        <p>“He referred to his briefing on this subject at the last meeting of the
                            National Security Council, when he had reported the possibility of [<hi rend="italic">2 words not declassified</hi>] flight test of a Soviet
                                <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>. Since that date further
                            evidence has been acquired by the intelligence community, and Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> said he would read their latest
                            findings. These findings were, in substance, that the Soviet Union has
                            probably flight-tested [<hi rend="italic">12 words not
                            declassified</hi>]. As yet, the intelligence community had no evidence
                            as to the range, accuracy, or specific character of the missiles
                            fired.</p>

                            conclusion that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> now has the

                            expenditures within a level budget of $38 billion annually during the
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>s ’59, ’60 and ’61 time period were
                            explored. In addition, the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ’58
                            military program was discussed in relation to the subsequent years.</p>
                        <p>It was the opinion of the members of the Armed Forces Policy Council that
                            it was highly important that we be able to announce the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ’58 end year strengths for each of the
                            Military Services as promptly as possible in order that an orderly
                            reduction to these figures could be planned and the maximum benefit
                            derived in holding expenditures for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            ’58 within the approved figure of $38 billion. In some cases the
                            Military Services may wish to reduce their strength below the figures
                            presently approved for 1 January 1958 in order to achieve maximum <pb xml:id="pg_596" n="596" facs="0620"/>savings. It was obvious that
                            the figures for end <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ’58 are well above
                            the totals which we will be able to maintain during <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ’59 and it appears that they can be
                            reached without materially affecting our deployments abroad.</p>

                            Secretary of State is satisfied for us to proceed immediately with the

                        <p>I have also attached as Tab (F) the figures which were discussed with the
                            National Security Council on July 25th and which you approved for
                            initial budget planning for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ’59. To
                            date these figures have been held on a highly classified basis and the
                            Military Departments now feel that they need permission to utilize them
                            to a wider degree within their staffs as the basis for the initial ’59
                            budget submissions. After the review on September 10th I see no reason
                            to use any different figures for our initial budget planning. I would
                            like your permission at this time to downgrade these figures from “top
                            secret” to “secret” so that the normal and necessary staff work on the
                            details of the ’59 budget may proceed. The proposed figures are for
                            planning purposes and, of course, are subject to your approval or
                            modification after submission and after the Joint Chiefs of Staff and
                            Service Secretaries have had an opportunity to make their final views
                            known to you.</p>
                        <p>This proposed tentative ’59 plan is also satisfactory to the Secretary of
                            State but he would like to have a week or ten days to clear certain
                            features of it with certain of our Ambassadors who are in close touch
                            with our allies and who the Secretary of State wishes to have advance
                            information before we risk the information becoming public property.
                            Following your approval I would withhold any formal documents to the
                            Services until the Secretary of State has had the time he feels
                            necessary.</p>

                        <p>On October 4, the Soviet Union launched an orbiting earth satellite,
                            called “Sputnik I.” The satellite weighed 184 pounds and orbited the
                            earth once every 88 minutes. For documentation on the international

                            <hi rend="italic">Rate of expenditures.</hi> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> showed the President several
                            charts on the trend of employment and wage rates in the aircraft
                            industry illustrating the source of the “run away” on expenditures. He
                            then showed charts indicating that, in September, expenditures were
                            brought below the “manageable” figure of $3.4 billion per month. He said
                            that expenditures would balance out at $250–275 million above the target
                            for the first quarter in this fiscal year, but should be at or below the
                            target next quarter. He said Defense could probably hit a $20.7 billion
                            figure for the first six months, but not a $20.1 figure.</p>

                            the funds estimated to be available as among the three services, and had
                            based the division on a force of 2.5 million men. One question to be
                            considered was whether to put a $38 billion budget to Congress and let
                            them cut it half a billion, or to put up a $38.5 billion budget. In this
                            connection he said all services will say that the funds allowed are too
                            small. The President said he is willing to adjust the figure to take
                            care of rising costs; but to do so would contribute to further inflation
                            and a further rise in costs. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> recommended as future budgetary <pb xml:id="pg_599" n="599" facs="0623"/>procedure, projecting a
                            continuation of the same general figures, then adjusting from that
                            projection. He would let the services plan within such projections.</p>

                                Compensation, was chaired by Ralph J. Cordiner, president of General
                                Electric Company. Created to study personnel and pay practices in
                                the military, the committee reported on May 8 that a significant gap
                                existed between the structure of military pay, which had not changed
                                since World War II, and rapidly changing military strategy. Many of

                            <hi rend="italic">implementation.</hi> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> referred to a memorandum<note n="4" xml:id="d145fn4">Not found in the Eisenhower Library or Department
                                of State files.</note> I had shown him recording the President’s
                            general thinking in this matter. He thought that the Defense proposals
                            would be in accord with that memorandum, and said that in fact they
                            would be very close to what he proposed early last spring. The President
                            said he had hoped that, if we are able to institute the Cordiner
                            recommendations, we could stand sizeable personnel cuts without
                            decreasing combat potential (through retention of trained personnel). He
                            went on to say that he thought we must include some adaptation of the
                            report in the program for the coming year.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Jupiter-Thor.</hi> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> recalled that, in starting the <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> programs, he had put in the Army-Navy
                            effort (from which the Navy has since dropped out) to see if they could
                            make more rapid progress than the Thor project, which is a “fall out”
                            from the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>. To date the test results
                            of the Jupiter are substantially the best. The Air Force approach with
                            Thor is to tool up on a substantial basis and correct and improve the
                            missile as work goes along. He said if it were necessary to decide the
                            matter today he would have to decide in favor of the Army missile.
                            However, the actual warhead and actual guidance<note n="5" xml:id="d145fn5">The word “guides” was deleted and “guidance”
                                inserted in handwriting on the source text.</note> have not yet been
                            incorporated. The choice is to go ahead on the present basis and spend
                            several million dollars more on the two programs or to chop off one
                            program now. The President said he did not feel in position to make such
                            a decision, not being a technician. He said also that Defense certainly
                            could not stop the Jupiter at the present time. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> asked whether the President
                            thought he should decide the matter before he leaves his office, and the
                            President asked how long it would take to be in position to make a
                            decision. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said it
                            should run several more months—perhaps as far as March next year. The
                            President thought Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>
                            should not try to decide the matter before leaving his post.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Army 500-mile Redstone.</hi> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said there was a split in the
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> on the Army’s developing this
                            weapon. Although there is a solid propellant weapon in prospect, it is
                            at least three to five years away. Redstone is based on a 6500 pound
                            warhead; with a smaller warhead the additional range could be attained.
                            The President said he felt the Army should not be stopped from having
                            the 500-mile missile if they are close to achieving it. Operationally,
                            it could be put 200 to 300 miles back from the front line—this is very
                            apropos, since the front will be extremely fluid. The President
                            interjected at this point that the probable sound course of procedure
                            would be to abolish the Army, Navy and Air Force and Marines and go to
                            task forces under Defense—but such an idea is probably twenty years
                            away. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said there was
                            much to commend this proposal as a better means of decentralization than
                            we have now. In summing up on this point, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> proposed to tell the Army they
                            could put their 500-mile missile in the 1959 program, seeing what they
                            can take out to provide the $45 million needed. The President
                            agreed.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Anti-missile missile.</hi> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that trouble is rising
                            between the Army and the Air Force over this missile. The Army has been
                            assigned the missile, with Air Force having the long-range detection,
                            but the Air Force is now initiating an approach involving an “area
                            weapon.” The President interjected, with some vigor, that he thought we
                            are going to have to go to a “Manhattan District” type approach in order
                            to get forward in this matter. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that is exactly what he had wanted to
                            propose to the President. The President added that he is coming to
                            believe that perhaps we should do this for all missiles—not just the
                            anti-missile missile.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Overseas deployments.</hi> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that to reach a force of
                            2.5 million it would be necessary to bring back something of the order
                            of an additional 40,000 personnel from overseas. Even so, it would be
                            possible to keep two divisions in Japan and five in Europe, running them
                            under strength, however, as the British have done on the continent.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Earth satellite.</hi> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that a result of the Soviet achievement is
                            to throw more emphasis on the missile program. He thought he had better
                            remove certain overtime restrictions now in effect. These are of minor
                            influence and cost, but some people will charge a slow-up in the program
                            because of these restrictions. The President told him he could go ahead,
                            but asked that the removal be very precisely defined. (He asked me to
                            inform Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> of this
                            decision, and I did so.) With regard to the Vanguard, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> suggested letting it run on for
                            a few months more. If the Navy should fail with its missile, however, or
                            substantially slip in its timing, he thought we had better have a back
                            up missile. The President said the use of the Redstone as the <pb xml:id="pg_601" n="601" facs="0625"/>back up had been mentioned to
                            him earlier in the day.<note n="6" xml:id="d145fn6">Reference is to a

                            conclusion that the time was not yet at hand when a clear choice could
                            be made in favor of either the Thor or the Jupiter program, and that
                            both should be continued until successful tests are achieved by one or
                            the other missile.</p>

                        <p>The President pointed out that the early <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> directives on the development of the U.S. ballistic
                            missiles program had emphasized that one of the first requirements was
                            for the achievement of a workable intermediate range ballistic missile.
                            If an attempt to develop an <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> with a
                            2000-mile range was slowing up the achievement of an <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> with a 1500-mile range, the President
                            was altogether against it. (The President’s remark derived from a
                            statement by Mr. Holaday that the British were pressing us to extend the
                            range of our <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>’s to 2000 miles.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. Holaday assured the President that the Defense Department was
                            following the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> directives implicitly,
                            and its objective continued to be the achievement of an <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> with a range of 1500 miles.</p>
                        <p>The President then inquired whether Mr. Holaday and his associates were
                            keeping under constant study the possibility of resort to a Manhattan
                            District approach for the achievement of the objectives of our ballistic
                            missiles program. Mr. Holaday replied in the affirmative, and the
                            President went on to say that we might have to consider this approach
                            despite the fact that up until now we had rejected the idea of a new
                            Manhattan District operation for the missiles program.</p>
                        <p>Referring once again to points made by Mr. Holaday, the President
                            inquired what difference it made whether the Army or the Air Force
                            conducted the test firings of these missiles. Mr. Holaday replied that
                            the Air Force fires its missiles from fixed concrete installations on
                            its airfields. The Army, on the other hand, makes use of the principle
                            of “shoot and scoot”. It was the Army’s objective to make the
                            installations for firing missiles mobile in character.</p>
                        <p>The President, after stating that he approved the recommendations with
                            respect to Thor and Jupiter proposed by Mr. Holaday, went on to say that
                            only yesterday he had again been asked how much of the delay in our
                            earth satellite program derived from inter-service rivalry. The
                            President said that he always denied the validity of such assertions,
                            but the question showed the widespread belief in our country that we are
                            competing among ourselves rather than with the Russians.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Holaday informed the President that there was very little rivalry to
                            be observed in the Project Vanguard program. The President cautioned Mr.
                            Holaday to watch this problem of inter-service rivalry all the time. The
                            objective of the program was not to achieve a missile which a particular
                            service desired, but instead to achieve the most efficient missiles
                            system. The President felt that such matters as deployment, the
                            character of the ground installations, methods of employment desired by
                            the different military services, and similar matters, were completely
                            secondary to the determination by the United States to fire a 1500-mile
                            missile and hit something. The President <pb xml:id="pg_603" n="603" facs="0627"/>emphasized that he was interested first of all in
                            achieving such a vehicle, and that nothing should be allowed to stand in
                            the way of getting it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Holaday pointed out to the President that, after all, the development
                            of ground support equipment for the missile must be carried along with
                            the development of the missile itself. Otherwise we would end up having
                            the missile but with no suitable installation from which to shoot it.
                            Nevertheless, our main effort was, of course, to get the missile.</p>
                        <p>Thereafter, the President stressed once again the great political and
                            psychological advantage of the first achievement of an <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> and an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>. He noted that from the inception of the ballistic
                            missiles program the Council had agreed that these political and
                            psychological considerations were perhaps even more important than the
                            strictly military considerations.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President referred to numerous press reports about interservice
                            rivalry and lack of adequate support for the U.S. satellite and missiles
                            programs. He warned again that we would be in for a very rough time when
                            the Congress began investigating these rumors and reports. The
                            Congressional investigators would light on every shred of evidence
                            indicating undue delay or rivalry among the services. If they think that
                            they have proved the existence of these obstacles, they will force on us
                            a single-missile program whether we like it or not.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President then referred to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LA1">Larson</persName>’s earlier remarks about the United States being
                            first in the field on the next great breakthrough. In this connection he
                            pointed out that the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> had been
                            built up as the great ultimate weapon. The Russians felt that they had
                            to possess an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> in order to frighten
                            us. But the <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> can be much more
                            dangerous to the Russians than the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                            to us. Accordingly, the <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> is of
                            extreme importance in the propaganda of the cold war.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> suggested that it
                            might be desirable for the Administration to issue a laconic factual
                            account of the entire missile development in the United States. This
                            might be published some time between now and next January. This would
                            help to correct the unfortunate impression provided by photographs of
                            missile failures, which photographs had distorted the truth of our real
                            progress in this field. Within the limits of security, we should do our
                            best to counteract this distortion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out that the
                                <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> was concerning itself with
                            publicity on the missile program, and was even now preparing a proposal

                            combining the Thor and Jupiter development programs into a single
                            missile program, as called for by <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            Action No. 1765.</p>
                        <p>b. Noted the President’s approval of the recommendation by the Secretary
                            of Defense, contained in a–(1) above, that, because the various factors
                            to be considered do not in total clearly favor the selection of one
                            program at this time, both the Thor and Jupiter programs be continued
                            until successful flight tests are achieved by either missile, in order
                            that greater assurance of the early availability of an operable missile
                            system may be achieved.</p>
                        <p>c. Noted the President’s instructions to the Department of Defense that,
                            in approving the recommendation in b above:</p>
                        <p>(1) He would expect the Department of Defense to keep under constant
                            study the most effective organizational structure for the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> programs, including the possibility of concentrating
                            such programs outside of the military services in one organization
                            similar to the wartime Manhattan District; and, if deemed desirable as a
                            result of such constant study, to make recommendations thereon to
                            him.</p>
                        <p>(2) The overriding objective of the <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>
                            program, in view of the political and psychological impact referred to
                            in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action No. 1484–c, continues to
                            be the successful achievement of an <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> with approximately 1500 miles range and reasonable
                            accuracy; and that the related problems of ground support, methods of
                            employment contemplated by the various military services, and increased
                            range, should not be allowed to delay such an achievement.</p>
                        <p>(3) Similarly, the overriding objective of the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program continues to be the successful achievement of
                            an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> with necessary range and
                            reasonable accuracy, in priority over related</p>

                        <p>Mr. McElroy asked if he might feel free to have General Randall attend
                            future sessions, and the President said to do so by all means, if he
                            wished. In further discussion, in which Mr. McElroy mentioned General
                            Randall’s value for continuity and for bringing out the key issues of
                            important questions, the President indicated that he would readily
                            understand if Mr. McElroy, in replacing General Randall, were, as a
                            means of improving attitudes in the Pentagon, to bring in a
                            well-qualified Army man.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McElroy said that he foresaw the need for sessions on two days on the
                            military budget this year. On the first day, he would plan to bring up
                            major points for the President’s confirmation; on the second, the
                            Secretaries and Chiefs of Staff would be given an opportunity to make
                            known to the President their views concerning any areas in the military
                            budget about which they have particular concern. The President indicated
                            agreement to the proposal, although bringing out that he did not think
                            the technique of telling the Secretaries and the Chiefs of decisions
                            already made was the best one. Mr. McElroy said he would give further
                            thought to this.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McElroy referred to the $38 billion figure and said he would like not
                            to regard it as a rigid ceiling. The President welcomed this comment,
                            saying that he had never wanted it to be called that. As a matter of
                            fact, he had not wished to establish a figure at all, but had done so on
                            the repeated request of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>. Although he had set it as a judgment as to a
                            proper level, he promptly found that it was being spoken of as a rigid
                            ceiling. In concluding discussion on this point, the President said Mr.
                            McElroy could bring the group in whenever he wished.</p>

                        <p>Mr. McElroy next spoke about the anti-<gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>. This is now only at the stage of technological
                            feasibility studies. At this point our interest is chiefly in whether it
                            can be achieved, and what kind of money it would cost. He was thinking
                            of organizing this activity in the Department of Defense, rather than in
                            the services and making an early announcement in order to prevent the
                            matter from getting to the point of intense rivalry. He mentioned the
                            name of a Mr. Zeter (?) of Chrysler<note n="2" xml:id="d147fn2">Presumably James C. Zeder, director of engineering, Chrysler
                                Corporation, and President, Chrysler Institute of
                                Engineering.</note> as the type of man he had in mind, and thought
                            he might be available. The President said he is willing to go ahead with
                            this type of organization if Mr. McElroy so decides.</p>
                        <p>The question of the longer range Redstone was then raised. The President
                            said he understood that there had been argument in the Chiefs about that
                            matter. He felt that if the Army could show that it could carry out this
                            range extension at reasonable cost, then they should go ahead, and Mr.
                            McElroy indicated he would take this action now.</p>
                        <p>Next raising the matter of the Cordiner Report,<note n="3" xml:id="d147fn3">See <ref target="#d145fn3">footnote 3, Document
                                    145</ref>.</note> Mr. McElroy said he had an erroneous
                            impression of the President’s position in this matter initially. Now he
                            understood that the President is not opposed to it. The President said
                            that last year he would have approved a general raise throughout
                            government to cover the cost of living, but the proposals were not
                            limited to that. He would have also approved Cordiner provisions
                            pinpointed to key problems of retaining technicians and highly trained
                            junior officers. He felt that action should go forward this year on a
                            wise application of the theory of the Cordiner provisions. In fact, he
                            would like to put it forward as a first order of business in the new
                            Congress.</p>

                        <p>The President said he wanted to have the group in to learn their state of
                            mind and to see what ideas and proposals they might have that they would
                            like to advance. He said he had been reflecting very earnestly on the
                            question of how all of the many scientific activities throughout the
                            government, or supported by the government, could be best supported. He
                            referred to certain paragraphs in the National Science Foundation
                            brochure on basic research.<note n="3" xml:id="d148fn3">Not further
                                identified.</note> He said it is all well and good to accept the
                            importance of basic research, but government officials have some
                            responsibility to assure that money provided is actually used for
                            research, and not diverted to other ends. However, to do so might result
                            in intrusion into university activity. He asked whether the group really
                            thought that American science is being outdistanced, and asked for an
                            expression of the state of mind of the members.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RII1">Rabi</persName> said that the problem the
                            President had mentioned, of management of research in government, is of
                            course of central concern to his group. He added that if the President
                            wanted to do something about it, they could certainly make some
                            suggestions to him. The President asked specifically how this work might
                            proceed, and General <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>
                            suggested (and it was agreed) that the committee might prepare and
                            submit a draft of terms of reference for such a study.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_608" n="608" facs="0632"/>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RII1">Rabi</persName> then went on to speak of
                            our scientific position now and in the next few years in relation to the
                            Soviets. He said that we can now see some advantages on our part.
                            However, the Soviets have picked up tremendous momentum, and unless we
                            take vigorous action they could pass us swiftly just as in a period of
                            twenty to thirty years we caught up with Europe and left Western Europe
                            far behind.</p>
                        <p>At Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RII1">Rabi</persName>’s request, Dr. Land
                            then spoke—with great eloquence—about the great problem that is before
                            us. He said that the country needs a great deal from science. But he
                            felt that science, to provide this, needs the President acutely. The
                            Soviets are now in a pioneering stage and frame of mind. They regard
                            science both as an essential tool and as a way of life. They are
                            teaching their young people to enjoy science. Curiously, in the United
                            States we are not now great builders for the future but are rather
                            stressing production in great quantities of things we have already
                            achieved. In Russia science is now being pursued both for enjoyment and
                            for the strength of the country. He asked if there is not some way in
                            which the President could inspire the country—setting out our youth
                            particularly on a whole variety of scientific adventures. If he were to
                            do that, there would be tremendous returns. At the present time
                            scientists feel themselves isolated and alone, but all of this could
                            change.</p>
                        <p>The President questioned the statement that the Russians attempt to
                            inspire all of their people with science. He thought they had instead
                            followed the practice of picking out the best minds and ruthlessly
                            spurning the rest. At least he had been given that impression when he
                            associated with them. As to Dr. Land’s main point, however, he said he
                            thought he could help and do part of the job. However, the need for a
                            coordinated effort would still exist. In fact, he said he would like to
                            try to create a spirit—an attitude toward science similar to that held
                            toward various kinds of athletics in his youth—an attitude which now
                            seemed to him to have palled somewhat. He would think that one speech
                            would not do the job. There would be a need for great carry-through. He
                            added that perhaps now is a good time to try such a thing. People are
                            alarmed and thinking about science, and perhaps this alarm could be
                            turned to a constructive result.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RII1">Rabi</persName> said that many of the
                            policy matters that come up to the President have a strong scientific
                            component. He pointed out that the President lacks a scientific advisor,
                            or someone who can provide him with a scientific point of view. The
                            President said that it might be well to have such an advisor, or even a
                            small section, to support him. He said the group would have to
                            recognize, however, that every such individual added simply adds to the
                            burdens of the Presidency—but perhaps the individual could be a great
                            help in getting the right point of view across. He said he would like to
                            hear something more specific as to their ideas. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RII1">Rabi</persName> said the first essential is to get
                            someone <pb xml:id="pg_609" n="609" facs="0633"/>whom the President can
                            live with easily (in the sense of working with him agreeably); this
                            individual should be completely sound scientifically as well. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> added that a
                            committee to back up the individual would also have great value, and the
                            President agreed, using the analogy of the Council of Economic Advisors.
                            The President said that such an individual could be most helpful. For
                            example, he could keep a record of decisions and actions affecting
                            scientific matters. He referred to his decision to give top priority to
                            the development of operational ballistic missiles at the earliest
                            possible date. Subsequently secondary considerations were introduced
                            which tended to delay this overriding objective. One of the group
                            suggested that the scientific advisor could help the President not to
                            forget such policy decisions. The President interjected with vehemence
                            that he had not forgotten this view but that those charged with the
                            program had.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> said that these
                            comments had great value in the long term for the creation of a more
                            fertile climate for scientific activity. In the short term, there is
                            missing a sense of urgency and mission in the scientific community.
                            Certain subjects need to be attacked that are not now being
                            investigated. He thought that if we continue to go as we are now the
                            Russians will surpass us, and it will not take them long to do so. The
                            question is how to get the research and development programs in Defense
                            into focus. The need is more for leadership than for money. The
                            President said he thought he had a fine man in Mr. McElroy. Already he
                            has been impressed with Mr. McElroy’s approach. He thought it might be
                            well for the group to meet with McElroy. (At this point I left the
                            meeting and called Secretary McElroy, and on rejoining the meeting
                            arranged an appointment for the group with the Secretary at 1:30 this
                            afternoon.)</p>
                        <p>As I returned Dr. Wiesner was telling the President that much of the
                            problem relating to the timing on missiles and the satellite came from
                            our late start on them—rather than delays in their conduct after they
                            were initiated by this Administration. The President said he has avoided
                            going into that matter because it becomes immediately political, and he
                            just does not want to do that.</p>
                        <p>I left the meeting again for a moment in connection with the McElroy
                            appointment. When I returned the group was discussing the need for
                            scientific collaboration with our allies. The President said that much
                            of the difficulty went back to 1945 and the Fuchs case.<note n="4" xml:id="d148fn4">In 1949 British physicist Klaus Fuchs confessed to
                                giving atomic secrets to the Soviet Union.</note> When this incident
                            occurred, the Congress decided to bar all atomic information to the
                            British. He asked General Cutler and me to see that a careful
                            examination is made of authority under the law for exchange of
                            scientists and scientific information, and analysis of what would have
                                <pb xml:id="pg_610" n="610" facs="0634"/>to be done to set up a
                            joint committee. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RII1">Rabi</persName>
                            suggested the need for a scientific man in the State Department, but
                            this was not discussed. Dr. Hill (and others) said that our security
                            regulations cause a large part of the difficulty with our
                            allies—particularly in areas other than atomic. The President recalled
                            how he has personally worked at this problem over a number of years.</p>
                        <p>In further discussion the President said that he would take the
                            opportunity to speak out on the question of a proper attitude toward
                            science (the Land suggestion), perhaps using his next press
                                conference.<note n="5" xml:id="d148fn5">For text of the transcript
                                of the President’s news conference on October 30, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United

                            would bring out that our people should take an interest and a concern in
                            science, and not just leave the matter to scientists. Some follow-up
                            would be needed, however. On the point of adequate recognition of
                            scientists, he recalled that he had tried to get Mrs. Hobby<note n="6" xml:id="d148fn6">Oveta Culp Hobby, Secretary of Health, Education,
                                and Welfare, 1953–1955.</note> to set up a series of awards for
                            distinction in science and the arts, something along the lines of the
                            French Academy but of even higher standing. He indicated that success
                            has not yet been achieved. He mentioned also his plan to visit the
                            Redstone Arsenal and the missile firing center, and told how the
                            problems of the Presidency affect such things, in that he had to cancel
                            the visit because a trip by him to an Army post in the South at the
                            present time would be harmful and misunderstood.</p>
                        <p>In concluding the meeting, the President asked me to have a check made
                            into the restrictions that prevent exchange of information. He asked the
                            group to include in the study for which they are to prepare terms of
                            reference just what we have done in the area of science since 1945. As
                            the group left the meeting, several of them came up to me to express
                            their enthusiasm and appreciation for the session they had had with the
                            President.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that over
                            the previous weekend there had been a great deal of talk of bad funding
                            practices on the part of the government—that deliveries would be
                            required and accepted with payment not being made until much later. He
                            felt it was clear that there was need for a clarifying statement.
                            Accordingly, he met with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> and Mr. McElroy to find out how much above $38
                            billion in expenditures we would have to go to be assured of paying for
                            materials when delivered. He said the Defense Department stated they
                            could make payments on time for $19.4 billion expenditures in the first
                            six months of this fiscal year and $19.2 billion in the second. He said
                            that Mr. McElroy does feel that some subcontractors will have to fund
                            more of their work in progress and will have to hold down on
                            inventories, but felt that they should be required to do so. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said he had also
                            talked with Mr. William McChesney Martin<note n="2" xml:id="d149fn2">Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.</note> about the matter. He
                            intended to inform a few key banks that the need for capital for
                            contractors to carry progress costs will be of the order of not more
                            than $200 million instead of the $2 or $3 billion being discussed in the
                            scare stories.</p>
                        <p>The President thought we should make a statement that in 1957 and 1958
                            procurement will be so much in each year, and that we will pay our bills
                            when they come due.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that the
                            fund proposals allow for an additional $100 million for the Air Force
                            and $100 million for the Navy after the first of the year. He thought
                            that he could still hold the debt below the debt ceiling, with such
                            figures, if all goes well with collections as now foreseen. He indicated
                            he would meet with Secretary McElroy and get a statement out which
                            should have a great stabilizing effect. He reported that at the
                            beginning of trading on the 23rd, he had called Mr. Funston<note n="3" xml:id="d149fn3">George Keith Funston, President of the New York
                                Stock Exchange.</note> in New York, that the market was <pb xml:id="pg_612" n="612" facs="0636"/>up strongly at opening, and
                            sentiment was strong for buying, with a great increase in confidence
                            after the President’s speech the night before.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that
                            companies like Boeing are following a course which is greatly alarming
                            their subcontractors, and in some cases the actions seem to be
                            deliberate. For this reason Mr. McElroy is setting up a special place
                            for subcontractors to come to if they feel that they have been treated
                            unfairly. The President strongly endorsed this procedure.</p>
                        <p>The President thought that in the present climate a giant step toward
                            unification could be made. This might permit the Secretary of Defense to
                            close out numerous installations, cut down overhead, etc.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> added to his earlier figures that $60
                            million additional is to be provided to the Army for the Jupiter
                            project.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> said he would like to
                            have the $400 million addition as a ceiling, to be reached only if
                            completely necessary.</p>
                        <p>The President said he thought that rising costs have made our figures out
                            of date. He said he was absolutely determined that we will and must meet
                            all U.S. obligations. He would, however, call in the big manufacturers
                            and tell them that if they start up scare stories again we will change
                            our contracting methods and deal directly with subcontractors. There was
                            discussion of the fact that the big contractors have very little of
                            their own equity, but are operating on government financing, and using
                            government-contract-supported public relations officers to spread these
                            scare stories.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that
                            Secretary McElroy received commitments from the Service Secretaries to
                            meet these figures and not to run over.</p>
                        <p>The President and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> discussed further the action of big contractors
                            in trying to start a scare campaign.</p>

                            Major Forces—Army, Navy and Air Force”.<note n="5" xml:id="d150fn5">The
                                chart is filed in the minutes.</note> This chart not only made the
                            comparison in terms of the status of the <pb xml:id="pg_614" n="614" facs="0638"/>military programs as of June 30, 1957, but included two
                            additional columns giving the estimated size of selected major forces on
                            June 30, 1958, and June 30, 1959, based on estimated budget support to
                            be provided in this period.</p>
                        <p>The chart indicated that while we had 18 Army divisions as of June 30,
                            1957, we would have 15 Army divisions as of June 30, 1958, and 14 Army
                            divisions as of June 30, 1959. The comparable figures for naval vessels
                            were 967, 901 and 864. The comparable figures for combat wings in the
                            Air Force were 137, 117 and 103.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of Colonel Rosson’s presentation, the President
                            inquired as to the results of tests made to determine the efficiency of
                            our military communications systems. Colonel Rosson replied that in
                            general our test exercises indicated that there would be a severe
                            overloading of these communications in the initial period of general
                            war, but that the situation would improve thereafter.</p>
                        <p>Prompted by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>, the
                            President inquired with respect to the concentration of <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> bombers on certain airfields. He had
                            heard earlier that morning a report that all our B–52 bombers were
                            concentrated on a single field. Colonel Rosson replied that this was not
                            a statement of fact. Secretary Douglas added the information that there
                            were three wings of B–52’s on three bases. Our 1958 program permitted
                            only five additional bases, although our goal for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 would have been 11.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President inquired as to the meaning of the term “nuclear
                            capable”. Colonel Rosson explained that this term defined a delivery
                            capability for nuclear weapons. The Vice President went on to say that
                            the reason that he had asked his question was that the term “operational
                            capability” was now so much talked of in the press, especially in
                            relation to Soviet missiles. Could Colonel Rosson also explain this
                            term? Did this refer only to an initial capability? Colonel Rosson
                            replied that the term “operational capability” was a term with
                            progressive meaning, running all the way from an initial capability to a
                            full capability in all units.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> expressed concern
                            that the charts which had been displayed seemed to indicate that our
                            aircraft capabilities were diminishing without indicating a concurrent
                            increase in our missiles capability. After all, the basis on which we
                            were cutting down on our aircraft capability was that we should have an
                            increasing capability in missiles.</p>
                        <p>The President pointed out that no one could quarrel with the fact of the
                            increased effectiveness of our combat wings, even though the number of
                            these wings was fewer.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> said the purpose of the
                            meeting was to enable Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RII1">Rabi</persName> to
                            present some findings of the Scientific Advisory Committee, regarding an
                            emergency defense against the Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> to the President. The essence of the recommendation
                            was that, in view of a defect our scientists feel exists in the Soviet
                            atomic weapon for their <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>, we should
                            proceed at once to develop an anti-<gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                            system, particularly for the safeguarding of <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>, and should give consideration to discontinuing atomic
                            tests at once, before the Soviets achieve the thing they are now lacking
                            in their weapon.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RII1">Rabi</persName> said the Soviets must be
                            expected to have an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> in the fairly
                            near future, and to have a warhead for it. The warhead may be expected
                            to have the same weakness our earlier ones had. By exploding a 100
                                <gloss target="#t_KT1">KT</gloss> weapon at an altitude over 100,000
                            feet, within several miles of the incoming Soviet weapon, pre-initiation
                            of the Soviet weapon, with a low order explosion, would be induced. To
                            safeguard <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> there should be initiated
                            the construction of long-range radar for <pb xml:id="pg_616" n="616" facs="0640"/>this defensive system, and this radar is estimated to
                            cost about $10 million per site. He added that if the Soviets continue
                            development and testing they seem certain to discover the feature that
                            they now lack.</p>
                        <p>The President pointed out that if we were to discontinue testing, we
                            should be making a complete, sudden reversal in our position. It is hard
                            to see how we could do this in terms of our public opinion, and the
                            opinion of our allies. He recalled that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> had suggested accepting an early cessation and
                            we rejected his proposal. To do this now would require great skill of
                            presentation and explanation. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RII1">Rabi</persName> said he thought it was a tragedy that we did not
                            stop our tests before the Soviets tested their thermonuclear warhead in
                            their last series. The President recalled that he had often said that if
                            we are ahead of the Soviets in these matters, we should agree to stop in
                            order to freeze our advantage. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RII1">Rabi</persName> said that if we continue to conduct tests we will
                            get better weapons, but relatively the Soviets will catch up with
                            us.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Strauss said that he is inclined to question some of the
                            assumptions and conclusions of the study, and General Cutler suggested
                            that as a next step the scientists holding various points of view should
                            get together. With regard to the cessation of the testing, Admiral
                            Strauss brought out that the Soviets can always “steal our secrets”, and
                            I raised the point as to assurance against the possibility that tests
                            would be conducted without our knowledge.</p>
                        <p>The President said that, in addition to the scientists, it is necessary
                            to have the Secretary of State and others study this proposal, because
                            we would be changing our international position. We would also have to
                            take care to bring our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies
                            along. He would, however, like the group to bring together <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>’s scientists and others concerned to
                            resolve a common view. Then he would have to consider what to do, if the
                            change is made, in order to retain the confidence of our allies and our
                            own people.</p>
                        <p>During the discussion Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RII1">Rabi</persName>
                            indicated it had been a great mistake for the President to accept the
                            views of Drs. Teller and Lawrence.<note n="2" xml:id="d151fn2">See the
                                memorandum of conference with the President, June 24, <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., p. 638.</note> The President recalled
                            that he had seen them because of a request by the Joint Committee on
                            Atomic Energy. He added that he thought they were eminent in their field
                            (as all agreed they were). He asked Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RII1">Rabi</persName> if there was mutual respect between the various
                            groups. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RII1">Rabi</persName> responded in a
                            manner which tended to indicate that there was, although his statement
                            was simply that they had known each other for twenty years or more.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_617" n="617" facs="0641"/>
                        <p>With regard to the thermonuclear weapon, the President said he had always
                            felt that the delay could have been fatal to us. He retains some
                            question, however, as to whether the Soviets did not get the secret from
                            us. General Cutler said that Dr. Bohr<note n="3" xml:id="d151fn3">Niels
                                H.D. Bohr, Danish nuclear physicist.</note> had indicated he thought
                            that the Soviets had developed that weapon on their own but had checked
                            their line of development against the data they obtained from us.</p>
                        <p>The President said he would talk to the Secretary of State and tell him
                            what we might be up against. He said the first thing to do is to get the
                            scientists of the various groups together and see how they resolve the
                            matter. They should consider whether tests could be conducted free from
                            detection. At this point Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RII1">Rabi</persName>
                            said the group was not recommending cessation of tests but simply that
                            this action be studied. They were recommending action against the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>. On this point the President said it
                            will be very interesting to observe how soon the Soviets are able to
                            make the transition from initial test to a true operational
                            capability.</p>

                        <p>The President began by saying he had discussed the atomic energy program
                            with Admiral Strauss yesterday, and had asked him to cut down all
                            overhead, construction, administrative costs—everything but the weapons
                                production.<note n="2" xml:id="d152fn2">No record of this meeting
                                has been found in the Eisenhower Library or Department of State
                                files.</note> He said that Admiral Strauss had, in explaining what
                                <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> would do if cut $200 million,
                            said they would take the major part of the cut out of weapons. The
                            President then went <pb xml:id="pg_618" n="618" facs="0642"/>on to ask
                            what is going to be done with this tremendous number of enormous
                            weapons. When we get into such figures, it is clear we are providing for
                            elaborate reserves, and making very pessimistic estimates as to what can
                            get to the target. However, the B–52, he understands, still has great
                            penetrating power. <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General
                                Twining</persName> confirmed that this is correct and added that the
                            Rascal missile (air to ground missile) has just been very successfully
                            tested, and this will help with penetration. He indicated that he has
                            been thinking we are getting about enough of the large-sized weapons. He
                            would say that the Air Force will not be happy until they get one for
                            every aircraft plus a sizeable reserve.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether the figures shown to him by <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General Twining</persName> in a memorandum
                            setting forth <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> agreed recommendations
                            on the atomic weapons stockpile objective for 1950 [<hi rend="italic">1960</hi>?] could be reached without additional building or
                            expansion of facilities.<note n="3" xml:id="d152fn3">Not found in the
                                Eisenhower Library or Department of State files.</note> He asked
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General Twining</persName> to take this
                            paper to Admiral Strauss, indicating the President has seen his paper,
                            and asked him to provide a statement that the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> has facilities in commission and active operation to
                            build these without additional construction costs. The President
                            indicated he would hold up action on this matter until he received the
                            letter from Admiral Strauss,<note n="3" target="d152fn3">Not found in
                                the Eisenhower Library or Department of State files.</note> at which
                            time he would plan to advise <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General
                                Twining</persName> that the memorandum was approved.</p>
                        <p>The President then said he had two matters he wished to discuss. The
                            first was the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> atomic stockpile. He
                            suggested that <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">General Norstad</persName>
                            might prepare a specific plan for this project prior to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting, and suggested that <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General Twining</persName> send a man over to
                            work with <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">General Norstad</persName> as to
                            what could be done under existing law. <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General Twining</persName> said that his office is now working up a
                            plan which he would have taken over to be discussed and cleared with
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">General Norstad</persName> at an early
                            date. The President said it should go into all the major questions
                            involved such as facilities, training, units, custody, etc.</p>
                        <p>The President said the second subject he wished to discuss arose out of
                            his experience and observations as <gloss target="#t_SHAEF1">SHAEF</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">shape</gloss>. He
                            thought the joint staff should be organized functionally, with each
                            section headed by a single person—in other words, a truly integrated
                            staff. The individual heading each section would give a single
                            recommendation (showing a nonconcurrence if one of his officers held a
                            deep-seated contrary view). He said he would support legislation to give
                            special recognition and special status to officers serving on the joint
                            staff. For example, if the Director and Chairman approved his service
                            for the first six months, he could be given an extra grade, under <pb xml:id="pg_619" n="619" facs="0643"/>a provision that he would
                            revert to the top of his previous grade when he left his joint
                            assignment. The big thing is to create a national outlook so that when
                            Chiefs ask for an answer they get, not what each service thinks, but
                            what highly selected, highly intelligent men think to be the best
                            solution.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General Twining</persName> told the
                            President there have been no split papers by the Chiefs since he assumed
                            his post. He also said that Mr. McElroy has promised him that when a
                            minor point of disagreement is sent up for decision he will decide it
                            promptly. <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General Twining</persName>
                            thought real progress is being made in the joint operations.</p>
                        <p>The President reverted to his idea that we should put service on the
                            joint staff in such a position that it is difficult to get an
                            assignment, and an assignment is highly sought. He said he thought we
                            should give a mark of distinction to people serving on the staff, and
                            asked <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General Twining</persName> to look
                            for a way to do this.</p>
                        <p>The President suggested that there might be great value in cutting down
                            the service public information offices, and putting them in Defense,
                            with the exception of very tiny groups which would simply answer
                            questions.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General Twining</persName> thought there
                            was much to be gained in this direction. He then said that he had drawn
                            to the attention of the Chiefs service documents providing guidelines
                            for speeches which in many cases simply tell how to criticize the other
                            services. He had no quarrel with a man “bragging” on his own service,
                            but thought it was harmful when he criticized another.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General Twining</persName> said he had also
                            gotten out of the file <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> had left him many memoranda giving the
                            President’s views on the functioning of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>. They had discussed these and found the observations
                            very helpful.</p>
                        <p>The President spoke strongly in favor of raising the prestige of the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff in every possible way. He asked <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General Twining</persName> to see how the office
                            could be organized for this purpose. He suggested first making the
                            Director a true Chief of Staff, and second, letting each section be
                            headed by a single man.</p>

                        <p>General Cutler began by saying the group had carried out its work
                            pursuant to an instruction to examine active and passive defense of the
                            United States.<note n="3" xml:id="d153fn3">
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action No. 1691–b–(2); see <ref target="#d114fn7">footnote 7, Document 114</ref>.</note> He said
                            the full report would be made to the Council on Thursday,<note n="4" xml:id="d153fn4">See <ref target="#d156">Document 156</ref>.</note>
                            and recommendations would then go to the departments for study and
                            comment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Gaither made the presentation. He said the group had concentrated its
                            attention primarily on the deterrent. They had therefore studied
                            security in the broadest possible sense of survival in the atomic age.
                            He had six principal points to make. The group appraised the threat very
                            thoroughly. They had found that our active defenses are almost
                            insignificant. They felt that our strategic air force could be knocked
                            out on the ground today and that by 1959 <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> will be highly vulnerable to the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>, and our population critically
                            vulnerable. They considered that the long-term risk to our people is
                            increasing and will continue to increase. They felt that we must expand
                            our basic strength, both that of the United States and that of the free
                            world.</p>
                        <p>As to the threat, the group saw no change in Soviet objectives and felt
                            that the growth of the threat therefore lies in the growing power of
                            Soviet forces—e.g. their weapons, jets, new missiles, etc. The peril to
                            the United States must be measured in megatonnage in the years
                            ahead.</p>
                        <p>They felt that today our deterrent force is inadequate. In event of
                            hostilities, we would have to expect population casualties of up to
                            50%.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_621" n="621" facs="0645"/>
                        <p>They thought it was highly important to give greater security to our
                            strategic offensive power through reducing response time and increasing
                            warning time, through dispersing, and through providing a better active
                            defense of <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>. They consider that we
                            should increase our strategic offensive power through the introduction
                            of diversified missiles. At least until we have the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> we should deploy <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>s overseas beginning in 1959, when the
                            Soviets may be expected to have <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s
                            available.</p>
                        <p>The group thought we must improve our defenses. They were not decided
                            with regard to blast shelters, feeling the matter needed more study.
                            They were inclined to give priority to the strategic offensive over
                            provision of blast shelters. With regard to fallout shelters, the group
                            was initially skeptical but is now less skeptical (although not
                            apparently decided). It is necessary to bear in mind that active
                            defenses would not give an assurance of protection.</p>
                        <p>He then went on to deal with certain more fundamental points. He thought
                            it was necessary to make every effort to improve the management of our
                            security resources, referring to organization, communications, and
                            decision-making. He said the group was heartened by plans for the
                            mobilization of the resources of the free world. In conclusion, he said
                            the group thought the American people could be brought to support the
                            necessary programs. The President said all military strength is of
                            course relative to what a possible adversary has. He did, however, feel
                            that we are getting close to absolutes when the ability exists to
                            inflict 50% casualties on an enemy. In those circumstances there is in
                            reality no defense except to retaliate. He said he thought our strategic
                            forces are stronger than the group may have indicated. Our bases
                            overseas give a great capacity for dispersion. With regard to the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>, here is one case in which a central
                            position is not an advantage to the Soviets. The free world holds the
                            periphery and can pose a threat from a multitude of points. He felt that
                            maximum massive retaliation remains the crux of our defense.</p>
                        <p>He was inclined to think that what we put into defense measures should be
                            put into the security of our striking forces. For the next five years he
                            thought that aircraft would still be the primary means of carrying out
                            destruction, and during this period we have the capability of delivering
                            the greater blow. The true critical period could be foreseen five years
                            from now. He recalled that a scientific group in his office a few days
                            ago had made just this point—that we are not behind now, but we must
                            make great exertions in order not to fall behind.<note n="5" xml:id="d153fn5">See <ref target="#d148">Document 148</ref>.</note>
                            This means we must educate our people for the scientific and
                            technological needs, and must also educate our people so they will
                            support what is required.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_622" n="622" facs="0646"/>
                        <p>The difficult thing is that, in our democracies, we can apparently only
                            do this with crisis, and we do not think government by crisis is the
                            right process. The crux is, therefore, how to keep up interest and
                            support without hysteria. He pointed out that to retain a free
                            enterprise system we must retain incentives, and noted that the group’s
                            study had not embraced these complications. This to his mind was the
                            most difficult problem. Americans will carry a challenging load for a
                            couple of years, but it is very hard to obtain the commitments to
                            indefinite burdens.</p>
                        <p>He agreed with the recommendations on the dispersal of <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>, but pointed out that this seems to go
                            very slowly. He agreed to the need for protection of fuels and weapons.
                            In this connection he mentioned that we have dispersed many of our
                            weapons. He thought it was hard to put across the necessity for a choice
                            between guns and butter, but considered that this is what we face. He
                            cited the need to have a plan to improve and strengthen our forces year
                            by year, rather than to fluctuate and go by fits and starts. He said he
                            was much encouraged by the fact that this group had come to these
                            conclusions, in view of the influence he knew its members to have.</p>
                        <p>The President said he was inclined to think that shelters rank rather low
                            in the list of priorities. He recognized that some might be developed on
                            a local basis. In general, he thought it would be better to use the same
                            funds for other things. Mr. McCloy said that the study on shelters had
                            indicated a cost of the order of $100 per life possibly saved. The
                            President said he was not opposed to shelters, and recognized that
                            knowledge of a shelter capability in the United States would tend to
                            deter the Soviets from attempting an attack, and that this consideration
                            puts a little different light on the matter. But if 50% destruction of
                            our industries and cities occurred, he did not see how the nation could
                            survive as an organized society.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McCloy then cited the need for organizational improvement. He said
                            there is a feeling in the country that interservice bickering and
                            rivalry is hurting us a great deal. The President referred to proposals
                            for a Manhattan project for missiles but said he had been advised five
                            years ago when he considered this proposal, and had just been advised
                            again, that development is so embedded in the services that a change
                            would involve uprooting which would delay or hamper the program. He said
                            that Mr. McElroy is preparing for all future development to go under a
                            single director, and will go for authority, perhaps involving new
                            legislation, to allow the top missiles man in Defense more power to
                            control missile development. Mr. McCloy said that the interservice
                            rivalry is now spreading to industry, universities, etc. which are
                            tending to be tied to particular services.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_623" n="623" facs="0647"/>
                        <p>The President said the key question is why can’t we be one in national
                            defense. He mentioned that he was having the top military and civilian
                            people in the Defense Department to a stag dinner that evening.<note n="6" xml:id="d153fn6">A memorandum of record of the meeting
                                following that dinner is <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>.</note> He
                            said he is coming to think that the services should become training,
                            logistical and administrative establishments, and that the joint staff
                            should be made completely unified and integrated. There is advantage in
                            having a new Secretary of Defense at this time, because he can take
                            these steps without fixing blame or engaging in recriminations. With
                            regard to the ballistic missiles, the President pointed out that we
                            really began work in 1954 and 1955, when the light warhead came in
                            sight.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McCloy referred to a feeling that is developing among our allies.
                            They are now tending to recognize that the United States cannot wholly
                            provide security—that they must themselves participate if security is to
                            be maintained. In order to do so, however, there must be an exchange of
                            information. The President said he hoped the group would educate some of
                            those opposing exchange of information. Mr. McCloy said he thought the
                            President could “blow the opposition out of the water.” The President
                            recalled that he is a minority President with respect to Congress, and
                            that he cannot alienate the Democratic party by attacking some of its
                            leading members. Mr. Stanton said he recognized there is a difficult
                            problem on the Hill, but thought that public education would help a
                            great deal. The President said he is going to do his best to avoid
                            partisanship in his speeches, trying to make them dispassionate, but
                            will try desperately to get the facts across.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McCloy said that he did not see any tax reduction in the present
                            situation. He pointed out that the proposals involve some increases in
                            expenditures. The President said he wants at least token reduction in
                            the “butter” side of government. He would be in better position to have
                            defense costs go up in that case. He mentioned the $38 billion figure
                            and recalled that the department kept coming to him and asking what will
                            you give us. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> had estimated a $38
                            billion requirement during their visit to Puerto Rico in early 1955. He
                            had said he hoped he would never have to go above $39 billion. Finally,
                            he went in for $38 billion in the last Congress and was cut to less than
                            $36. He recognized that an increase above $38 billion is inevitable.
                            Inflation alone had resulted in a 6% rise in prices since that figure
                            was established.</p>
                        <p>The President said that groups must be organized throughout universities,
                            business groups, and other elements of influence, including all those
                            who have taken an inside part in governmental affairs, to put across the
                            needs of the situation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Foster</persName> said that the <pb xml:id="pg_624" n="624" facs="0648"/>President is the one man who could accomplish this. He
                            could go out and get support of nonpartisan groups. The President
                            recalled the difficulties that must be foreseen. He mentioned that he
                            had gone all out in two speeches last spring, had obtained splendid
                            popular support, but that the effect on Congress was almost nil. He did
                            feel that there is a spiral of confidence and optimism; if we clarify
                            one major problem in the minds of the people, confidence will spread, he
                            thought. He mentioned that someone had advised him recently not to say
                            this is a problem that will last forty years, but simply to call for a
                            spurt of activity now. He thought this was an inaccurate picture, and
                            besides we must bring ourselves to carry the load until the Soviets
                            change internally.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Stanton suggested that the opening speech of the President’s speech
                            series would be much more effective if given from the White House, and
                            soon. The President said he would restudy the scheduling of this speech
                            with the idea of possibly giving it from the White House on Thursday
                            November 7th.<note n="7" xml:id="d153fn7">See <ref target="#d159">Document 159</ref>.</note> In concluding the discussion, the
                            President said he did not see any chance of the group finishing their
                            job. He thought it would be well for the group to be kept together to
                            review the matter every now and then.</p>

                        <p>Following dinner on Monday evening (November 4) the President met with
                            the Chiefs and Secretaries of the Military Departments for discussion in
                            the Red Room. He said he wanted to have a kind of seminar, throwing out
                            some ideas and having the others challenge them or add thoughts of their
                            own.</p>
                        <p>He began by saying that he had had three conferences earlier in the
                                day,<note n="2" xml:id="d154fn2">For the record of one of these

                            greatly stressing that our people are deeply concerned over rivalry in
                            our military establishment. The question was <pb xml:id="pg_625" n="625" facs="0649"/>repeatedly raised, are we sufficiently unified? Are we
                            getting the best personal judgment of our officers, rather than a
                            parroting of service party lines? General White said he thought that the
                            area of missile development is the one where there is least reality to
                            the charges of harmful rivalry. There has been competition, but it has
                            had a good effect. It is clear which service is to operate the various
                            missiles, so rivalry of that kind has been eliminated. <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General Twining</persName> said that one of the
                            great needs has been the need for timely decisions. If matters are
                            allowed to drag on they will cause bad feeling. Now he has been assured
                            by the Secretary that, when decisions are needed, they will be made.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Taylor</persName> said that a
                            clear distinction should be made between missile development and missile
                            use. In the case of the Army, they were not particularly interested
                            initially in developing the 1500-mile missile, since their concern is
                            with shorter-range weapons. However, they are pushing this project, with
                            a full understanding that the product will be turned over to the Air
                            Force. They do, however, feel the need for missiles of shorter range.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General Twining</persName> intervened
                            to say that this is one point that is clear—the Army is to have no
                            missiles more than 200-mile range. He indicated that the Joint Chiefs
                            were not agreed as to the Army having longer range weapons. The
                            President said he did not accept the idea of such a fixed mile
                            limitation. He saw great advantage in the Army having missiles that
                            could be more centrally located, further back from the battle area which
                            is bound to be a turbulent one, and able to fire on all parts of the
                            sector. He thought that the Army should go ahead and take advantage of
                            the possibilities of added range arising from lightened warheads, and
                            then all of the services should consider how the resulting weapon could
                            be effectively employed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McElroy said that he is moving toward a more unified approach in the
                            missiles field and cited the anti-<gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                            as an example of a project of this kind. The President, referring to
                            earlier discussion, said that the Joint Chiefs must be above narrow
                            service considerations. He did not regard organization as an answer in
                            itself, except as it leads individuals to take a broader outlook. He
                            said each one should try to approach problems from a national standpoint
                            accepting that he may be overridden on occasion. It is wrong to stress,
                            or simply to press for Army, Navy, and other service interests. He
                            recalled that in 1947 he had favored a tight merger of the services, but
                            this had not been adopted. He indicated he still holds that view as the
                            soundest solution.</p>
                        <p>He then went on to mention the excellent experiences he had had with
                            integrated staffs in <gloss target="#t_SHAEF1">SHAEF</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">shape</gloss>, and said he wanted to draw up
                            another major proposal. He thought that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> should remain as they are presently constituted, that
                            they should remove operational functions from the service staffs which
                            thereafter would concern themselves with mobilization administration,
                            logistics, etc. <pb xml:id="pg_626" n="626" facs="0650"/>The joint staff
                            should be organized on an integrated basis, reporting to the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> as a corporate body. He said he would
                            like to see every man on the joint staff given some special recognition.
                            For example, after six months service he could be raised a grade if he
                            were below the grade of Colonel. When he returned to his service, he
                            could go to the top of the grade previously held. He thought the members
                            of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> should turn over the
                            executive direction of their service to their deputy and should
                            concentrate on their joint responsibilities. He recalled previous
                            discussions with them urging them to take the stance of
                                soldier-states-men.<note n="3" xml:id="d154fn3">See <ref target="#d152">Document 152</ref>.</note> He then asked for
                            comments.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Admiral Burke</persName> said he would
                            venture to disagree on some aspects of the President’s proposal. He said
                            that the individual Chiefs have different experiences and qualifications
                            going back many years, as do the service members of the joint staff. The
                            disagreements in the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> do not arise
                            because of service, he said, but because of the individual experiences
                            of the members. He said that he must have staff help and advice, for
                            which he had to look to his own office. Many of the problems that arise
                            are not susceptible of final solution, but must be worked at day by day.
                            It would be easy to generate a group eager to please the top men, and it
                            is essential to have the deep judgment to bring to the problem. The
                            President intervened strongly asking why it would not be better to have
                            composite, well-thought-out positions, reflecting the experience of many
                            people of differing backgrounds and of differing services brought to him
                            rather than the views of his own service. <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Admiral Burke</persName> said he wanted to have all the angles
                            presented at the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> table. He cited
                            intelligence as an area in which, in one headquarters, he had seen a
                            whole staff section become nothing more than “yes men.”</p>
                        <p>The President said he thought each major command such as the Continental
                            Command, the Far East Command, the European Command, and the Strategic
                            Air Command should report directly to the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>. The services should be given orders to support these
                            commands. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> would study their
                            problems, taking account of all resources, and look to the joint staff
                            for assistance as to how to use the resources operationally.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Taylor</persName> said he thought
                            the real problem is a budgetary problem—to relate the Commander’s needs
                            to what can be provided from available funds. He thought the President’s
                            proposal required an overhaul of the existing commands. The President
                            said what he had in mind is that the Joint Chiefs could tell commanders
                            what is generally available. They could then work out the best use of
                            these resources.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_627" n="627" facs="0651"/>
                        <p>The President said he wanted the American people to have a complete faith
                            in the services—that is what he is working for. In consequence, he hates
                            to see the services rush into print, each trying to better its own
                            position, often at the expense of the others. As a result of this, the
                            American public has lost a large measure of confidence in the services.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> said we have
                            gotten to think the situation is quite bad. One reason is that we only
                            concentrate on the bad things. The essence of the problem is that each
                            service receives an appropriation from Congress. Each must then appeal
                            to the people and to the Congress. The key seems to be such an amount of
                            reorganization as would have appropriations made to the Defense
                            establishment, to be apportioned as to optimize our military forces in
                            terms of the threats facing us. The President said if there were just
                            one public relations office, that change alone would have a very great
                            benefit. He would like to see the step taken which would bring out that
                            the first and the great loyalty of all members of the defense
                            establishment is to the Defense Department, which means the United
                            States of America.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Austin<note n="4" xml:id="d154fn4">Vice Admiral Bernard L.
                                Austin, <gloss target="#t_USN1">USN</gloss>, Director, Joint Staff,
                                    <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>.</note> said that the joint
                            staff has sometimes served in just the way the President has in mind.
                            The Chiefs, when unable to agree, have on occasion asked, “What does the
                            joint team think?”</p>
                        <p>The President said he thinks the United States is disturbed over the
                            security situation. He does not want to be complacent about it, nor
                            hysterical. But he thinks that our people now believe the services are
                            more interested in the struggle with each other than against an outside
                            foe. He said the people in Defense must give their heart to national
                            interests and welfare. Mr. McElroy endorsed that. He said he would like
                            to see, for example, at service association meetings the presentation of
                            awards to members of other services. The President said that from the
                            time a man is picked to serve on the joint staff, he should have a
                            national spirit and outlook in all that he does.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Admiral Burke</persName> said he thought we
                            have a rough six months or so ahead of us. He said he thought the
                            Soviets would try to come forward with a series of events that would
                            capture the world’s attention, and will try to compromise the United
                            States all around the world with a series of charges and allegations. He
                            thought that they would seek to dictate solutions in the Middle East,
                            and attempt to play on the desires of minority groups. The President
                            said he had no difference with this view. He thought, however, that when
                            we are working on a broad front as we are, we must accept some “bulges”
                            from time to time. We ought to remember the diversity and number of our
                            accomplishments—our package power reactor, our many successful missiles,
                            our atomic submarines, etc. In addition, he said he was very clear in
                            his mind that there are many things we must do in the military,
                            scientific <pb xml:id="pg_628" n="628" facs="0652"/>and mutual security
                            field. In the face of this challenge, it is deeply disappointing to see
                            any of these top individuals devoting himself to his own service
                            interests. He thought we have come to the time when we must forget these
                            rivalries.</p>
                        <p>The President said he wanted to keep in close touch with the Chiefs and
                            the Secretaries. In December we plan to have meetings with Congressional
                            leaders. These will include a bipartisan meeting on foreign policy and
                                defense.<note n="5" xml:id="d154fn5">See <ref target="#d169">Document 169</ref>.</note> The President thought it was
                            essential that the group stay close together. They must stand firmly
                            behind a plan which, he realized, may not fully meet anyone else’s
                            desires. Once they have agreed to it, however, they should say this is
                            what <hi rend="italic">we</hi> believe. The President mentioned that he
                            is trying to achieve token reductions in departments such as
                            Agriculture, HEW, and nonmilitary activities of the Atomic Energy
                            Commission. He thought it was clear that requirements for defense will
                            continue to rise. He thought this action raises the obligation, however,
                            that if savings can be found in Defense, the group must be sure to make
                            them.</p>

                        <p>The Security Resources Panel of the <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss>
                            Science Advisory Committee submitted its report, “Deterrence and
                            Survival in the Nuclear Age,” to the meeting of the National Security
                            Council on November 7. Often called the Gaither Report after the name of
                            the committee’s chairman, H. Rowan Gaither, Jr., the study was one of
                            several authorized at the meeting of the National Security Council on
                            April 4 to investigate the relationship between a Federal shelter
                            program and other civil defense proposals.</p>
                        <p>According to the letter from the Steering Committee of the Security
                            Resources Panel transmitting the Gaither Report to the President, dated
                            November 7, “more than ninety persons of widely varying specialties and
                            experiences,” including advisers and staff, participated in the
                            committee’s work. The panel early decided that it “would not try for
                            invention but, rather, would concentrate on the many studies undertaken
                            by large and experienced groups, within our area of interest, both
                            within and outside the military, and to try to relate them to <pb xml:id="pg_629" n="629" facs="0653"/>our assignment.” Some members
                            of the panel were given “access to particularly sensitive studies and
                            Intelligence information, and the implications of these have influenced
                            our final judgments.”</p>
                        <p>Gaither had to withdraw in September from further active direction of the
                            panel because of ill health and was succeeded as director by Robert C.

                            Advisory Committee and made the preliminary presentation of the report

                            He indicated that, with those studies as background, the Council would
                            hear a presentation today of a study made over a period of several
                            months by the Security Resources Panel of <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss>’s Science Advisory Committee, which study deals with

                        <p>Dr. Robert D. Calkins, President of the Brookings Institution and member
                            of the Security Resources Panel, next provided an oral presentation of

                        <p>Mr. William C. Foster, Olin-Mathieson Chemical Corporation and member of
                            the Security Resources Panel, then made an oral presentation on the
                            elements of the Panel report relating to Management and
                            Organization.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Foster</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> offered brief concluding
                            remarks on behalf of all of the members of the Security Resources
                            Panel.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of the formal presentation General Cutler asked Mr.
                            Robert Lovett, as a member of the Advisory Panel, if he would say a
                            word. Mr. Lovett replied that while he had no authority to speak for
                            these old “re-treads” on the Panel, he believed that all of them
                            certainly agreed that the report which had been presented was a very
                            competent job. Moreover, the conclusions had been forced upon the
                            members of the group against their own liking and inclination. Their
                            conclusions presented a grim picture but there was light at the end of
                            the tunnel. There was a solution. This was cold comfort but nevertheless
                            comfort. While Mr. Lovett saw nothing too desperate in our present
                            situation, it was clear that urgency of U.S. action was very real
                            indeed.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that he was extremely sorry that insufficient
                            time had been provided for discussion and clarification of the Security
                            Resources Panel’s conclusions. Had time permitted, for example, he would
                            have liked to explore further the views of the Panel on the organization
                            of the Department of Defense. He was inclined to believe there was much
                            to be said for the Panel’s recommendation that <pb xml:id="pg_632" n="632" facs="0656"/>the Office of Defense Mobilization and the
                            Federal Civil Defense Agency be consolidated. Since there was so little
                            time for discussion the President added that we would want to call on
                            the members of the Security Resources Panel and the Advisory Group in
                            the future. The President then went on to further exploration of certain
                            matters. What he asked, can the American people be expected to put up
                            with in terms of the allocation of the Gross National Product over the
                            next several years? Was the Panel proposing to impose controls on the
                            U.S. economy now? After all, this Administration had gotten rid of
                            controls on the economy as soon as it came into office because of its
                            conviction that in the absence of controls the American economy would
                            develop more rapidly. Are we now to advocate the re-introduction of
                            controls? Enlarging on a comment made in the course of the presentation
                            about the 38-billion-dollar ceiling on the Defense Department program,
                            the President reminded those present that he had urged upon the Congress
                            appropriations amounting to 39.5 billion rather than 38 billion. In
                            spite of a number of meetings with members of Congress on the budget, in
                            spite of the fact that he had gone on television to urge the validity of
                            his proposed appropriation, Congress had nevertheless cut the
                            figure.</p>
                        <p>The President added that in the light of what had been presented at the
                            Council meeting today it was essential that we neither become panicked
                            nor allow ourselves to be complacent. It was necessary urgently to make
                            an economic, psychological, and political survey of what could and
                            should be done. In this context, perhaps the advent of Sputnik had been
                            helpful. The President added that we certainly did not wish to appear
                            frightened and he had received information today indicating that fear
                            had pervaded the population of the United States. The President believed
                            that we could correct this situation. The problem was whether we could
                            correct the tendency of every American to try to get the maximum for
                            himself out of the operation of our free economy. If we are going to
                            have to use controls on the economy, we had better impose them
                            promptly.</p>
                        <p>General Cutler then suggested that the Council hear from Mr. McCloy,
                            likewise a member of the Advisory Panel. Mr. McCloy stated that although
                            the figures presented in Mr. Webster’s presentation were indeed
                            impressive, particularly in terms of the human lives which might be
                            saved by a fall-out shelter program, he still had some reservations with
                            respect to the usefulness of the shelter program. With respect to the
                            question of the imposition of controls on the economy, Mr. McCloy
                            doubted that further controls would be needed in order to carry out the
                            improvement of <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> and our air defense
                            capabilities along the lines recommended by the Panel. With respect to
                            the shelter program (which presumably in Mr. McCloy’s opinion might
                            involve the necessity for controls), he suggested that he would like to
                            think <pb xml:id="pg_633" n="633" facs="0657"/>further about this matter
                            before reaching a decision. He also pointed out that he had himself not
                            personally been to the Headquarters of the Strategic Air Command and
                            accordingly he was obliged to take the word of others who had been as to
                            the vulnerability of <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>. However, if
                                <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> were in fact vulnerable, it must
                            certainly be made invulnerable. It was also Mr. McCloy’s impression that
                            shortcomings in the process of decision-making and inter-service
                            rivalries were acting as a brake on the progress of our defense effort.
                            Whether or not this was actually the case, the American public certainly
                            believed it to be.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion Mr. McCloy pointed out that even if the Administration
                            carried out all the defense recommendations proposed by the Security
                            Resources Panel, the United States would still find itself in a
                            situation of instability from the point of view of the political and
                            foreign policy sides of the problem. Our present situation called for an
                            imaginative domestic political program and an imaginative foreign
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>The President indicated his inclination to agree with Mr. McCloy’s
                            comments on inter-service rivalries and the decision-making process in
                            the Department of Defense. He then referred to the great difficulties
                            which he was encountering in preparation for his speech over television
                            this evening.<note n="8" xml:id="d156fn8">See <ref target="#d159">Document 159</ref>.</note> There were so many details to be
                            considered for inclusion in the speech that it was extremely hard to see
                            how they could be fitted in while at the same time meeting the required
                            emphasis and the changing situation.</p>
                        <p>The President then stated that he wished Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> to speak to the Council on the
                            effects of some of the Panel’s recommendations on our foreign policy and
                            on the attitude of our Allies. The President was concerned about the
                            effect of the development by the United States of a great shelter
                            program when our Allies would have no such program themselves.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> commented that in
                            his last remark the President had already suggested what he, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, wanted to say. The
                            presentation by the Security Resources Panel had dealt with one aspect
                            of the problem facing the United States, namely, the military problem,
                            but the military aspect was only one part of the problem and problem
                            must be viewed in its entirety. Our struggle against the Soviet Union
                            was not solely military nor were the results of the struggle dependent
                            wholly on the military measures taken by the United States. It should be
                            remembered that the Soviet Union had made its greatest gains in terms of
                            taking over other peoples and other areas during the years from 1945 to
                            1950 when the United States was more <pb xml:id="pg_634" n="634" facs="0658"/>powerful than it had ever been before in peacetime and
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had not made any appreciable
                            gains even though they now had great nuclear capabilities and general
                            military capacity.</p>
                        <p>As to the impact on our Allies of the United States embarking on a great
                            shelter program, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            thought that if we were to do so and our Allies could not do the same,
                            we could surely write off all of our European Allies. It might be argued
                            theoretically that the United States as the arsenal of the Free World
                            requires the protection of shelters but to say that the American people
                            must be saved from the effects of radiation and not the British and the
                            French and the others was tantamount to losing our Allies.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then returned to
                            the point that our struggle with the Soviet Union and international
                            communism was not just a military struggle. Up to now it has been
                            primarily a cold war. Accordingly, there was great danger that we should
                            so focus our eyes on the military aspects of the struggle that we lose
                            the cold war which is actually being waged, forgetting that an actual
                            military conflict may never be waged. The Soviet Union could make
                            enormous gains in the economic struggle between us if the United States
                            devotes so much of its resources to military measures and shelter
                            programs that no resources remain for waging and winning the cold
                            war.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> concluded by
                            emphasizing that one point made by the Panel he most emphatically
                            endorsed. The United States must maintain a deterrent capability, a
                            capacity to damage the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to such a
                            degree that the Soviets will be unwilling to start a war. This
                            capability we must preserve at all costs. With such a deterrent
                            capability, together with the resources needed to wage the cold war, we
                            would be in a position to conduct our foreign policy in such a manner as
                            to assure victory in the cold war.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that if those present were a group sitting in the
                            Kremlin, we would probably adopt the recommendations and program of the
                            Security Resources Panel in toto, regardless of the effect of such
                            action on our people. As it was, however, we could not do this. We have
                            before us a big job of molding public opinion as well as of avoiding
                            extremes. We must get the American public to understand that we are
                            confronting a tough problem but one that we can lick. The President
                            concluded by pointing out that as consideration of the Panel’s report
                            proceeded, we would want to be talking again with the members of the
                            Panel who had drawn up this report.</p>
                        <p>Thereafter General Cutler outlined in a general way what he thought would
                            be suitable Council action with respect to the Panel’s report.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of the meeting the President said he believed it would
                            be interesting to make a test to find out how long the matters which had
                            come before the Council this morning could be kept secret.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_635" n="635" facs="0659"/>
                        <p>He also said that he could not thank the Security Resources Panel and its
                            Advisory Group enough for the marvelous piece of work they had done.</p>
                        <p>General Cutler then requested the Statutory Members of the National
                            Security Council and certain others, including Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Foster</persName>, to join the President in his office for a brief

                            classified information which he had received from Headquarters,
                            Strategic Air Command on the following subjects:</p>
                        <p>(1) The relatively small number of <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>
                            planes which (on a recent date when <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>
                            was not in one of its various states of Alert) could have taken off on
                            an attack strike within the probable tactical warning time. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> said that <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>, since the date in question, had made
                            improvements in the number of planes which could take off but that this
                            was a vulnerability which needed to be corrected urgently.</p>
                        <p>(2) The increased Soviet defenses which made it more difficult for any
                            given number of <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> planes to reach
                            Soviet targets. This difficulty was somewhat offset by the fact that
                            even if <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> planes were intercepted over
                            Soviet territory before reaching their targets, their nuclear weapons
                            would still be detonated and cause fall-out on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> explained that he
                            presented this information as an explanation in support of the
                            recommendations by the Security Resources Panel as to the urgent need
                            for reducing <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> vulnerability and
                            improving <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> reaction time.</p>

                            expressed to the President the view that I felt that these possibilities
                            were so remote in practice that I doubted whether we would be justified
                            in going to the extremes in the way of cost that alertness would
                            require. The possibility considered was that in a time of relative
                            tranquillity and a reduction of international tension there would be
                            mounted a massive surprise attack against the United States and
                            simultaneously against all our important bases.</p>
                        <p>I said I considered that such an attack without provocation involving
                            casualties of perhaps one hundred million would be so abhorrent to all
                            who survived in any part of the world that I did not think that even
                            rulers would dare to accept the consequences.</p>

                            aftermath, taking into account probable new weapon systems; and to
                            suggest which of the various active and passive measures are likely to
                            be most effective, in relation to their costs. While fulfilling its
                            assignment, the Panel was also asked to study the deterrent value of our
                            retaliatory forces, and the economic and political consequences of any
                            significant shift of emphasis or direction in defense programs.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_640" n="640" facs="0664"/>
                        <p>The Panel has therefore examined active and passive defense measures from
                            two standpoints: their contribution to deterrence; and their protection
                            to the civil population if war should come by accident or design.</p>
                        <p>We have found no evidence in Russian foreign and military policy since
                            1945 to refute the conclusion that <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            intentions are expansionist, and that her great efforts to build
                            military power go beyond any concepts of Soviet defense. We have,
                            therefore, weighed the relative military and economic capabilities of
                            the United States and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in
                            formulating our broad-brush opinions, basing our findings on estimates
                            of present and future Russian capabilities furnished by the Intelligence
                            community.</p>
                        <p>The evidence clearly indicates an increasing threat which may become
                            critical in 1959 or early 1960. The evidence further suggests the
                            urgency of proper time-phasing of needed improvements in our military
                            position vis-à-vis Russia. A time table distinguishing four significant
                            periods of relative military strengths is given in detail in Appendix
                            A.</p>
                        <p rend="center">II. Nature of the Threat</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Economic</p>
                        <p>The Gross National Product (<gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>) of the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is now more than one-third
                            that of the United States and is increasing half again as fast. Even if
                            the Russian rate of growth should decline, because of increasing
                            difficulties in management and shortage of raw materials, and should
                            drop by 1980 to half its present rate, its <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> would be more than half of ours as of that date. This
                            growing Russian economic strength is concentrated on the armed forces
                            and on investment in heavy industry, which this year account for the
                            equivalent of roughly $40 billion and $17 billion, respectively, in 1955
                            dollars. Adding these two figures, we get an allocation of $57 billion
                            per annum, which is roughly equal to the combined figure for these two
                            items in our country’s current effort. If the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> continues to expand its military expenditures
                            throughout the next decade, as it has during the 1950’s, and ours
                            remains constant, its annual military expenditures may be double ours,
                            even allowing for a gradual improvement of the low living standards of
                            the Russian peoples.</p>
                        <p>This extraordinary concentration of the Soviet economy on military power
                            and heavy industry, which is permitted, or perhaps forced, by their
                            peculiar political structure, makes available economic resources
                            sufficient to finance both the rapid expansion of their impressive
                            military capability and their politico-economic offensive by <pb xml:id="pg_641" n="641" facs="0665"/>which, through diplomacy,
                            propaganda and subversion, they seek to extend the Soviet orbit. (See

                        <p>The Soviet military threat lies not only in their present military
                            capabilities—formidable as they are—but also in the dynamic development
                            and exploitation of their military technology. Our demobilization after
                            World War II left them with a great superiority in ground forces, but
                            they had no counter in 1946 for our Strategic Air Force nor for our
                            Navy. They had no atomic bombs, no productive capacity for fissionable
                            materials, no jet engine production, and only an infant electronics
                            industry. This situation was compatible with a then-backward country, so
                            much of whose most productive areas had suffered military attack and
                            occupation. Their industrial base was then perhaps one-seventh that of
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>The singleness of purpose with which they have pressed their
                            military-centered industrial development has led to spectacular
                            progress. They have developed a spectrum of <gloss target="#t_A1">A</gloss>- and H-bombs and produced fissionable material sufficient
                            for at least 1500 nuclear weapons. They created from scratch a
                            long-range air force with 1500 B–29 type bombers; they then
                            substantially re-equipped it with jet aircraft, while developing a
                            short-range air force of 3000 jet bombers. In the field of ballistic
                            missiles they have weapons of 700 <gloss target="#t_nm1">n.m.</gloss>
                            range, in production for at least a year; successfully tested a number
                            of 950 <gloss target="#t_nm1">n.m.</gloss> missiles; and probably
                            surpassed us in <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> development. They
                            have developed air-to-surface and probably submarine-launched cruise
                            missiles; built 250 to 300 new long-range submarines and partially
                            modernized 200 others. They have created an air defense system composed
                            of 1500 all-weather and 8500 day jet fighters; equipped at least 60
                            sites, each with 60 launchers, for a total of over 3600 launching pads
                            for surface-to-air missiles provided with a sophisticated and original
                            guidance system and a ground environment of 4000 radars. At the same
                            time, they have maintained and largely re-equipped their army of 175
                            line divisions, while furnishing large quantities of military equipment
                            to their satellites and Red China.<note n="5" xml:id="d158fn5">By the

                        <p>The Panel has arrived at the following broad-brush opinions as to the
                            present situation:</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_642" n="642" facs="0666"/>
                        <p>A. In case of a nuclear attack against the continental United States:</p>
                        <p>1. Active defense programs now in being and programmed for the future
                            will not give adequate assurance of protection to the civil population.
                            If the attack were at low altitude, or at high altitude with electronic
                            countermeasures (jamming), little protection would be afforded. If the
                            attack should come at moderately high altitude and without electronic
                            countermeasures, some considerable protection will be afforded the civil
                            population.</p>
                        <p>2. Passive defense programs now in being and programmed for the future
                            will afford no significant protection to the civil population.</p>
                        <p>B. The protection of the United States and its population rests,
                            therefore, primarily upon the deterrence provided by <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>. The current vulnerability of <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> to surprise attack during a period of
                            lessened world tension (i.e., a time when <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> is not on a <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> “alert”
                            status), and the threat posed to <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> by
                            the prospects of an early Russian <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                            capability, call for prompt remedial action.</p>
                        <p>The Panel has arrived at the following conclusions as to the value,
                            relative to cost, of various measures for protecting the civil
                            population.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Measures To Secure and Augment Our Deterrent
                            Power</p>
                        <p>Since the prevention of war would best protect our urban population, we
                            assign the highest relative value to the following measures to secure
                            and augment our deterrent power. These would protect our manned bombers
                            from surprise attack, increase our forces available for limited military
                            operations, and give us an earlier and stronger initial operational
                            capability (<gloss target="#t_IOC1">IOC</gloss>) with intermediate-range
                            and intercontinental ballistic missiles. Basic elements in this program
                            are:</p>
                        <p>1. To lessen <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> vulnerability to a
                            Russian surprise bomber attack in a period of low tension (a present
                            threat):</p>
                        <p>a. Reduce reaction time so an adequate number (possibly 500) of <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> planes can get off, weapons aboard, on
                            way to target, within the tactical warning time available. This can be
                            done by promptly implementing <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>’s
                            “alert” concept.</p>
                        <p>b. Improve and insure tactical warning. Radars in the seaward extensions
                            need to be modernized to assure tactical warning at high and low
                            altitude, and the extensions need to be lengthened to prevent “end
                            runs.”</p>
                        <p>c. provide an active missile defense for <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> bases (Nike–Hercules or Talos) against bombers.</p>
                        <p>2. To lessen <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> vulnerability to an
                            attack by Russian <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s (a late 1959
                            threat):</p>
                        <p>a. Develop, to an operational status, a radar early-warning system for an
                                <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> attack.</p>
                        <p>b. Further improve <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>’s reaction time to
                            an “alert” status of 7 to 22 minutes, depending on location of
                            bases.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_643" n="643" facs="0667"/>
                        <p>c. Disperse <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> aircraft, to the widest
                            extent practical, to <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> and non-<gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> military bases in the ZI and possibly
                            also to commercial airfields in the ZI.</p>
                        <p>d. Protect a large part of <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>’s planes
                            by providing 100 to 200 psi shelters, and equivalent protection for
                            weapons, personnel, and other needed supplies and facilities.</p>
                        <p>e. Provide <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> bases with an active
                            missile defense against <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s, using
                            available weapons such as Nike-Hercules or Talos and the improved
                            long-range tracking radars now existing in prototype.</p>
                        <p>3. To increase <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>’s strategic offensive
                            power (to match Russia’s expected early <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> capability):</p>
                        <p>a. Increase the initial operational capability of our <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>s (Thor and/or Jupiter) from 60 to
                            240.</p>
                        <p>b. Increase the <gloss target="#t_IOC1">IOC</gloss> of our <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s (Atlas and Titan) from 80 to
                            600.</p>
                        <p>c. Accelerate the <gloss target="#t_IOC1">IOC</gloss> of the Polaris
                            submarine <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> system, which offers the
                            advantages of mobility and greatly reduced vulnerability.</p>
                        <p>d. Every effort should be made to have a significant number of <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>s operational overseas by late 1958,
                            and <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s operational in the ZI by late
                            1959.</p>
                        <p>e. Hardened bases for the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s should
                            be phased in as rapidly as possible.</p>
                        <p>4. Augment our and Allied forces for limited military operations, and
                            provide greater mobility, to enable us to deter or promptly suppress
                            small wars which must not be allowed to grow into big ones. he Panel
                            suggests that a study be undertaken, at the national rather than at a
                            Service level, to develop current doctrine on when and how nuclear
                            weapons can contribute to limited operations.</p>

                            and Cities</p>
                        <p>The main protection of our civil population against a Soviet nuclear
                            attack has been and will continue to be the deterrent power of our armed
                            forces, to whose strengthening and securing we have accorded the highest
                            relative value. But this is not sufficient unless it is coupled with
                            measures to reduce the extreme vulnerability of our people and our
                            cities. As long as the U.S. population is wide open to Soviet attack,
                            both the Russians and our Allies may believe that we shall feel
                            increasing reluctance to employ <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> in
                            any circumstance other than when the United States is directly attacked.
                            To prevent such an impairment of our deterrent power and to ensure our
                            survival if nuclear war occurs through miscalculation or design, we
                            assign a somewhat lower than highest value, in relation to cost, to a
                            mixed program of active and passive defenses to protect our civil
                            population.</p>
                        <p>1. A massive development program to eliminate two major weaknesses in our
                            present active defenses:</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_644" n="644" facs="0668"/>
                        <p>a. The vulnerability of the radars in our ground environment and in our
                            weapons control to “blinding” by enemy electronic countermeasures
                                (<gloss target="#t_ECM1">ECM</gloss>).</p>
                        <p>b. The small probability of kills against a low-level attack.</p>
                        <p>2. Further strengthening of our active defenses as soon as their
                            vulnerability to <gloss target="#t_ECM1">ECM</gloss> and low-level
                            attack is removed. Current research affords hope that at least our
                            weapons-control radars can be made proof against <gloss target="#t_ECM1">ECM</gloss>. Radars can be located at high points to guard against
                            low-level attacks, and a barrage-type defense against low-level attacks
                            from the sea might prove a stopgap. An effective air defense system is
                            so important to ensure continuity of government, and to protect our
                            civil population, our enormously valuable civil property and military
                            installations, that these development programs we suggest should be
                            pushed with all possible speed.</p>
                        <p>3. A nationwide fallout shelter program to protect the civil population.
                            This seems the only feasible protection for millions of people who will
                            be increasingly exposed to the hazards of radiation. The Panel has been
                            unable to identify any other type of defense likely to save more lives
                            for the same money in the event of a nuclear attack.</p>
                        <p>The construction and use of such shelters must be tied into a broad
                            pattern of organization for the emergency and its aftermath. We are
                            convinced that with proper planning the post-attack environment can
                            permit people to come out of the shelters and survive. It is important
                            to remember that those who survive the effects of the blast will have
                            adequate time (one to five hours) to get into fallout shelters. This is
                            not true of blast shelters which, to be effective, must be entered prior
                            to the attack.</p>
                        <p>We do not recommend major construction of blast shelters at this time.
                            If, as appears quite likely, an effective air defense system can be
                            obtained, this will probably be a better investment than blast shelters.
                            However, because of present uncertainties, on both active and passive
                            fronts, it appears prudent to carry out promptly a research ana
                            development program for such blast shelters since we must be in a
                            position to move rapidly into construction should the need for them
                            become evident.</p>
                        <p>A more detailed statement of the Panel’s findings on passive defense is
                            included as Appendix B.</p>
                        <p>4. A program to develop and install an area defense against <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s at the earliest possible date.</p>
                        <p>5. Increased emphasis on the R&amp;D program to improve the Navy’s
                            anti-submarine effort, including defense against submarine-launched
                            missiles. The principal protection against these latter may have to be
                            provided by air and ballistic missile defense systems.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Improvement of Management of Defense
                            Resources</p>
                        <p>The Panel has been impressed with the supreme importance of effective
                            control and management of the resources allocated to defense.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_645" n="645" facs="0669"/>
                        <p>The new weapons systems, in cutting across traditional Service lines,
                            have caused management problems which have been difficult to resolve
                            within existing legislative and organizational restrictions. We have
                            lost ability to concentrate resources, to control performance and
                            expenditures, and to change direction or emphasis with the speed that a
                            rapidly developing international situation and rapidly developing
                            science and technology make necessary.</p>
                        <p>We are faced by an enemy who is able, not only ruthlessly to concentrate
                            his resources, but rapidly to switch from one direction or degree of
                            emphasis to another.</p>
                        <p>A radical reorganization of the Department of Defense might cause such
                            confusion, at least temporarily, as to weaken our defense. However, some
                            immediate steps to more effective control and management of our defense
                            resources are urgently needed and appear practicable.</p>
                        <p>Some such steps can be taken without new legislation and certainly they
                            would be timely, even before the return of Congress in January. A
                            further step would appear to be a decision within the Executive Branch
                            to seek from Congress the amendment of present legislation, which
                            freezes the organization of the Defense Department along lines that may
                            have been appropriate before the evolution of present weapons systems,
                            but which are clearly inappropriate today and may become intolerable in
                            the near future.</p>
                        <p>Changes in the Defense organization might take the following lines:</p>
                        <p>1. An increased focusing of responsibility and authority in operational
                            commands, with missions appropriate to integrated weapons systems.</p>
                        <p>2. The concentration of research and development responsibilities for the
                            two or three major integrated and complete weapons systems in manageable
                            organizational units.</p>
                        <p>3. A more effective concentration of the military departments and
                            departmental staffs upon training and logistics.</p>
                        <p>4. More direct command channels between the Secretary of Defense and the
                            operational commands.</p>
                        <p>5. A command post-type staff, responsible directly and solely to the
                            Secretary of Defense to assist him, both in the essentially managerial
                            task of control and command, and in the long-term planning his
                            responsibilities require.</p>
                        <p>a. Such a staff should be organized as a staff, not as an interagency
                            committee. Policy should be established to encourage the objectivity of
                            officers serving on such a staff; and rotation would enable them to keep
                            abreast of appropriate developments bearing on the mission.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_646" n="646" facs="0670"/>
                        <p>b. Officers serving on such a staff should be selected and relieved
                            directly by the Secretary of Defense. Satisfactory service on this staff
                            should, as on certain other joint staffs, meet one of the preliminary
                            requirements needed for consideration for promotion.</p>
                        <p>Through such evolutionary development, the functions of planning,
                            budgetary control, and operational command could increasingly be brought
                            together and responsibility focused and delegated, rather than
                            bucked.</p>
                        <p>The Panel further believes that coordination in depth between the Defense
                            Department and those responsible for other aspects of our national
                            policy, particularly the State Department, can be improved, especially
                            in the field of forward planning.</p>
                        <p>Existing plans to protect and care for people in the event of attack have
                            become obsolete as a result of the growing threat, and are therefore
                            ineffective. Provisions for relocating government officials and for
                            evacuating civilians are unrealistic in many respects. The plans of many
                            states and metropolitan areas for handling local police, fire, health,
                            water, sanitation and related problems are primitive in many areas.</p>
                        <p>Protection of the civil population is a national problem requiring a
                            national remedy. We urge the re-evaluation of the existing
                            organizational structure that distributes responsibilities among the
                            Office of Defense Mobilization, the Federal Civil Defense
                            Administration, the military, and state and local governments.</p>

                        <p>Strategic warning—information obtained and correctly interpreted prior to
                            the actual launching of an enemy attack on the United States—would be of
                            immense value to this country. Further, it will become even more
                            valuable as the maximum achievable tactical warning time shrinks to a
                            matter of minutes in the case of a missile attack. At present, however,
                            we have no assurance that strategic warning will be received.</p>
                        <p>We have too few solid facts on which to base essential knowledge of
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> capabilities and too few solid
                            facts to learn how they are changing with time. From such observations,
                            intentions may often be deduced. More positive and direct intelligence
                            of <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> activities and accomplishments
                            can be obtained by vigorous use of presently known techniques and
                            available methods.</p>
                        <p>Because of their utmost importance to our actual survival, we urge
                            exploitation of all means presently at our disposal to obtain both
                            strategic warning and hard intelligence, even if some risks have to be
                            taken, together with the vigorous development of new techniques.</p>

                            population should be made part of a broad program to improve the
                            security and political position of the Free World as a whole, in accord
                            with the enlightened self-interest of the United States.</p>
                        <p>If not so integrated into our foreign policy, any substantial program to
                            reduce the vulnerability of the United States might be widely
                            interpreted as signaling a retreat to “Fortress America.” The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would be sure to fully exploit the

                        <p>Such an integrated program might include:</p>
                        <p>1. Measures, some of which are already under way, to pool and make more
                            effective the economic, technological and political resources of
                            ourselves and our allies.</p>
                        <p>2. Supplying <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> with nuclear weapons,
                            to remain in U.S. custody in peacetime, for use in wartime under <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> command—as a means of increasing
                            confidence.</p>
                        <p>3. Measures designed to assure the uncommitted nations that their
                            national interests are truly a matter of continuing concern to us.</p>
                        <p>Such an integrated and comprehensive program could significantly raise
                            the level of hope, confidence and strength in the Free World, and could
                            give renewed prospect of securing Russian agreement to safe arms control

                        <p>The added defense measures to which the Panel has assigned relative
                            values will probably involve expenditures in excess of the current $38
                            billion defense budget.</p>
                        <p>The measures of highest value, to strengthen our deterrent and offensive
                            capabilities, are estimated to cost over the next five years (1959–1963)
                            a total of $19 billions.</p>
                        <p>Additional measures of somewhat lower than highest value, for the
                            protection of the civil population, include a strengthening of active
                            defenses, a fallout shelter program, and the development of a defense
                            system to protect cities from missile attack. The estimated costs of
                            these items total $25 billions over the next five years.</p>
                        <p>More detailed cost estimates are shown in Appendix C. To initiate the
                            measures of highest value will cost $2.87 billions in 1959; and $3.0 to
                            $5.0 billions per annum in the following four years. The entire program,
                            including the lower-than-highest-value additional measures, would cost
                            approximately $4.73 billions in 1959, and annual expenditures rising to
                            a peak of $11.92 in 1961 and dropping to $8.97 billions in 1963. Several
                            of these measures will involve further outlays in excess of operating
                            and maintenance costs after 1963.</p>

                        <p>These several defense measures are well within our economic capabilities.
                            The nation has the resources, the productive capacity, and the
                            enterprise to outdistance the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in
                            production and in defense capability. This country is now devoting 8.5%
                            of its production to defense, and 10% to all national security programs.
                            The American people have always been ready to shoulder heavy costs for
                            their defense when convinced of their necessity. We devoted 41% of our
                                <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> to defense at the height of
                            World War II and 14% during the Korean War. The latter percentage is
                            somewhat higher than would be required to support all our proposals.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. Economic Consequences</p>
                        <p>The additional expenditures for measures of highest value are barely
                            within the estimated receipts from existing taxes in the first three
                            years, and more definitely within estimated receipts thereafter,
                            assuming continued and uninterrupted high employment and growth. To the
                            extent that economies can be achieved in existing defense or non-defense
                            programs, the increase in total expenditures could be minimized. An
                            increase in the debt limit would be necessary. This would be a
                            precautionary measure against the possibility that revenues may
                            initially fall below the estimates based on high employment and because
                            expenditures normally run ahead of revenues during a portion of the
                            fiscal year.</p>
                        <p>The demands of such a program (measures of highest value) on the nation’s
                            economic resources would not pose significant problems. Aside from its
                            psychological impact, increased defense spending would have some
                            influence on capital investment. If a moderate recession is impending,
                            tax receipts would decline, but the increase in Federal expenditures
                            would help to sustain production and employment. Under conditions of
                            full employment, the program would have some inflationary effects,
                            requiring a continuation of monetary and credit restrictions.</p>
                        <p>To undertake the whole program of active and passive measures would
                            involve outlays of $4.8 to $11.9 billions per annum over the next five
                            years, and further unestimated expenditures thereafter. Except as
                            economies can be achieved in defense and non-defense expenditures, these
                            sums would represent additions to the Federal budget.</p>
                        <p>Large additional expenditures of this sort are still within the economic
                            capabilities of the United States. They would necessitate, however, an
                            increase in taxes, a somewhat larger Federal debt, substantial economies
                            in other government expenditures, and other curbs on inflation.
                            Additional private investment would be required, especially to carry out
                            the shelter program which would impose heavy requirements <pb xml:id="pg_649" n="649" facs="0673"/>for steel, cement and labor. In
                            all probability, this program would necessitate some slow-down of
                            highway construction and other postponable public works.</p>
                        <p>The early announcement of such a program would be a stimulus to the
                            economy and would have an inflationary influence. Measures to cope with
                            the inflationary problem posed by such an increase in defense spending
                            should be planned as part of the program.</p>
                        <p rend="center">VI. Public Education and Political Consequences</p>
                        <p>The Panel urges an improved and expanded program for educating the public
                            in current national defense problems, in the belief that the future
                            security of the United States depends heavily upon an informed and
                            supporting public opinion. We have been heartened by the recent
                            announcement that positive steps will be taken to initiate what we hope
                            will be a broad and sustained program of such education. We must act now
                            to protect, for this and succeeding generations not only our human and
                            material resources, but our free institutions as well. We have no doubt
                            of the will and capacity of the American people to do so if they are
                            informed of the nature and probable duration of the threat and if they
                            understand what is required of them. Only through such enlightenment and
                            understanding can we avoid the danger of complacency and the enervation
                            of our inherent strengths.</p>
                        <p rend="center">VII. Deterrence and Survival</p>
                        <p>The measures advocated by the Panel will help to unite, to strengthen and
                            to defend the Free World, and to deter general war which would expose
                            our cities and bases to thermonuclear attack. They would improve our
                            posture to deter or promptly to suppress subversion or limited war,
                            which may be more likely in the years immediately ahead. No one of these
                            lesser enemy moves might directly threaten our survival. Yet, if
                            continued, they might nibble away the security of the Free World as
                            Germany undermined the superior military power of Great Britain and
                            France between 1936 and 1939.</p>
                        <p>If deterrence should fail, and nuclear war should come through
                            miscalculation or design, the programs outlined above would, in our
                            opinion, go far to ensure our survival as a nation.</p>
                        <p>To illustrate the urgency of prompt decision and rapid action, we submit
                            in Appendix A a time table of relative strengths under our present
                            programs and the assumed Russian programs. As this appendix indicates,
                            the United States is now capable of making a decisive air nuclear attack
                            on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could make a very destructive attack
                            on this country, and <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> is still
                            vulnerable to a surprise attack in a period of lessened world tension.
                            As soon as <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> acquires an <pb xml:id="pg_650" n="650" facs="0674"/>effective “alert” status, the
                            United States will be able to carry out a decisive attack even if
                            surprised. This could be the best time to negotiate from strength, since
                            the U.S. military position vis-à-vis Russia might never be so strong
                            again.</p>
                        <p>By 1959, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> may be able to launch
                            an attack with <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s carrying megaton
                            warheads, against which <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> will be
                            almost completely vulnerable under present programs. By 1961-1962, at
                            our present pace, or considerably earlier if we accelerate, the United
                            States could have a reliable early-warning capability against a missile
                            attack, and <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> forces should be on a 7
                            to 22 minute operational “alert.” The next two years seem to us
                            critical. If we fail to act at once, the risk, in our opinion, will be
                            unacceptable.</p>

                        <p>5. Although Russia will probably add to her inventory of long-range jet
                            bombers during this period, the small number of these produced in recent
                            months and the apparent lack of air-refueling of her large number of
                            medium jet bombers indicate the Soviets are probably taking a calculated
                            risk during this period and are shifting a large part of their national
                            effort from manned bombers to long-range ballistic missiles.</p>

                        <p>1. A surprise attack by either <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> or
                                <gloss target="#t_SUSAC1">SUSAC</gloss> in a period of lessened
                            world tension might almost completely disarm the other’s long-range air
                            atomic strike capability, unless and until either side has successfully
                            implemented an adequate “alert” concept.</p>
                        <p>2. During this period, a surprise attack could determine the outcome of a

                        <p>3. As soon as <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> acquires an effective

                        <p>2. U.S. will probably not have achieved such a capability.</p>
                        <p>3. U.S. will probably not have achieved either an early warning of or
                            defense against an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> attack.</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> will have increased modestly its

                        <p>5. Rapid increase in <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> stockpile of
                            fissionable material and in weapons technology will substantially
                            increase megaton load that can be delivered by manned bombers in the
                            U.S.</p>
                        <p>6. In spite of continuing additions to our continental defense net, the

                        <p>2. If the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> were successful in a

                        <p>2. If all missile and bomber bases had also been hardened, the

                            larger megaton warheads and quicker reaction time, will be put into

                            destruction; and there will be a continuing race between the offense and
                            the defense. Neither side can afford to lag or fail to match the other’s
                            efforts. There will be no end to the technical moves and

                        <p>1. The net megaton attack which each side could deliver through the
                            other’s defenses might destroy approaching 100 per cent of the urban
                            population, even if in blast shelters, and a high percentage of the
                            rural population unless it were protected by fallout and blast shelters.
                            An attack of this size and devastation would result in less than
                            one-tenth the radiation required for world contamination.</p>

                        <p>Active defense cannot alone provide adequate protection to the civilian
                            population. Even if most of the attacking weapons could be shot down,
                            there would still be a major hazard from fallout. Passive defense will
                            materially reduce casualties. The precise number differs widely with the
                            type of program, the weight and pattern of attack, and the effectiveness
                            of active defense.</p>
                        <p>The Panel has considered passive defense as a two-pronged<note n="7" xml:id="d158fn7">We have also examined such alternatives as

                            examined in the context of the post-attack environment to see if, after
                            varying conditions of attack, the sheltered population might reasonably
                            expect to emerge into a situation permitting survival and

                        <p>The many shelter plans examined by the Panel indicate that broad
                            protection can be provided, and that the cost varies fairly directly
                            with the effectiveness of the program. All programs are expensive, as
                            might well be expected, since the cost of a nationwide effort is
                            calculated by multiplying an amount in dollars per person by the two
                            hundred million people we will be protecting in 1966. As a natural
                            consequence, the programs must be kept simple, even spartan, to cut down
                            on the cost per person. Safety, not comfort, is the keyword. Last, we
                            emphasize a common aspect of all programs: none offers absolute
                            protection, and even with a prohibitively expensive program we must
                            anticipate heavy casualties if we are attacked.</p>
                        <p>We have centered consideration on a series of four programs ranging from
                            fallout shelters alone through combinations of blast shelters and
                            fallout shelters described in Fig. B–1.<note n="8" xml:id="d158fn8">Not

                                time, is conceivable in the distant future; and this, if not
                                intercepted at a distance, could lay down such a level of radiation
                                that very large areas could, as a practical matter, be unusable for
                                a period of years. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> The middle
                            curve (Attack B—medium weight—divided between military and civilian
                            targets—2500 megatons on target) shows that about half the population
                            would be casualties were they completely without protection.</p>
                        <p>A program of fallout shelters for everyone would cost about $25 billion
                            and would save nearly half the casualties. Such a program would be
                            equally or more effective in saving lives (perhaps fifty million) under
                            an attack directed entirely at military targets.</p>
                        <p>It does not appear that any practicable addition to our defense,
                            regardless of cost, can offer so much of a return under as wide a
                            variety of conditions. (For example, their use is not dependent on
                            warning, since they may be entered from one to five hours after attack.
                            Further, fallout shelters are not outmoded by the transition from bomber
                            to missile attacks.) As a bonus, such a program of fallout shelters
                            would have a significant additional advantage of permitting our own air
                            defense to use nuclear warheads with greater freedom.</p>
                        <p>If an adequate active defense system cannot be devised, we may have to
                            turn to blast shelters to reduce further the severe—and probably
                            unacceptable—casualty list with fallout shelters only. A program that
                            might reduce the casualties under this same Attack B to about 10% of the
                            population will cost $20 to $30 billions more, depending on the level of
                            protection furnished.</p>
                        <p>Blast shelters present substantially more difficult problems than do
                            those designed for fallout alone. Not enough is known of the design
                            problems, nor is there sufficient test experience, to be able to plan a
                            nationwide system of such structures without further extensive research
                            and development. Typical of the factors that complicate planning for
                            blast shelters are the decisions of locating them<note n="11" xml:id="d158fn11">And the elaborate public training required if they

                            shorter time that will be available for the population to reach shelters
                            as <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s come into use.</p>
                        <p>We have examined cost estimates on many shelter programs and find a wide
                            variation. The general figures used herein are comparable to those used
                            in the Interdepartmental Report and seem to represent a reasonably
                            attainable figure at the 1957 price level. The cost given for <pb xml:id="pg_655" n="655" facs="0679"/>any of these programs would
                            include provision of over $10 billions’ worth of equipment and the
                            supplies to maintain the sheltered population for approximately two to
                            three weeks.</p>
                        <p>The question of how fast to build any shelters involves balancing the
                            1959 need against the desire to spread out the expense so as to avoid
                            overloading our construction facilities and our capacity to produce
                            construction materials. Perhaps five years for a fallout program would
                            be an appropriate compromise; any blast shelter program would need to be
                            spread over a longer period.</p>
                        <p>Any shelter program must presumably be accompanied by:</p>
                        <p>1. A strong program of organization and management of the construction
                            phases to take advantage of all possible means of reducing costs by
                            proper scheduling of manpower and materials and by efficient
                            production-line techniques.</p>
                        <p>2. A program providing the necessary trained leadership and trained
                            emotional and physical behavior in the general public requisite for
                            their successful psychological and physical survival under shelter
                            conditions and the aftermath.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Survival in the Aftermath</p>
                        <p>Our investigation of the post-attack environment has involved study of
                            radiation levels, food supply, water, agriculture, transportation,
                            utilities, communications, etc. Unquestionably, conditions may be harsh,
                            increasingly so with each heavier level of attack assumed to penetrate
                            our defenses. It appears, however, for the foreseeable future that
                            sheltered survivors could pull through and remake a way of life in our
                            own country.</p>
                        <p>Such a prediction presupposes careful planning, training and a strong
                            central organization to handle both the attack and the post-attack
                            situations. And—more important—it presupposes that the pre-and
                            post-attack planning and organization have been done in parallel, with
                            recognition, for example, that industrial preparedness is a necessary
                            complement to any shelter program.</p>
                        <p>Far too tittle is really known about the recuperative powers of our
                            industrial economy, and even less of the actual minimum requirements of
                            the population surviving an attack. It is certain that there must be
                            stockpiling of essential survival items to serve the surviving
                            population for six to twelve months. In addition, the construction of
                            additional hardened dispersed plants in a few critical industries (such
                            as drugs and liquid fuels) is imperative. These seem problems of
                            planning and ingenuity rather than items of major expense.</p>
                        <p>It seems that, for six or eight years, the safeguarding of industrial
                            plant capacity should not be an overriding problem. But in the light of
                            the heavier blows that are conceivable in the later 1960’s, and
                            particularly <pb xml:id="pg_656" n="656" facs="0680"/>with a
                            well-sheltered population, certain programs should be begun now to
                            protect industrial facilities vital to the survival of this larger
                            surviving population.</p>
                        <p>We feel it important that, concurrent with other survival plans, a strong
                            program of appropriate medical research be undertaken. This will cost
                            relatively little money; it could have great peacetime value in any
                            case; and, in the event of actual attack, the results of such work might
                            prevent literally millions of casualties from becoming fatalities.</p>

                            defense without shelters. This conclusion rests on the assumption that
                            the two major weaknesses in our active defenses can and will be
                            eliminated.</p>
                        <p>A year from now, the value and cost of still further expansion of air
                            defense can better be weighed against the relative value of blast
                            shelters. Additional active air defense appears now to offer a more
                            favorable prospect of preventing casualties for no more money than a
                            blast shelter program would cost, and, further, would save industry and
                            structures.</p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that intensive research and development is probably
                            needed before commencing major blast shelter construction, it seems wise
                            to defer any decision regarding blast shelters for a year, during which
                            time a research and development program would be initiated, and
                            presumably the necessary job of augmenting our active air defense would
                            continue.</p>
                        <p>Of itself, a shelter program would, in the Panel’s opinion, forcibly
                            augment our deterrent power in two ways: first, by discouraging the
                            enemy from attempting an attack on what might otherwise seem to him a
                            temptingly unprepared target; second, by re-inforcing his belief in our
                            readiness to use, if necessary, our strategic retaliatory power.</p>
                        <p>Further, a shelter program might symbolize to the nation the urgency of
                            the threat and would demonstrate to the world our appraisal of the
                            situation and our willingness to cope with it in strength. It would
                            symbolize our will to survive, and our understanding of our
                            responsibilities in a nuclear age.</p>

                        <p>Needless to say, the benefits that can derive from an intelligent and
                            coordinated passive defense program are realizable only in the context
                            of a superior over-all organization, charged with responsibility for the

                        <p>The early acquisition by <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> of an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> capability and the implementation of
                            an <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> capability overseas will
                            greatly increase this country’s offensive posture and deterrent
                            strength.</p>
                        <p>An integrated program of Atlas and Titan, and an <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> program including the achievement of a significant
                            operational capability at the earliest possible date, should be given
                            the highest national priority. It does not appear unreasonable nor too
                            great a risk to consider at this time a rapid build-up of <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>s and their deployment on overseas
                            bases if they can be obtained. With a major effort, it appears possible
                            to have at least one squadron in place during the last quarter of 1958,
                            and 16 squadrons in place overseas before the end of 1960. Such a time
                            scale would require decisions in the near future, some additional funds
                            and an intensive training program in order to provide operational crews
                            as rapidly as the missiles become available.</p>
                        <p>It appears possible to plan a build-up of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s in the order of 60 squadrons (600 missiles) by the
                            end of Fiscal 1963. The <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s will
                            probably become available during 1959. The limiting factor in their
                            deployment (assuming that no major technical difficulties are
                            encountered) will be the rate at which launching sites and crews are
                            made ready. The first site could become operational in 1959. The speed
                            of build-up is adjustable over a wide range if one is prepared to take
                            some risk now.</p>
                        <p>Except for the initial Atlas group, all <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> bases should incorporate hardening against the Soviet
                                <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> threat.</p>
                        <p>The Polaris submarine-based weapon system, with its great mobility and
                            security from attack, will be a valuable addition to a mixed strategic
                            offensive force. Strong support should also be given to this program in
                            order to speed up the first planned operational capability for 1963 by
                            at least a year, and to increase the planned force of six submarines for
                            1965 by approximately a factor of three. A mixed offensive force
                            complicates the defense of an enemy and increases his uncertainty.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_658" n="658" facs="0682"/>
                        <p>The Polaris missile will be a solid-fuel rocket which makes it a much
                            more desirable weapon than the early <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>s for overseas deployment. It appears that the design
                            of this missile for land-based use could be completed by early 1959 if
                            desired. We believe that it is important to achieve this capability at
                            the earliest possible time.</p>
                        <p>When this missile becomes available it might be phased into the
                            liquid-fuel <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> program</p>

                        <p>An active continental defense system must contend with three different
                            threats: manned bombers, intercontinental ballistic missiles, and
                            submarine-launched missiles. Each of these poses its own peculiar
                            problems for defense, and each requires alerting for optimum operation.
                            Defense and warning systems to contend with the submarine threat and the
                            bomber threat exist, and are scheduled for improvement. However, these
                            now have and, as presently planned, will continue to have limited
                            capabilities. Design concepts exist for a variety of anti-ballistic
                            missile defense and warning systems. But no operational units have as
                            yet been built or tested.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The present and planned system for providing tactical warning of enemy
                            manned bombers approaching the continental United States has serious
                            limitations which can be corrected. This problem has been studied in
                            detail by a subcommittee of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Ad Hoc Committee
                            on Air Defense of North America, and an excellent report presented 30
                            June 1957.</p>
                        <p>In general we are concerned that:</p>
                        <p>a. The early-warning radar network is our principal means of collecting
                            warning data on aircraft to permit two or more hours’ warning, which is
                            absolutely essential in the near future (e.g., for the protection of
                                <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>). However, the complete network
                            is not scheduled to be operational until mid-1960; and, even at this
                            date, much of the network will be equipped with obsolete equipment.</p>
                        <p>b. Even when completed, the presently planned system can be flanked with
                            distressing ease, considering Soviet capabilities.</p>
                        <p>c. The presently operational seaward extensions have very poor radar
                            coverage. A significant improvement is immediately feasible.</p>
                        <p>d. Identification and raid-size determination techniques are weak but can
                            readily be improved.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_659" n="659" facs="0683"/>
                        <p>e. Research on warning devices has lacked direction and emphasis. The
                            search for new and improved techniques should be pressed with vigor.
                            Infra-red techniques should receive particular attention.</p>
                        <p>We have no reason whatsoever to feel complacent about the effectiveness
                            of our warning system. The cost of warning is small, its value is very
                            real, and provision of the degree of warning required is well within our
                            technical abilities.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The continental air defense system as it now exists, and as it is now
                            planned to be, does not and will not provide this country with a
                            significant level of protection. It has a number of “Achilles’ heels”
                            which can be exploited by an intelligent enemy. It is ineffective in the
                            face of electronic countermeasures, saturation tactics, and low-altitude
                            attacks. We believe that it is possible, with a determined effort, to
                            improve this situation markedly by 1961, and to have a highly effective
                            air defense system by 1963. It is our belief that it would take only a
                            moderate increase in total Defense Department budget, properly spent, to
                            make a large improvement in the air defense system. But when we examine
                            the history of air defense, we conclude that an effective air defense
                            system is unlikely within the present organization framework. The lack
                            of clear-cut single assignment of responsibility for weapons
                            development, systems design, and implementation has allowed
                            vulnerabilities to persist long after they were recognized. It is
                            imperative that a competent technical group be given the responsibility
                            for planning a balanced defense system in the light of continually
                            changing technology and the continually changing threat. By the very
                            nature of the problem we face, this group must be heavily technical with
                            military support, as opposed to the present concept of being heavily
                            military with technical advice.</p>

                            Thule and Fairbanks. An orderly program is recommended; however, in
                            addition, we now believe that a crash program to provide some warning at

                        </p>
                        <p>Several systems have been proposed which appear to have capability of
                            intercepting ballistic missile warheads at sufficient distances to
                            prevent their doing serious damage. These systems fall into two distinct
                            categories.</p>
                        <p>The first group are systems assembled from air defense components such as
                            Nike-Hercules, or Talos, and existing long-range radars. These proposed
                            early systems offer a reasonably high defense capability for points such
                            as <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> bases against the early threat,
                            but do not have the capability needed to provide protection for extended
                            areas. In addition, early <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                            interception would occur at moderate altitudes— on the order of of
                            30,000 feet or less—so there is danger of damage to the population and
                            structures from blast and heat. Because these systems are assembled from
                            existing components requiring only moderate modification, a limited
                            operational capability could be available in early 1960, with complete
                                <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> base defense in 1962. These
                            defenses would also have a capability against bombers and thus would
                            prevent sneak attacks.</p>
                        <p>The other group of proposed missile defense systems aims to intercept the
                            incoming warheads at much higher altitudes. To do this in the face of
                            decoys poses a number of technical questions, the answers for which
                            require a high-priority research and test program. However, the
                            importance of providing active defense of cities or other critical areas
                            demands the development and installation of the basic elements of a
                            system at an early date. Such a system initially may have only a
                            relatively low-altitude intercept capability, but would provide the
                            framework on which to add improvements brought forth by the research and
                            test programs.</p>

                            anti-submarine efforts should be greatly augmented, particularly in
                            research and development. For the immediate future it seems that the
                            principal protection against submarine-launched missiles will have to be
                            provided by the air defense and ballistic missile defense systems. The
                            submarine-launched missile threat imposes several additional
                            requirements on the design of such systems. A submarine-launched missile
                            defense system is required to acquire targets over a wide range of
                            angles; and the warning time available to alert the system is
                            considerably less—less even than is available against the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>. However, it may be noted that at
                            least one of the missile defense systems mentioned above has been
                            conceived with these requirements in mind.</p>

                        <p>In conclusion, we feel that planning and performance in active defense
                            are inadequate. However, we believe that an adequate defense is feasible
                            and, furthermore, that active defense is an essential part of the
                            national military posture. The active defense system must be balanced,
                            e.g., even in the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> era, the manned
                            bomber will remain an important threat.</p>

                        <p>From the President’s office on November 7, at 8 p.m., <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight D. Eisenhower</persName> delivered a radio
                            and television address to the American people on science and national
                            security. In his talk <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
                            discussed the present security posture of the United States in light of
                            the Soviet Union’s successful launching of an earth satellite (Sputnik
                            I) on October 4, and future problems involving American scientists and
                            their relationship to the enlarged effort within the Federal government
                            in the fields of science, technology, and missiles. For text of the

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> also reported
                            several steps he had taken to utilize the expertise of the scientific
                            community in government programs. He mentioned first the creation of the
                            office of Special Assistant to the President for Science and Technology,
                            and the acceptance of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">James R.
                                Killian</persName>, President of the Massachusetts Institute of
                            Technology, to fill this position. He also announced that the Department
                            of Defense would establish a Guided Missile Director directly
                            responsible to the Secretary of Defense to establish missile policy and
                            prevent administrative and interservice disruptions in the missile
                            program. The Department of Defense immediately created the Office of the
                            Division of Guided Missiles. William M. Holaday, who had been serving as
                            Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Guided Missiles, became the
                            Director.</p>
                        <p>Subsequently, on November 22, <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> approved the transfer of the Science Advisory
                            Committee of the Office of Defense Mobilization to the White House,
                            reconstituting and enlarging it as the President’s Science Advisory
                            Committee. The purpose of this action was to promote a more direct
                            relationship among the President, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName>, and the committee.</p>

                        <p>Mr. McElroy said that the Defense budget had been prepared on a basis of
                            guidelines for $38 billion totals for <gloss target="#t_NOA1">NOA</gloss> and for expenditures. Service allocations are $8.6
                            billion for the Army, $10.5 billion for the Navy, and $18.1 billion for
                            the Air Force, with $0.8 billion for Department-wide activities.
                            Beginning and end strength personnel figures for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 59, in thousands, are, for the Army 900 and 850, for the
                            Navy 645 and 630, for the Marines 188 and 170, and for the Air Force 875
                            and 850, for a total of 2.5 million personnel.</p>
                        <p>The President recalled that part of the theory in going down to 2.5
                            million was that through increased compensation, and resulting better
                            reenlistment rates, we could save on training establishments. Mr.
                            McElroy recalled that we have not provided the increased compensation as
                            yet, and it is not included in the $38 billion. He said there are
                            several areas, including this one, where it seemed that we should do
                            something over and above the $38 billion. These would include $700
                            million next year for the Cordiner program,<note n="2" xml:id="d160fn2">See <ref target="#d145fn3">footnote 3, Document 145</ref>.</note>
                            which he considered should be phased in over a four-year period, and for
                            a 6% average increase for civilians, for those military personnel
                            receiving less than that under the Cordiner proposals, and for retired
                            personnel. Mr. McElroy said he had not provided for increases in prices
                            for procurement that might occur. Also, he had provided for development
                            of missiles on a research basis, but not for maximum procurement. This
                            seemed generally reasonable in that we have not reached this point in
                            our deployment plans, in the proving out of the weapons, or in
                            negotiations with allies. However, he thought we could assume successful
                            development of the <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> as of a certain
                            date, and successful negotiations by that date, and safely go ahead with
                            a scheduled buildup of operational capability. For the Jupiter/Thor, he
                            thought we should aim at a schedule to attain cumulative strengths of
                            one squadron (of 15 missiles) in 1959, 4 in 1960, 8 in 1961, 12 in 1962,
                            and 16 in 1963. To do this would require $150 million additional in
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 59. With regard to the Polaris, by
                            accepting 85% of design performance we could markedly <pb xml:id="pg_663" n="663" facs="0687"/>accelerate the program. This
                            would involve $135 million additional in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 59 for development costs, and $250 million <gloss target="#t_NOA1">NOA</gloss> additional for two missile submarines,
                            each with 16 missiles.</p>
                        <p>To carry forward, and accelerate, <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>
                            dispersal, and reduction of reaction time, including alert and other
                            measures, he would like to add about $200 million to the $100 million
                            now in the program for these purposes.</p>
                        <p>In the area of satellite development, $100 million is included in the Air
                            Force budget for work on the reconnaissance satellite. He felt that we
                            should set up an additional $100 million for space development,
                            including a manned missile.</p>
                        <p>He also had a proposal for increased antisubmarine capabilities, since we
                            think that if we block off a big war we may need the means for a smaller
                            one. No specific figure was mentioned and there did not seem to be
                            consensus as to the priority of this project.</p>
                        <p>The President said he has a growing suspicion that the carrier has about
                            run its course. He thinks that the atomic missile submarines make a
                            great deal of sense but that the carrier may be passing to a lower level
                            of significance. He recognized that great controversy and protest must
                            be expected on this. He accepted that we will need carriers against
                            certain types of attack but felt that the threat to them of the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> with hydrogen weapons is very great.
                            The carrier forces require a great expanse of sea for their operations,
                            and cannot be hidden in the Mediterranean. Hence, they would be
                            immediately vulnerable to destruction. He said he asks himself the
                            question constantly what the guided missile substitutes for. He feels it
                            takes the place of artillery and manned bombers, but does not displace
                            them completely. As of now he feels that the big bomber is the greatest
                            deterrent to major war, and feels the same about the carrier, but
                            considers that this is phasing out.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McElroy commented that in a situation like Syria or other crises in
                            the Orient, people are very greatly impressed by a carrier show of
                            force. The President raised the question of the life of our present
                            carriers. He thought they should be good for something like another 15
                            years if simply modernized and kept up to date. He did not see valid
                            reason for laying down any new carriers, and felt the old ones could be
                            used for the missions requiring carriers.</p>
                        <p>The President said he thought the two most important things in the
                            additional proposals were the pay increase and the proposal for
                            dispersal and alert of <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>, including
                            hangars and extra crews. He said there are several things we must do—we
                            must keep <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> alert and dispersed, we
                            must keep up our 15 carriers, and we must build submarines. He asked
                            what the future level of annual outlay for the <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>s would be if the additional funds now proposed were
                            provided—would the costs not go up and up or would they remain the same
                            as <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 59. <pb xml:id="pg_664" n="664" facs="0688"/>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> said
                            they would keep at about the same level as <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 59. The President stressed that there is nothing
                            sacrosanct about the $38 billion figure, and that he thought allowances
                            could and should be made for important additional programs. He asked
                            whether Mr. McElroy is putting the reconnaissance satellite and the
                            further satellite research and development under one man at the Defense
                            level, and Mr. McElroy said this is what they are considering.</p>
                        <p>The President then went on to say that if Defense gets these additions
                            they must be prepared to give up such things as excessive executive
                            aircraft, etc. He thought they could certainly find $600 million or more
                            this way. Then he felt we could do what needs to be done for
                            approximately $39 billion or $39.5 billion. If the budget were carefully
                            prepared he thought we could defend a budget that stays below $40
                            billion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McElroy said there is also some question as to whether we can do what
                            the military authorities think we should do in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and in Korea with the reduced force strengths. The
                            President thought considerable reductions can be made through
                            streamlining, but that we cannot reduce our combat units there
                            (referring to Army units). Mr. McElroy said he may wish to ease up some
                            on the Army manpower cuts in Europe and Korea, perhaps allowing 20,000
                            additional personnel for this purpose.</p>
                        <p>He said he would put the figures up to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> on the basis of a $38 billion budget. The President
                            said he should then say what he thought might be the deficiencies—such
                            as <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> dispersal and alert; improved
                            pay; acceleration of missiles (which he is prepared to accept, but which
                            he does not want to go beyond his and Mr. McElroy’s own good judgment).
                            Mr. McElroy said the proposal for missile acceleration does not seem
                            excessive as a pace. The President said the reconnaissance satellite
                            could be added, and then there should be a balancing off of some
                            savings, perhaps resulting in a budget of about $39.5 billion.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> thought it might
                            be well to let the Chiefs and the Secretaries present some of the needs,
                            and the President accept them. The President said he would accept such a
                            procedure, but is really working for the time when the Department comes
                            in with a unified plan. He would like to see the Chiefs come in agreed
                            on the priorities for additions; for example, they ought to agree on
                                <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> dispersal, Cordiner proposals,

                        <p rend="center">The Problem</p>
                        <p>To review significant developments affecting the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>’s internal political situation, relations with Bloc
                            states, economic situation, military programs, and foreign policy, and
                            to estimate probable Soviet courses of action through 1962.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Summary Estimate</p>
                        <p>1. Both the Soviet internal scene and Soviet external policy continue to
                            be strongly marked by change and innovation. The ascendance of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has further accentuated the
                            flexibility and pragmatism of the post-Stalin leaders’ approach to their
                            major problems. But none of the changes in Soviet policy suggests any
                            alteration in basic aims or in the concept of an irreconcilable conflict
                            between the Communist and non-Communist worlds. Indeed the Soviet
                            leaders display a great deal of confidence, buttressed by their recent
                            political and technological successes, in the prospects for ultimate
                            victory of their side.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Trends in Soviet Foreign Policy</p>
                        <p>2. The respect of the Soviet leaders for US nuclear power will continue
                            and they are unlikely to initiate general war or to pursue courses of
                            action which, in their judgment, gravely risk general war, over the next
                            five years. At the same time, however, they are probably confident that
                            their own growing nuclear capabilities, added to their great
                            conventional strength, are increasingly deterring the US and its allies
                            from courses of action gravely risking general war. As a result the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> probably regards itself as
                            progressively achieving greater freedom of maneuver in local
                                situations.<note n="2" xml:id="d161fn2">Footnote in the source text
                                not declassified.</note>

                        <pb xml:id="pg_666" n="666" facs="0690"/>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>’s posture during the Suez and
                            Syrian crises convinces us that the use of threats will remain a basic
                            element in Soviet policy. At times the Soviet leaders will probably
                            bring the threat of Communist military strength into the open by
                            menacing words or harsh diplomatic exchanges. Moreover, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> might go considerably further in
                            certain situations—e.g., by supporting indigenous Communist or other
                            forces in local military action, or even sending Soviet “volunteers,”
                            judging that grave risk of general war would not result. Thus the risks
                            of general war arising through miscalculation may increase.</p>
                        <p>3. But in general the Soviet leaders will probably continue to prefer
                            non-military means of achieving their objectives. They probably regard
                            the present world situation as ripe to develop further in their favor
                            through continuation of such tactics. While determined to build up their
                            armed strength against any eventuality, the present leaders have
                            probably decided that a continuation of “peaceful co-existence” will
                            best assure against the risks of nuclear conflict and at the same time
                            offer far-reaching opportunities to weaken and divide the Western powers
                            and to promote Soviet influence in the key underdeveloped areas of the
                            world.</p>
                        <p>4. Almost certainly the Soviet leaders expect further crises as the
                            interests of the two great power groupings clash in the Middle East and
                            elsewhere. They will take a strong line in such crises. Yet we believe
                            that in general they will continue to emphasize such tactics as
                            high-level goodwill visits, broadened contacts, promotion of cultural
                            and other exchanges, expanded foreign trade, long-term credits and
                            technical assistance, and arms aid. Their aim will be to cause further
                            blurring of the lines between the Communist and non-Communist worlds and
                            to undermine and cause a retraction of Western, especially US, strength
                            from around the periphery of the Bloc.</p>
                        <p>5. The Soviets will almost certainly intensify their efforts to woo the
                            underdeveloped countries, particularly in Asia and Africa, in order to
                            estrange them from the West and to lay the groundwork for growing Soviet
                            influence. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has the economic
                            resources for considerably expanding its “trade and aid” campaign, while
                            its extensive stocks of obsolescent arms will permit it to capitalize
                            further on the desires of many underdeveloped countries to strengthen
                            themselves vis-à-vis their neighbors.</p>
                        <p>6. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> clearly regards the chief
                            immediate opportunities for expanding its influence to lie in the Middle
                            East. It is shrewdly supporting Arab nationalism against the West and
                            thereby attempting to avoid the appearance of seeking undue political
                            influence of its own. It is also conscious of the extent to which vital
                            Western interests are involved in the area, and of the risks which would
                            arise from a direct test of strength between the great powers
                            themselves. Nevertheless, its <pb xml:id="pg_667" n="667" facs="0691"/>longer run aims are to eliminate Western military power and political
                            influence from the area, to attain a position from which to control
                            Middle East oil, and ultimately to dominate the area.</p>
                        <p>7. During the next few years the chief Soviet objective in Western Europe
                            will be to weaken and divide the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            powers and above all to induce a withdrawal of US military strength. To
                            this end the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will continue to
                            promote some form of European security treaty to replace both <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the Warsaw Pact. But the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will almost certainly remain adamant
                            on German reunification on any terms except its own, however much this
                            may limit its maneuverability in Western Europe.</p>
                        <p>8. As a means of forwarding their peaceful co-existence policy and of
                            advancing their efforts to neutralize US nuclear striking power, the
                            Soviets will seek on the whole to give the appearance of a flexible and
                            constructive attitude on disarmament. They probably desire some form of
                            simple “first-stage” agreement with minimum inspection and control but
                            we remain convinced that they will reject comprehensive inspection and
                            controls.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Trends in Soviet Relations With Other Communist
                            States</p>
                        <p>9. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>’s reluctant acceptance of a
                            degree of Polish autonomy and of Yugoslavia’s special position, as well
                            as its recognition of Communist China’s stature and role within the
                            Bloc, indicates a continuing belief that some greater flexibility in
                            Soviet relations with other Communist states is both necessary and
                            desirable in order to preserve and strengthen the Bloc. However, mindful
                            of last year’s developments in Poland and Hungary, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> now seems determined to go slow in
                            any further evolution of its relationships with the European Satellites,
                            and above all to avoid any repetition of the Hungarian or even Polish
                            experiences. It would almost certainly revert to repressive policies in
                            event of serious threats to its position in Eastern Europe, Barring such
                            developments, we think the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will
                            pursue a cautious policy of economic aid, adjustment to national
                            peculiarities, and toleration here and there of a somewhat greater
                            degree of Satellite autonomy.</p>
                        <p>10. The strong identity of interest among the various Bloc regimes, their
                            dependence upon Soviet aid and support, and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>’s overwhelming military power will tend to maintain
                            the essential solidarity of the Bloc over at least the next five years.
                            But the underlying forces released by developments since Stalin’s death
                            will persist, creating further instability within the Satellites.
                            Additional changes in intra-Bloc relations are likely.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_668" n="668" facs="0692"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Internal Developments</p>
                        <p>11. Two of the major problems posed by Stalin’s death have persisted: who
                            is to rule, and how is the ruling to be done. While Stalin’s successors
                            agreed on fundamental objectives—maintenance of Party dictatorship,
                            continued military buildup, and rapid economic growth—they differed as
                            to the policies best suited to pursue these aims in the conditions of
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> today. These differences in
                            turn complicated the problem of who was to rule, rendering the
                            leadership unstable.</p>
                        <p>12. Now, after four years of uneasy collective leadership, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has emerged as dominant.
                            Although he still lacks the degree of power achieved by Stalin through
                            the use of police terror, he has disposed of his major rivals and
                            asserted Party mastery over the economic bureaucracy and the military.
                            These developments have probably enhanced the stability of the Soviet
                            leadership, though this leadership will be subject to continuing strain
                            over the next several years as difficult policy problems arise. We think
                            that only the most severe problems could threaten the present leadership
                            arrangements, but, considering the magnitude of the problems which the
                            regime faces, and the risks of failure in the bold programs which
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has undertaken,
                            issues of such gravity could arise. In such an event <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would probably move toward
                            absolute rule, if necessary attempting to reinstitute terror for this
                            purpose. But important elements among the elite groups would be alert to
                            and would probably oppose such a development, particularly if a recourse
                            to terror were involved.</p>
                        <p>13. As to the question of how to rule, the present leadership has shown
                            awareness of the need to overcome the alienation of the Soviet
                            population which has been caused by fear and deprivation and expressed
                            in apathy. Instead of a widespread use of terror, which in the end might
                            not spare the leaders themselves, another approach was felt to be
                            necessary in order to keep the society cohesive and responsive to
                            central direction. In addition, a shift in emphasis to the use of
                            incentives and the encouragement of initiative seemed to give promise of
                            increasing Soviet strength, particularly in the economic field.</p>
                        <p>14. This approach has been extensively applied to the Soviet economy. A
                            series of administrative reforms has sought to make better use of
                            specialist knowledge, local talent, and individual initiative. The
                            latest and largest of these is a radical reorganization of industry
                            which seeks to transfer to officials on the spot more powers in the
                            detailed execution of national policy. The incentive program
                            particularly in agriculture, aims not only at stimulating higher labor
                            productivity but also at increasing popular support for the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> regime. The <pb xml:id="pg_669" n="669" facs="0693"/>highly ambitious housing and
                            agricultural programs will probably be successful enough to provide a
                            gain of perhaps as much as one-fifth in per capita consumption over the
                            next five years.</p>
                        <p>15. The achievement of such a gain would probably produce some increase
                            in popular support, but a consumption program of this size will compete
                            more sharply than heretofore with requirements for industrial investment
                            and defense. This competition has already been partly responsible for
                            the abandonment of the Sixth Five-Year Plan (1956–60) in favor of a
                            seven-year plan for 1959–65. The issue of competing priorities, however,
                            has not been finally settled by this action and is certain to arise
                            again.</p>
                        <p>16. Most of the changes which have occurred bear the stamp of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>; given his self-confidence
                            and flexibility, the outlook is for further experimentation so long as
                            he remains in power. By and large, we believe that his policies will be
                            successful in generating more positive support among the population and
                            in stimulating a further substantial growth in over-all Soviet power
                            over the next five years. But his changes have created tensions and
                            forces in Soviet society, the ultimate impact of which is difficult to
                            foresee. The policy of a cautious relaxation applied in the intellectual
                            field, for example, has had disagreeable consequences for the regime.
                            Wider contacts with foreign countries have opened the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to disturbing influences. Youthful
                            nonconformity is an increasing problem, and a number of critical writers
                            are spreading among a small but increasing circle of readers a climate
                            of dissatisfaction and of impatience with the pace of official reforms.
                            The regime has made little progress in its counterattack upon these
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>17. Moreover, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s
                            expansion of the Party’s role as the chief instrument for managing the
                            reform process places a heavy load upon it. With the downgrading of the
                            secret police, the Party apparatus has assumed new responsibilities for
                            insuring political conformity; with the abolition of most economic
                            ministries it now has a much larger role in carrying out centrally
                            determined economic policies. If the Party proves inadequate to these
                            tasks, the prospects for success of the regime’s ambitious economic and
                            political programs will be greatly diminished.</p>
                        <p>18. The role of the party becomes even more critical when viewed in a
                            perspective extending beyond the period of this estimate. For the next
                            five years at least, the regime’s totalitarian controls over the Soviet
                            people almost certainly will not be seriously compromised. But over the
                            longer run it is far from certain that the Soviet citizen can be
                            educated to a higher level, urged to exercise his own initiative, given
                            increasing opportunity for comparisons with other countries, and
                            encouraged to expect a significant improvement in his living standard,
                            and at the same time submit without question to a leadership which <pb xml:id="pg_670" n="670" facs="0694"/>incessantly proclaims, and
                            frequently exercises, the right to make all important decisions for him,
                            regardless of his personal desires. Eventually it may turn out that the
                            benevolent totalitarianism which Stalin’s successors seek to achieve is
                            an impossible contradiction and that the forces released in the search
                            for it will require the leadership to revert to earlier patterns of
                            control or to permit an evolution in some new direction. Even the latter
                            changes would not necessarily alter the basic threat which a dynamic
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> poses to the Free World.</p>

                        <p>19. Notwithstanding the many problems confronting the Soviet leaders, we
                            foresee a further rapid growth in the chief physical elements of Soviet
                            power over the next five years. Particularly notable will be the
                            continued rapid expansion of the Soviet economy, further scientific and
                            technical advances in a wide variety of fields, and a continued build-up
                            and modernization of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>’s already
                            massive military strength.</p>
                        <p>20. <hi rend="italic">Economic Growth</hi>. Soviet economic growth over
                            the next five years will continue to be faster than that of the US,
                            though somewhat slower than during the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1951–55),
                            chiefly because of some redirection of investment and a declining of
                            growth in the labor force. We estimate the average growth in Soviet
                                <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> as around six percent annually
                            during the next five years. In dollar terms Soviet <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> would rise from about 40 percent of US
                                <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> in 1956 to about 45 percent in
                            1962. However, estimated Soviet defense expenditures, in dollar terms,
                            are already about equal to those of the US.</p>
                        <p>21. <hi rend="italic">Scientific and Technical Progress.</hi> The rapid
                            expansion of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>’s technical and
                            scientific capabilities, critical to the growth of Soviet industrial and
                            military power, will also continue. Although total Soviet scientific
                            capabilities may not equal those of the US, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has been able to make comparable achievements and to
                            forge ahead in certain areas of critical military and industrial
                            significance by concentrating its efforts in these fields. The number of
                            university level graduates employed in scientific and technical fields
                            already exceeds that in the US, and probably will be about 40 percent
                            greater than that in the US by 1962.</p>
                        <p>22. <hi rend="italic">Military Strength</hi>. Of outstanding significance
                            has been the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>’s progress in the

                        <p>b. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has probably tested an

                            estimate that it could have a few (say 10) prototype <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s available for operational use in
                            1959 or possibly even earlier, depending <pb xml:id="pg_671" n="671" facs="0695"/>upon Soviet requirements for accuracy and

                            available a 1000 <gloss target="#t_nm1">n.m.</gloss>

                        <p>23. Meanwhile, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will probably
                            continue to maintain a balanced and flexible structure of strong naval,
                            air, and ground forces, supplementing these with new weapons.
                            Nevertheless, the manpower strength of the Soviet forces appears to have
                            been reduced considerably from Korean War peaks, and some further
                            reductions and streamlining are likely, though not to a substantial
                            degree.</p>
                        <p>a. We estimate that the Soviet long-range bomber force has grown to some
                            1,500 bombers at present, though it includes a larger number of jet
                            medium bombers and fewer heavy bombers than we had previously estimated.
                            While we think that this force will not change significantly in size
                            during the period of this estimate, we believe that it will be further
                            strengthened by the replacement of obsolete Bull piston medium bombers
                            with jets, by the introduction of additional heavy bombers, and by
                            further development of inflight refueling. However, any estimate of
                            future strength must be highly tentative, especially for heavy bombers,
                            since Soviet policy in these respects is still shrouded in doubt.
                            Subject to such qualifications, we estimate that the Soviets may by
                            mid-1960 have about 400–600 heavy bombers and tankers of jet and
                            turboprop types, in a long-range air force totaling something between
                            1400 and 1700 bombers. We also estimate that the number of heavy bombers
                            and tankers will probably remain fairly steady after 1960, while the
                            total long-range bomber strength will probably decline slightly.<note n="4" xml:id="d161fn4">The Assistant Chief of Staff, Intelligence,

                                have a more substantial intercontinental attack capability,
                                providing for greater strategic flexibility and a much larger
                                capability for re-attack—in short, a force which would provide the
                                Soviets a greater chance of success in general war—while they are
                                working to acquire an additional nuclear delivery capability with

                                believes that the 400–600 heavy aircraft estimated above would all
                                be bombers and that by mid-1961 there will be 300–500 additional

                            improved fighter performance, a higher proportion of improved
                            all-weather fighters, better radar and communications equipment, and
                            widespread employment of improved surface-to-air and air-to-air
                            missiles.</p>
                        <p>c. The Soviet ground forces have been extensively reorganized and
                            modernized; further improvements in firepower and mobility are likely
                            during 1958–62. Training and doctrine are being adapted for modern
                            warfare, nuclear as well as non-nuclear. We still estimate <pb xml:id="pg_672" n="672" facs="0696"/>about 175 line divisions, [22
                                <hi rend="italic">words not declassified</hi>]. Increasing attention
                            is being paid to airborne and air-transportable forces, whose
                            capabilities will increase considerably by 1962.</p>
                        <p>d. The Soviets are engaged in an extensive naval program, especially in
                            the submarine category. There are recent indications that a shift to new
                            designs of submarines may be in progress. Their submarine force is
                            estimated at about 475 at mid-1957, including nearly 300 submarines of
                            modern design. We estimate that the submarine force will approximate 560
                            submarines by mid-1962. The first submarine propulsion reactor could now
                            be available, and by mid-1962 the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            could probably produce about 20 nuclear-powered submarines. A few
                            converted missile-launching submarines could now be in operation; and by
                            mid-1962 the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> may have a total of
                            50 in all categories of submarines equipped with guided missile
                            armament.</p>

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> opened the meeting
                            by informing the Council that it was to hear a briefing of the annual
                            report submitted by the Net Evaluation Subcommittee of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>, pursuant to the directive recommended
                            by the Council and approved by the President on May 24, 1956 (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5605). Under the terms of the
                            aforementioned directive, the Subcommittee was established as part of a
                            permanent procedure “to provide integrated evaluations of the net
                            capabilities of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, in the event
                            of general war, to inflict direct injury upon the continental United
                            States and to provide continual watch for changes which would
                            significantly alter its net capabilities.” General Cutler identified <pb xml:id="pg_673" n="673" facs="0697"/>the members of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Subcommittee as follows: General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName>, Chairman; the
                            Director, Office of Defense Mobilization; the Chairman, Atomic Energy
                            Commission; the Federal Civil Defense Administrator; the Director of
                            Central Intelligence; and the Chairmen of the Council’s Internal
                            Security Committees. He also referred to the Subcommittee’s Staff
                            Director, appointed by the President, General Gerald C. Thomas, <gloss target="#t_USMC1">USMC</gloss> (Ret.).</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then introduced the
                            Chairman of the Subcommittee, General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName>, who in turn introduced General Thomas.</p>
                        <p>General Thomas summarized the Subcommittee’s terms of reference as
                            outlined in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5605 noting that the
                            report covered the period through mid-1960. He added that, although the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was not credited with an
                                <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> capability in this year’s
                            report, the Russians will indeed have a substantial <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> capability in 1960, according to
                            reliable reports recently received by the Subcommittee. General Thomas
                            indicated that in its war-gaming for purposes of this year’s report, the
                            Subcommittee omitted overseas bases, confining itself, insofar as U.S.
                            forces were concerned, to continental U.S. elements. He indicated that
                            at the outset the Subcommittee Staff prepared auxiliary terms of
                            reference and basic assumptions consistent with <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5605. These terms and assumptions facilitated the
                            making of a realistic evaluation of U.S. and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> capabilities and vulnerabilities. After outlining the
                            Subcommittee’s general approach to the problem, General Thomas mentioned
                            briefly the several agencies which contributed to and otherwise
                            participated in the preparation of this year’s Net Evaluation
                            Report.</p>
                        <p>General Thomas next introduced Brig. General W. W. Smith, <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>, the Deputy Director of the
                            Subcommittee Staff. General Smith outlined in detail the basic
                            assumptions on which this year’s net evaluation exercise was based.
                            These included the assumption that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would initiate war against the U.S. in mid-1960.
                            Proceeding on that assumption, the Subcommittee had war-gamed the attack
                            on the basis of its being perpetrated: (a) with no warning (strategic
                            surprise), and (b) with full warning (full alert) and with U.S. forces
                            on maximum sustainable alert.</p>
                        <p>General Smith thereafter outlined the auxiliary assumptions on which this
                            year’s evaluation was based. These included, but were not limited to,
                            the following: <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would have adequate
                            bases from which to launch an attack; they would have adequate refueling
                            capability; they would be willing to expend some of their aircraft by
                            assigning them to one-way missions; their nuclear warheads would be set
                            to detonate on impact if the carrying aircraft were shot down; some of
                            their submarines would have guided missile capabilities; they would risk
                            strategic surprise in order to outflank the <gloss target="#t_DEW1">DEW</gloss> Line; they would not engage in large-scale clandestine
                            attack, etc. Insofar as the <pb xml:id="pg_674" n="674" facs="0698"/>U.S. is concerned, General Smith indicated that some of the auxiliary
                            assumptions included the following: the status of U.S. forces as of the
                            time of the attack would be the same as those actually in being on March
                            1, 1957; a substantial portion of <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>
                            would be in constant alert status; etc. General Smith then indicated
                            that four hypothetical Soviet attacks were planned by the Subcommittee:
                            (a) attack based on Strategic Surprise and aimed only at military
                            targets, (b) an attack based on Strategic Surprise and aimed at
                            composite targets, (c) an attack based on Full Alert and aimed only at
                            military targets, and (d) an attack based on Full Alert and aimed at
                            composite targets.</p>
                        <p>General Smith then called upon Colonel S. D. Kelsey, <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>, a member of the Subcommittee Staff,
                            who presented in detail the highlights of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>’s attack on the continental U.S. He was followed by
                            Captain W. R. Stevens, <gloss target="#t_USN1">USN</gloss>, a member of
                            the Subcommittee Staff, who outlined in some detail the retaliatory
                            attack made on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> by <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>. Colonel Kelsey then gave the results
                            of the country’s damage assessment insofar as the U.S. was concerned. He
                            was followed by Captain Stevens who summarized the results of the damage
                            inflicted on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Dr. L. L. Montague, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, a member of the
                            Subcommittee Staff, presented the effects of Soviet clandestine
                            operations on the continental U.S. [<hi rend="italic">29 words not
                                declassified</hi>]. Dr. Montague was followed by Colonel J.D. Raney,
                                <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>, a member of the Subcommittee
                            Staff, who outlined the military action resulting from three alternative
                            conditions of attack considered by the Subcommittee. Colonel Raney also
                            described the damage done to the U.S. under each of these attacks. In
                            essence, the conclusion was drawn that under any of the attack
                            conditions described by Colonel Raney, the survival of the U.S. would
                            hang in the balance.</p>
                        <p>General Thomas concluded the Staff presentation by noting that any
                            evaluation of net capabilities at a time three years hence was
                            necessarily speculative. As a consequence, the estimates made could be
                            either high or low, but in any event were considered by the Subcommittee
                            to be as realistic as any that could be made at this time. General
                            Thomas noted that the Subcommittee report highlighted a number of
                            deficiencies including: (a) lack of concrete information as to the size
                            of the forces of both the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the
                            U.S. in mid-1960; (b) limitations on the kind and amount of operational
                            data available concerning new weapons; (c) uncertainties as to the
                            extent to which our air defense measures could be degraded by Soviet
                            electronic counter-measures equipment; (d) the paucity of intelligence
                            concerning Soviet guided missiles systems, etc.</p>
                        <p>General Thomas indicated that it was the conclusion of the Subcommittee
                            that in the event of a Soviet attack on the U.S. in 1960, both the U.S.
                            and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would be devastated; that
                            by such an attack the <pb xml:id="pg_675" n="675" facs="0699"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in 1960 could kill from ¼ to ½ of
                            the U.S. population and injure many more in the process; and that
                            military and civilian leadership of the U.S. at the Seat of Government
                            would be virtually wiped out.</p>
                        <p>Upon the completion of the Subcommittee’s presentation, General <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> mentioned that access to the
                            Subcommittee’s report was being strictly limited in accordance with the
                            President’s direction; that only two copies thereof would be made; the
                            President’s copy would be retained in the files of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>, and that a second copy would be
                            designated for the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>’s Disaster
                                File.<note n="3" xml:id="d162fn3">The report is filed in the
                                minutes.</note> He also mentioned that access to the report in any
                            future instance would be decided in each case by the President. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then called for
                            questions.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName> asked that one of
                            the charts utilized by the Staff be re-exhibited, namely the chart
                            dealing with Attack Conditions numbered VI and VIII (Full Alert vs.
                            Strategic Surprise).<note n="4" xml:id="d162fn4">None of the charts is
                                filed in the minutes.</note> Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName> observed that the chart seemed to indicate that
                            the same number of weapons were placed on target and yet there was a
                            large difference in the weight thereof under the respective attack
                            conditions simulated. It was pointed out to Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName> that the 12% increase in the
                            weight of the weapons detonated is attributable to the fact in that, in
                            that particular instance (Full Alert), larger aircraft were mounted
                            where the larger attack occurred, thus enabling the Russians to carry
                            larger weapons.</p>
                        <p>The President referred to that portion of the presentation dealing with
                            Full Alert and queried as to the nature of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>’s calculations relative to our taking the offensive if
                            we were to see tremendous mobilization occurring in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. He wondered if the Russians would
                            dare give the Free World such warning lest it be concerned that we would
                            strike first upon seeing such tremendous mobilization. The President
                            said that while the democracies don’t start wars, the Russians might
                            calculate that they would in such an eventuality.</p>
                        <p>General Thomas commented that it was his own belief that it was not
                            realistic or reasonable to think in terms of starting war under
                            conditions of full alert for the opponent.</p>
                        <p>The President observed that from the presentation it seemed that we
                            suffered more casualties when we were in a state of alert than when we
                            were attacked with no warning. To this General Thomas responded that the
                            distinguishing feature of an attack under conditions of full alert is
                            that each of the adversaries can make a heavier attack under full alert
                            than under conditions of surprise.</p>

                        <p>The President expressed his sincere thanks to the Subcommittee and its
                            Staff for its presentation on the subject.</p>

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> delivered a
                            radio and television address to the American people from the Municipal
                            Auditorium, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, on November 13, at 9:30 p.m. In his
                            speech the President discussed some of the actions in the national
                            security area “to which we must give our most urgent attention.” He
                            specifically mentioned accelerating the dispersal of Strategic Air
                            Command to additional bases, providing facilities for faster response to
                            emergency alarm, development of an active missile defense against
                            missiles, additional funds for research on and testing of missiles,
                            increased pay to military personnel to make military careers more
                            attractive, possible cutbacks in some Federal civilian programs to
                            maintain a balanced budget, and consideration of proposals to strengthen
                            scientific education and basic research.</p>

                            this meeting the Defense Department would make the initial presentation

                            1959. After indicating the order of the speakers, General <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out that at the end of
                            the presentation, there would be ample opportunity for the Council
                            members to express their views on the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1959 military program. General <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> also emphasized that <pb xml:id="pg_678" n="678" facs="0702"/>the President would like to obtain at this meeting the
                            benefit of the corporate judgment of the members of the Council. Such a
                            course would likewise be helpful to the Defense Department in making its
                            final determinations which would be presented at the next Council
                                meeting.<note n="2" xml:id="d164fn2">See <ref target="#d166">Document 166</ref>.</note> He thereupon called on Secretary

                        <p>In his opening remarks Secretary McElroy explained that the figures in
                            the proposed <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959 Budget were based on
                            the 38 billion dollar overall limit. The Budget did not contain a figure
                            for the cost of the implementation of the Cordiner Report. Secretary
                            McElroy added that the military departments would also separately
                            present certain programs which it was their conviction we should
                            implement but which could not be included under the 38 billion dollar
                            ceiling which the Secretary of Defense had instructed the military
                            departments to observe. Thereafter Secretary McElroy called on General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName>.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> explained the
                            background against which the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959
                            Budget had been developed, referring in the course of these general
                            remarks to a chart entitled, “Force Levels for the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959 Budget.”<note n="4" xml:id="d164fn4">None of the charts is filed in the minutes.</note> He added that
                            the substance of his report would be presented by Colonel Nigro, <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>, and Captain J. W. O’Grady, <gloss target="#t_USN1">USN</gloss>. Colonel Nigro discussed the following
                            subjects with the aid of charts: (1) <hi rend="italic">Major Army
                                Forces.</hi> Among other things he pointed out that the 18 Army
                            divisions which had been in existence on June 30, 1957 would be reduced
                            to 14 by June 30, 1959. On the other hand, missile commands would
                            increase from 2 to 4. The overall personnel strength of the Army which
                            amounted to 998,000 on June 30, 1957 would have to be reduced to 850,000
                            by June 30, 1959. (2) <hi rend="italic">MajorNaval Forces.</hi> Colonel
                            Nigro pointed out that the overall personnel strength of the Navy would
                            have to be reduced from the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957
                            figure of 877,000 to 800,000 in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959.
                            (3) Colonel Nigro’s next chart portrayed <hi rend="italic">Major Air
                                Forces.</hi> In his comments Colonel Nigro pointed out that under
                            the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959 Budget planning, <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> wings would be reduced by 7 from the 50
                            of June 30, 1957 to 43 on June 30, 1959. In part this was compensated
                            for by significant increases in missile programs. There would be a very
                            significant reduction in tactical Air Force wings and in the total
                            personnel of the Air Force from 920,000 to about 850,000.</p>
                        <p>This subject was followed by comments on the status of the Air Defense
                            System in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959 and this in turn by a
                            chart indicating the forthcoming <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959
                            deployments of the three military services in the Pacific–Far East area.
                            It was pointed out that under the proposed <pb xml:id="pg_679" n="679" facs="0703"/>budget it would be necessary to withdraw one U.S.
                            division from Korea. This would be offset to some degree at least by an
                            increase of two missile commands. The total reduction in personnel
                            deployed in this area would amount to 51,000 by June 30, 1959. As for
                            the deployment of naval forces there would have to be a reduction in the
                            number of aircraft carriers and a reduction in our submarine
                            capabilities in the Pacific. It was hoped that these reductions might be
                            offset through the maintenance of combat-ready naval forces in the
                            Central and South Pacific. With respect to the Air Force, there would be
                            six wings in the area on June 30, 1959, a marked reduction from the
                            levels of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957. On the other hand, the
                            strength of the Air Force wings would be enhanced by increased nuclear
                            capabilities.</p>
                        <p>Chart 7 indicated the character of the deployment of U.S. military forces
                            in the Europe–Middle East area which it was pointed out was the most
                            critical area. Colonel Nigro and Captain O’Grady pointed out that the
                            Army now had 5 divisions in Western Europe. The proposed <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959 program would require the withdrawal
                            of two battle groups from this force. The result would be an overall
                            decrease in U.S. Army forces in this area by approximately 18,500 men.
                            Navy capabilities would likewise have to be reduced in the area and
                            there would be significant decreases in the Air Force. Some 17 squadrons
                            would have to be pulled out of the area. Inasmuch as these reductions
                            related to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> commitment, the
                            next chart indicated current U.S. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            commitments.</p>
                        <p>The concluding subject and chart consisted of observations on the three
                            most critical problems confronting those who had drawn up the military
                            program for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959. These were the
                            problems of modernization, deployment and firepower. The general
                            conclusion was a clear statement of the decrease in U.S. military
                            capabilities in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959 as compared to
                            these capabilities in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> felt that this was a
                            serious matter which required the most careful study.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of this portion of the presentation, the President said
                            that he had thought it rather curious that while there was a proposed
                            reduction in the total number of Air Force wings, the program
                            nevertheless proposed an increase in the number of tanker aircraft
                            squadrons. Colonel Nigro explained to the President that as B–52’s
                            gradually replaced B–56’s, it was necessary to have additional jet
                            tankers which accounted for the increase in the tanker squadrons.</p>
                        <p>At Secretary McElroy’s suggestion, Assistant Secretary McNeil presented
                            the budget figures for all three of the military services pointing out
                            that they were within the 38 billion dollar ceiling directed by
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>. He likewise
                            pointed out that subsequently the Service Secretaries and the Chiefs of
                            Staff were to be permitted to indicate what each service felt it
                            required above the 38 billion dollar limit.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_680" n="680" facs="0704"/>
                        <p>Secretary McNeil dealt at great length and in detail with three major
                            subjects illustrated by charts. The first of these gave the figures for
                                <hi rend="italic">New Obligation Availability, Direct Obligations,
                                and Expenditures for the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>’s 1957,
                                1958, and 1959</hi>. The second chart broke down these figures in
                            detail in terms of the major military categories of expenditure such as
                            Military Personnel, Operations and Maintenance, Major Procurement, etc.
                            The third chart broke down the second chart into the amounts each
                            service would require for each of the above-mentioned military
                            categories.</p>
                        <p>In concluding his detailed report, Secretary McNeil pointed out that the
                            figures he had presented did not include the cost for implementing the
                            Cordiner recommendations or recommendations for a civilian pay
                            raise.</p>
                        <p>Secretary McElroy next called on Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName>. The latter stated initially that the
                            formulation of the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959 military
                            program had been an austere exercise. Moreover, certain urgently
                            desirable programs had not been included in the 1959 Budget because of
                            the ceiling placed on expenditures and <gloss target="#t_NOA1">NOA</gloss>. Some of these urgent additional programs had
                            Department-wide bearing and implications. It was with these that
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> said he would
                            deal, leaving to the Service Secretaries and other add-on programs which
                            each service felt to be necessary.</p>
                        <p>Thereafter, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> in
                            line with these comments dealt first with the feeling in the Defense
                            Department that the Cordiner recommendations should implemented. If this
                            was ultimately agreed, the implementation of the Cordiner plan and
                            related matters would involve an addition of some 700 million dollars
                            annually in the Defense Department Budget.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> dealt
                            with the impact of the report of the Security Resources Panel (the
                            so-called Gaither Report)<note n="5" xml:id="d164fn5">The Gaither Report
                                was circulated as <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5724, <ref target="#d158">Document 158</ref>.</note> which had been
                            presented to the National Security Council on November 7 of this
                                year.<note n="6" xml:id="d164fn6">See <ref target="#d156">Document
                                    156</ref>.</note> Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> pointed out that if we implemented the list of
                            programs to which the Gaither Panel had assigned an A priority, it would
                            cost an additional 2.8 billion dollars in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959. If we went further and implemented the
                            recommendations to which the Gaither Panel had given a B priority, there
                            would be an additional cost of 1.86 billion dollars. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> pointed out that these were
                            definitely additive programs and had not been included in the estimates
                            thus far given in this presentation. There would be further allusions to
                            these recommendations in the subsequent reports by the Service
                            Secretaries and the Chiefs of Staff of the Services.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_681" n="681" facs="0705"/>
                        <p>Thirdly, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName>
                            discussed the impact of the reductions which would have to be made in
                            the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959 programs on our forces
                            deployed overseas. The most serious effect would be felt in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The proposed 1959 Budget would call
                            for the withdrawal of 2/5 of one of our five divisions deployed in
                            Western Europe. General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>
                            felt that such a reduction would have a most unfortunate effect as
                            regards the current climate in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. It
                            was not clear what could be done to meet General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>’s objections and anxiety but
                            the Defense Department was trying to work out some plan which would not
                            necessitate our going to the Paris <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            meeting next month with proposals for reducing the personnel of U.S.
                            forces in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> area.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> indicated that
                            air force reductions in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> area
                            were likewise a matter of great concern to General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> thought it was possible that
                            some of the aircraft and personnel which we had thought it necessary to
                            take out of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> area could be left
                            there as the result of a new plan they were working out with General
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> but if this was
                            successful it would add another 39 million dollars to the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959 budget.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Korea, the proposed withdrawal of one of the two U.S. Army
                            divisions was completely unacceptable from the point of view of our
                            political relations with the Republic of Korea and affected our hope of
                            inducing the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> to make a substantial
                            reduction of its own force levels. Accordingly, we were also trying to
                            work out a plan which would avoid a decrease in U.S. Army personnel in
                            Korea.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> next turned to
                            the problem of defense against Soviet Intercontinental Ballistic
                            Missiles. The sum of approximately 200 million dollars had been budgeted
                            for this purpose by the Services for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1959. On the other hand, the Gaither Committee recommended strongly an
                            acceleration of the programs for our defense against <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>’s. Accordingly, the Defense
                            Department believed that it was an urgent necessity that we add some 100
                            million dollars more to this program for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959 although this amount would still fall short of
                            meeting the acceleration recommended by the Gaither Panel.</p>
                        <p>As for our satellite programs, the reconnaissance satellite and space
                            research and development, approximately 100 million dollars would be
                            required although here again this sum would not meet the expectations
                            and demands of enthusiastic protagonists of space research.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName>
                            pointed out that the three services in presenting their individual
                            add-on programs would do so as a result of individual appraisal of the
                            needs of each of the services by that service. The total of the
                            resulting sums would, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> thought, doubtless be well in excess of what we
                            judge to be feasible in the light of our overall fiscal situation.
                            Accordingly, at the next Council meeting on this subject, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> indicated that the
                            Department <pb xml:id="pg_682" n="682" facs="0706"/>of Defense would be
                            in a position to present a Defense Department package containing the
                            approved add-on programs as opposed to the individual service estimates
                            of what was required by way of add-on programs.</p>
                        <p>When Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> had
                            concluded his portion of the presentation, the President pointed out
                            that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> had made
                            mention that the Department of Defense as such was taking over direction
                            of all the satellite programs. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> had then proceeded to mention the program for
                            achieving an Air Force reconnaissance satellite. Did this mean that the
                            Defense Department was not taking over direction of all satellite
                            programs?</p>
                        <p>Secretary McElroy assured the President that all such programs would be
                            taken over from the individual services by the Department of Defense. He
                            then called upon Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BWM1">Brucker</persName> to discuss the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1959 Army program. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BWM1">Brucker</persName> indicated that both he and General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> would deal with this subject.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> first exhibited a
                            chart entitled, “Application of Resources within Expenditure Ceiling of
                            8.6 Billion for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959”. After
                            explaining the application of resources, General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> stated his strong agreement
                            with the comments of earlier speakers as to the seriousness of reducing
                            Army deployments and capabilities in Western Europe and in Korea.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> felt that there
                            were three serious problems. The first was the reduction of Army
                            overseas deployment, the second was the reduction of mobile strategic
                            divisions at home in the U.S. and the third was the slow progress in the
                            development of continental defense. If these problems could not be
                            satisfactorily solved, the U.S. Army and our Allies would find
                            themselves at a serious disadvantage vis-à-vis the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as the military capabilities of the
                            latter continued to increase.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BWM1">Brucker</persName> first spoke of
                            the decline in the Army’s operational capabilities which would result
                            from significant reductions in money available to the Army. He
                            illustrated his point with charts entitled “The Decline of Available
                            Money <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958–<gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959” and a second chart indicating how under the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959 Budget the Army’s rate of
                            modernization would decline.</p>
                        <p>In his summary Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BWM1">Brucker</persName>
                            strongly recommended a reversal of the trends portrayed by the
                            above-mentioned charts and asked for supplementary resources for the
                            Army in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 and additional
                            appropriations in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959. He indicated a
                            strong conviction that we should retain our present <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and Korean deployments. The Army also
                            recommended acceleration of the rate of modernization. If these Army
                            recommendations were accepted, the result would be an increase of 53,000
                            men in the ranks of active Army personnel and in an increase of 738
                            million dollars for the Army <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959
                            Budget.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_683" n="683" facs="0707"/>
                        <p>At Secretary McElroy’s suggestion Secretary Gates covered the
                            presentation of the Navy Department Budget for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959. He noted that if the recommendations of the Navy
                            for programs which ought to be added to those now proposed under the 38
                            billion dollar ceiling were accepted, the result would be to raise the
                            Navy Budget for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959 by a figure of 1
                            billion 370 thousand dollars.</p>
                        <p>Similarly, Secretary Douglas explained the Air Force program for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959 under the guidelines which
                            established a ceiling of 18.1 billion dollars for the Air Force program
                            in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959. Thereupon Secretary Douglas
                            suggested various add-on programs which the Air Force deemed it
                            essential to include in the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959
                            Budget. The total add-on programs suggested by Secretary Douglas
                            involved supplemental appropriations for the Air Force for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 of 349.4 million as well as an
                            additional appropriation for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959 of
                            1.97 billion dollars.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Douglas was followed by General White who emphasized the
                            highlights of the Air Force <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959
                            Budget which in summary he said would cut out all the fat and quite a
                            bit of muscle as well.</p>
                        <p>(At this point Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            joined the meeting. 11:05 am)</p>
                        <p>When General White had concluded his remarks, the President inquired
                            about the current status of the procurement of B–58 jet bombers and why
                            we were continuing to procure B–52’s while also procuring the improved
                            B–58’s. General White replied to the President by stating that we were
                            giving these new bombers full and complete tests but that no B–58’s had
                            yet been put into operational units and would not be until we knew more
                            about them.</p>
                        <p>In his concluding remarks on the Defense Department presentation
                            Secretary McElroy noted the intention of the Department of Defense to
                            review all the several priority add-on programs suggested during the
                            presentation. A final Budget for the Department of Defense would be
                            presented at the next Council meeting on the 21st or the 25th of the
                                month.<note n="7" xml:id="d164fn7">The budget for the Department of
                                Defense was presented at the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>

                        </p>
                        <p>The President then stated that he rather doubted the worth of the
                            Council’s digging into all these matters before the next meeting on the
                            subject but he did have one or two points to make. He was troubled that
                            none of the statements made in the course of the presentation indicated
                            that the implementation of the Cordiner Report would result in a
                            reduction in the total level of military personnel. The President also
                            inquired as to what changes were being made in the atomic submarine Sea
                            Wolf which the President understood was a first class vessel. Secretary
                            Gates indicated that the power plant of the Sea Wolf was considered to
                            be dangerous and that it was proposed to change the type of atomic power
                            plant in that submarine.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_684" n="684" facs="0708"/>
                        <p>The President said that he kept hearing in the course of the presentation
                            that the Defense Department was going to continue with both the Titan
                            and the Atlas <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> programs and also
                            continue both the Thor and the Jupiter <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> programs. The President said that it was his
                            understanding that these <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> programs were only to be
                            developed to a point which would enable us to choose the most effective
                            of the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> missiles. Secretary McElroy replied
                            that we would indeed choose one or another of these missile programs or
                            possibly both if both proved successful. The President warned that he
                            did not wish large numbers of these missiles to be procured until they
                            had been proved out in tests.</p>
                        <p>The President likewise stressed his conviction of the need for greater
                            centralization of research and development in the Defense Department.
                            This, he believed, would effect great savings of money and of the time
                            and energy of our scientists. Secretary McElroy indicated that the
                            Defense Department would soon be gaining valuable experience as to the
                            desirability of the President’s view as a result of the Department’s
                            experience with its centralized outer space research programs.</p>
                        <p>The President then observed philosophically that the presentation
                            indicated that we were facing a very tough situation. The problem
                            sometimes seemed to be almost insoluble. The Council would remember that
                            only 2 ½ years ago the Joint Chiefs of Staff had gone off to Puerto Rico
                            and had come up with the statement that 38 billion dollars a year would
                            do what was necessary, at least as a minimum. Now, here we are only 2 ½
                            years later with a minimum well beyond the 38 billion dollar figure and
                            beyond the additional resources which we could anticipate from the
                            annual increment of our Gross National Product. Accordingly, the
                            President expressed his satisfaction that the Department of Defense
                            would now go over carefully the service estimates of additional funds
                            which they felt were required.</p>
                        <p>At General <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>’s suggestion,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> expressed the
                            keen interest of the Department of State in the problems of maintaining
                            our overseas deployments and the high level of equipment and the high
                            quality of equipment of these forces. He believed that if we could
                            maintain our existing deployment for approximately an additional 200
                            million dollars, this was a highly desirable course of action. Cutting
                            our overseas deployment would have a great impact on our Allies and on
                            our foreign policy. The President expressed the opinion that the
                            interest of the Department of State was generally limited to assurance
                            that mobile U.S. forces could be sent overseas promptly to meet critical
                            situations. The President then asked Mr. Harold Vance, who was sitting
                            for Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Strauss</persName>, if he had
                            any comments on what he had listened to this morning. Mr. Vance
                            expressed the opinion that the <pb xml:id="pg_685" n="685" facs="0709"/>President was quite right in his belief that we could save
                            considerable amount of money if there were greater centralization of
                            research in the Department of Defense.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> said that he and
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> had been
                            totaling up informally the total cost of the add-on programs which had
                            been mentioned in the course of the presentation. Their total amounted
                            to approximately 4 billion 800 million in new obligational authority.
                            The President commented wryly that the trouble with new obligational
                            authority levels was that these levels soon became formed into
                            expenditure levels.</p>
                        <p>In response to a suggestion from General <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> made a brief comment on the implications of all
                            these figures for the financial and economic well-being of the country.
                            Up to recently we had been saying that if all our plans work out we
                            would end up the fiscal year with a surplus of approximately 1.8
                            billion. At the present moment, however, the economy of the U.S. was
                            certainly not in the course of an upward movement. Indeed if the economy
                            stays at present levels or drops, we might for the first time in the
                            present Administration be contemplating an unbalanced budget. While
                            nobody could really foretell the size of the Treasury’s income, it may
                            now be nearer 72 billion than the 76 billion we had previously
                            estimated. It is of extreme importance to realize the possibility of an
                            unbalanced budget.</p>
                        <p>Again at the suggestion of General <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>, Mr. Saulnier said that he merely wanted to make
                            it clear to all concerned that any hopes for Treasury receipts in the
                            range of 76 billion dollars were quite unrealistic at the present time.
                            He said he believed that at the rate the economy was moving the Treasury
                            receipts for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 would be around 72.8
                            billion. If this indeed proved to be the case there would be no
                            significant surplus at the end of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958
                            and possibly even a small deficit. This change in the budgetary outlook
                            was due in general to a falling off of economic activity. This falling
                            off was related to the fact of less expenditure. While Dr. Saulnier
                            described himself as no deficit-expenditure theorist, we should bear in
                            mind that our troubles do come in part from reduction in levels of
                            expenditures, both government and private. This trend could be reversed
                            either by balancing the budget and providing a tax cut which would
                            stimulate the economy or it might be met by increased government
                            expenditure which would stimulate economic activity.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> said that he had
                            been much impressed with statements as to the date when our missiles
                            were going to begin to come in which he understood was 1960. With a
                            stepped-up effort Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> understood that this
                            goal could be achieved in 1959. [<hi rend="italic">1 sentence (16 words)

                        <pb xml:id="pg_686" n="686" facs="0710"/>
                        <p>Asked to comment by General <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>,
                            Director <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> pointed out
                            that he and his associates had been working very hard on the civilian
                            side of the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959 Budget. However, acts
                            of Congress made it practically impossible to reduce civilian
                            expenditures without new legislation. This meant serious political
                            problems were going to face us in the future.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he wanted to repeat what he had said many times
                            before. He was not so concerned about achieving a balanced budget in any
                            one year but he did believe that you could not have a repeated
                            unbalanced budget year after year and at the same time maintain the
                            nation’s security.</p>
                        <p>We must keep a very close watch on the relationship between expenditures
                            and our Gross National Product. We must somehow try to achieve the right
                            balance between a desirable defense program and our available resources.
                            We could not take any risks to our national security but we would
                            certainly have to make some very hard decisions.</p>

                            President met with the group to consider a few points on the military
                            budget. He said that he wanted to approach these proposals not on the
                            basis of “can we do it in response to public outcry,” but “should we do
                            it.” The matter is not one of justification, but rather of need. He
                            mentioned that the psychology of the business community will be of the
                            utmost importance in our financial affairs next year, and alluded to a
                                letter<note n="3" xml:id="d165fn3">Not found in the Eisenhower
                                Library or Department of State files.</note> which indicated that
                            confidence would be impaired, businessmen would be cautious, and a drop
                            off in the economy would occur, if we went in for a high budget this
                            year.</p>
                        <p>He said he was not trying to set himself up as knowing the exact amounts
                            that should be scheduled, and under what arrangements with regard to the
                            proposed additional $573 million for guided missiles. He said he did
                            want to have things that are well proven before we commit ourselves to
                            procurement. If we are not reasonably sure, we could put them into our
                            request if we desire, but must bring out that we might place contracts
                            of only $200 million, but might go to the full $573 million if
                            technology justifies it. He said that the same end could probably be
                            accomplished by coming back to Congress for a supplemental after January
                            1, 1959.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> reviewed the schedule
                            on which these funds were based. Initially we had planned to put an
                            emergency force in the UK in mid-1958, with one squadron established in
                            1959. Later we thought we would omit the emergency force and work for
                            one squadron in 1959, rising to four squadrons in 1960. Within the last
                            few weeks we have studied programs going beyond the four-squadron plan,
                            and now propose to move toward sixteen squadrons in 1963. If we are
                            willing to take some chances, with considerable confidence, but not <pb xml:id="pg_688" n="688" facs="0712"/>with certainty, we could go to
                            a program of one squadron in the United Kingdom by the end of calendar
                            year 1958, and another squadron—this one capable of “quick reaction
                            time”—by July 1959.</p>
                        <p>The President asked why we had changed from the idea that we would select
                            as between Thor and Jupiter at an early date. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> said there was not enough
                            evidence that either would become a satisfactorily proven weapon. He
                            thought Mr. Holaday was about to recommend proceeding with the United
                            Kingdom commitments on the basis of Thor. If we wished to have
                            continental deployments before the end of 1959, we should also use
                            Jupiter for that purpose. By accelerations we could get the first
                            squadron by the first quarter of 1959. The President acknowledged that
                            the production of both would probably be faster than the production of
                            one, since the technicians are in being and functioning now.</p>
                        <p>He then reverted to his view that we should not spend money simply
                            because of public pressure, but should do what is based on real need. He
                            stressed that the whole arms question is relative and that Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s will not overmatch our bomber power
                            in the next few years. He thought we should go forward simply as fast as
                            our good sense and the probabilities of the situation seem to
                            warrant.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McElroy said it would cost money at an earlier date to move toward
                            the accelerated deployments. He stressed, however, the psychological
                            impact of the first units for initial deployments. He thought we need
                            not race to conclude further agreements and said we would work with the
                            State Department not to press us too hard. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> added that missile deployments
                            are really the crux of the forthcoming <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting.<note n="4" xml:id="d165fn4">For documentation
                                on the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> heads of government
                                meeting in Paris, December 16–19, see vol. IV, pp. 1 ff.</note> The
                            ability to carry these out is most important.</p>
                        <p>The President recalled that we thought we had a pretty fine budget at $38
                            billion. He was agreeable to adding $700 million for improved pay, and
                            would agree to the $573 million additional for acceleration of missiles,
                            when the funds are in fact required. He then discussed briefly the
                            question as to where the $140 million for additional research is to
                            go.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McElroy concluded by saying that we will be up approximately $700
                            million in expenditures above <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>–58, and
                            this is just the amount of the pay increase proposed. He thought we
                            should be somewhere between $39 billion and $40 billion in <gloss target="#t_NOA1">NOA</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> introduced the
                            subject and called upon Secretary McElroy. Secretary McElroy informed
                            the Council of what had transpired since the last <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting when the Defense Department had
                            indicated to the National Security Council how it was tentatively
                            proposing to allocate funds to the several military programs in
                            accordance with the 38 billion dollar limit on New Obligational
                            Authority and on Expenditures.<note n="3" xml:id="d166fn3">See <ref target="#d164">Document 164</ref>.</note> He reminded the
                            Council that at last week’s meeting the heads of the Military
                            Departments and the Chiefs of Staff of the Services had gone on to
                            indicate what each of the Military Departments believed to be required
                            by way of additional programs (add-ons) over and above the 38 billion
                            dollar limit. In the days following last week’s meeting, Secretary
                            McElroy indicated that after consultation with the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff, the Service Secretaries and other officials of the Defense
                            Department, a selection had been made among the add-on programs of those
                            which represented the highest urgency and need. Subsequent to this
                            selection, these high priority add-on programs had been discussed with
                            the President himself.<note n="4" xml:id="d166fn4">See the memorandum of
                                conference, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note> Thereafter, these
                            agreed add-on programs had been incorporated in the recommendations
                            which would be presented today by Assistant Secretary of Defense McNeil.
                            Secretary McElroy also pointed out that, as the President and the
                            Council would have expected, the Department of Defense had tried to fund
                            as many of these add-on programs as possible within the 38 billion
                            dollar limit of the Defense Department Budget. This had not proved
                            entirely possible and the Budget which would be presented today for
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959 would be higher than the
                            Defense Department Budget for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958. He
                            then called on Secretary McNeil. (A copy of Secretary McNeil’s

                        <p>These strengths will permit the retention of 2 Divisions in Korea and 5
                            Divisions in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and the minimum Air
                            Force requirements of <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>
                            through CY 1959. Note that there will be reduction in the National Guard

                        <p>The present agreed expenditure allocation for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 is $38.670 billion. To carry out several
                            augmentation programs now scheduled, it will be necessary to make
                            approximately $411 million more <gloss target="#t_NOA1">NOA</gloss>
                            available during <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958. Possibly
                            one-half of this amount could be met by transfers of existing funds. The
                            other half will have to be met either by a supplemental appropriation
                            request or deferring certain <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958
                            programs so as to utilize the funds thus made available. The total
                                <gloss target="#t_NOA1">NOA</gloss> of $411 million would increase
                            the present <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 expenditure
                            allocation of $38.670 billion by $91 million.</p>
                        <p>Secretary McElroy pointed out at the conclusion of Secretary McNeil’s
                            presentation that it was going to be very difficult to come to a
                            definite decision with respect to acceleration of the Intermediate Range
                            Ballistic Missile Program. The 570 million dollars for <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> acceleration would permit 16
                            squadrons of Jupiter or Thor by 1963. Before deciding on further
                            acceleration, Secretary McElroy thought he needed more discussion with
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>. He suggested
                            that if a decision to accelerate were made immediately, one squadron of
                                <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>’s could be made operational by
                            the end of 1958. While this would involve additional funds, such a
                            course of action would help the morale of our Allies and assist the
                            United States in the forthcoming <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            meeting. Secretary McElroy said he could not be more definite at the
                            moment on this subject.</p>
                        <p>When Secretary McElroy had finished his comments, the President asked
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> if he had any
                            questions. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said
                            that he had had a talk just prior to this Council meeting with Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName>. He had informed them of his
                            belief that it would be important to say at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting that we were capable of making available to
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> (in addition to our commitment
                            to the United Kingdom) one squadron of <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>’s by the end of Calendar 1959. This date was probably
                            the earliest when <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would be in a
                            position of readiness, with respect to bases, training, etc., to receive
                            such squadrons. But if we could make such a statement as this, the
                            effect would be very reassuring.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired whether the countries receiving <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> squadrons would undertake to build
                            the necessary ground installations. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that this question had not
                            been settled. The President said he supposed that ground installations
                            for <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> squadrons would be very
                            expensive. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName>
                            confirmed the President’s supposition by stating that the ground
                            installation would prove almost as expensive as the <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> itself. The cost might amount to <pb xml:id="pg_692" n="692" facs="0716"/>somewhere in the neighborhood
                            of 50 million dollars if all the equipment, etc. were included. The
                            President commented that the elaborate character of such a ground
                            installation suggested to him that such installations would be prime
                            targets for an enemy attack.</p>
                        <p>In order to avoid requesting New Obligational Authority without precise
                            foreknowledge of the need for appropriated funds for missile production
                            (when operational capability is ascertained), Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> asked whether we should seek
                            authority for the Secretary of Defense, with the approval of the
                            President, to make transfers among appropriated funds or alternatively
                            should authority be sought for the Secretary of Defense, likewise with
                            Presidential approval, to contract for the purchase of missiles in
                            addition to appropriated funds, at a time when Congress was not in
                            session.</p>
                        <p>Secretary McNeil thought that such a part-appropriation and part-contract
                            authority would lead to difficulties except on a one-time basis. The
                            President, however, seemed to prefer Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>’s idea for seeking contract
                            authority over and above appropriations—for use when Congress was not in
                            session—on a missile break-through.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the Outer Space Program, the President expressed
                            satisfaction that the Department of Defense was to have 100 million
                            dollars for this program. On the other hand, the President said he did
                            not believe the Air Force as such should have one cent for this program.
                            Secretary McElroy explained that the Air Force was not going to proceed
                            with its own Outer Space Program (apart from the Department of Defense
                            Program) but at the appropriate time would transfer Air Force funds into
                            the Department of Defense Budget for the Outer Space Program. The
                            President stated with great firmness that he thought this was Secretary
                            McElroy’s business and not the business of the Air Force. Secretary
                            McElroy again explained that the appearance of a figure in the Air Force
                            Budget for an Outer Space Program simply indicated that he, Secretary
                            McElroy, did not wish to interrupt progress on the Air Force Outer Space
                            Program until such time as the Department of Defense was ready to take
                            over the Outer Space Program.</p>
                        <p>The President said that there was another part of his question with
                            respect to the Outer Space Program. Did Secretary McElroy and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> believe that as much
                            as 200 million dollars would be necessary for the Outer Space Program in
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> said that he was not in a
                            position to give a firm answer to the President’s question as yet but he
                            thought that the 200 million dollars was necessary.</p>
                        <p>The President indicated that he was not so sure and he pointed out that
                            he had that morning received a very gloomy letter from one of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>’s “old associates” complaining about
                            the growing lack of confidence by U.S. business in the Administration
                            and warning that <pb xml:id="pg_693" n="693" facs="0717"/>we were going
                            to go to Hell as a result of our large Government expenditures.<note n="7" xml:id="d166fn7">Reference is presumably to the letter the
                                President mentioned in his meeting earlier in the day; see <ref target="#d162fn3">footnote 3</ref>, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> then raised the
                            question of the use of certain stockpile materials for military
                            production. This suggestion seemed to have merit in the eyes of
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> but it was
                            pointed out by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gordon Gray</persName> and
                            others that such use of stockpile materials would not prevent the
                            suppliers from continuing to put into the Government stockpile materials
                            under their contracts. The only advantage to be gained by using
                            stockpile materials for military purposes would be to avoid continuing
                            to carry a surplus of materials in the stockpile.</p>
                        <p>The President asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>
                            whether it was not a fact that the contracts for stockpile materials
                            were originally entered into so that the Government could supply
                            materials like aluminum to the aircraft companies under certain
                            circumstances. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> replied
                            that the primary motive was to achieve expansion of productive
                            capacity.</p>
                        <p>Referring to forthcoming Congressional hearings, the Vice President
                            predicted that strenuous efforts would be made by members of Congress to
                            find areas where certain defense programs could move faster even on a
                            crash basis. Congressmen might argue for more rapid production of
                            operational missiles even if they were not as good quality as we could
                            wish. The Vice President believed that if these hearings brought out the
                            point that we had the capability to put a squadron of <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>’s in Europe by the end of Calendar
                            1958, even if these missiles were not fully proved out, there would be
                            strong Congressional pressure to take the risk and place the squadron in
                            Europe for psychological reasons.</p>
                        <p>Secretary McElroy expressed his general agreement with the Vice
                            President’s comment but pointed out that there was a difference between
                            putting squadrons in the United Kingdom and in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>’s would be in
                            the United Kingdom late in Calendar Year 1958.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> expressed doubt
                            whether the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nations in Western
                            Europe would actually be ready to receive <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>’s prior to Mid-1959. Accordingly, he would counsel
                            against accelerating this program in order to be able to send an
                            imperfect <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> before our European Allies were ready
                            to use it. Secretary Douglas of the Air Force indicated that our <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> program vis-è-vis the United Kingdom
                            contemplated that the first <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>
                            squadron in the United Kingdom would be U.S.-manned.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President repeated that from information and rumor available to
                            him, he judged that there would be heavy Congressional pressure to go
                            ahead on a crash program to achieve operational <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>’s by the end of the Calendar Year 1958. With a smile
                            the President <pb xml:id="pg_694" n="694" facs="0718"/>asked the Vice
                            President which of the two parties was likely to propose a big tax
                            increase in order to mount a crash program. The President indicated,
                            however, that he had no objection to going forward with this program for
                            the United Kingdom. Secretary McElroy added a warning that there would
                            be need for additional money if this acceleration of the <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> program was decided on.</p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> asked several
                            questions, notably about the possibility that Congress might decide to
                            cut out Defense Department carry-over funds, about another attack
                            carrier, and about the possibility of saving money by slowing up the
                            process of promotion in the armed forces. This last suggestion produced
                            a brief discussion of the recommendations of the Cordiner Report.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> and Secretary
                            Douglas expressed the opinion that implementation of the Cordiner Report
                            would ultimately result in a savings but not in the first year.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> then inquired whether
                            the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959 Defense Department program
                            contemplated restricting construction to the high priority needs of the
                            Department of Defense and further whether it was possible to close down
                            some military installations.</p>
                        <p>Secretary McElroy replied that the Defense Department did indeed hope to
                            find some military facilities which could be closed down.</p>
                        <p>By way of suggesting a consensus, General <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> asked whether the Council action on this agenda
                            item should state that the National Security Council found that the
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959 Defense Department Budget and
                            programs were consistent with the requirements of our national security
                            policies. The President seemed to find General <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>’s suggestion desirable but added
                            that he wished Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> and
                            Secretary McElroy to go over the figures which had been presented to the
                            Council at this meeting with a view to seeing just how much of this
                            money must be placed in the New Obligational Authority column for the
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959. Should the total figure be
                            presented for <gloss target="#t_NOA1">NOA</gloss> or should it be partly
                            presented for <gloss target="#t_NOA1">NOA</gloss> and partly for
                            Contingent Contract Authority in addition to <gloss target="#t_NOA1">NOA</gloss>? The President went on to remind the members of the
                            Council that when the Council had first become involved directly in the
                            ballistic missiles programs he had expressed the opinion that the effect
                            of ballistic missiles would be more important in the psychological area
                            than in the area of military weapons. He still felt that as a weapon the
                            manned bomber was superior to the missile. We were now, however, in a
                            transitional period but it was still a question how much money we are
                            justified in asking for on behalf of these missiles programs. In
                            conclusion the President again directed Secretary McElroy to provide Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> with the
                            crystallized views of the Department of Defense after which he wished
                            these views to be considered at a restricted meeting.</p>

                        <p>I know you are concerned, as I am, that the very considerable public and
                            congressional interest in missiles may lead to congressional emphasis on
                            programs of this nature at the expense of other essential but less
                            dramatic and less popular programs such as mutual security and our
                            information program. However, if this aroused public and congressional
                            opinion can be properly channeled, it will help obtain favorable action
                            on these more difficult programs.</p>
                        <p>In order to accomplish this I would like to suggest that for your meeting
                            with the leadership on December 3 and in your State of the Union
                                Message,<note n="2" xml:id="d167fn2">The President’s State of the

                            together the major pieces of legislation closely related to national
                            security and present them as a single balanced “Program for National
                            Security.” I have in mind that this program would include not only such
                            items as (i) strengthening our own nuclear capabilities through missile
                            development, and (ii) maintaining strong ground, naval and tactical air
                            forces, but also (iii) amendments of the atomic energy act to strengthen
                            our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> position, (iv) the Mutual
                            Security Program, (v) trade agreements, and (vi) the U.S. Information
                            Program. Any other items as closely related to national security might
                            properly be included.</p>
                        <p>Combining these items into a single program of six (or seven) specific
                            points would help to focus public and congressional attention on each
                            item as important to the entire effort and would perhaps gain increased
                            support for items which are currently less attractive to the public but
                            are equally important to our national security.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>There was a long discussion about accelerating the intermediate missiles
                            program. I said that from a foreign policy standpoint I thought that the
                            need could be met if, in addition to meeting our UK commitment, we were
                            in a position to deliver one or two squadrons of missiles to the
                            continent by the end of 1959. I said that getting ready to receive these
                            would involve a series of measures, strategic, political, fiscal, and so
                            forth, quite apart from the actual construction work which I understood
                            would take about a year. Also there would be training required, etc. I
                            felt therefore that a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> program
                            looking toward reception would probably take about two years from the
                            present date. However it seemed to be the consensus that the program
                            should be somewhat accelerated beyond that, largely for psychological
                            reasons, and it was tentatively agreed to try to have the British
                            missiles ready by the end of 1958 and the others for the continent by
                            the middle of 1959. Mr. McElroy said that they would probably go into
                            production with both Jupiter and Thor if they had to go now. I inclined
                            toward a more conservative program, delaying the production until a
                            choice could be made. However, it seemed to be felt that other factors
                            were controlling and there was an irresistible pressure to accelerate
                            the program and demonstrate our capacity as rapidly as possible.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_698" n="698" facs="0722"/>
                        <p>I emphasized that an accelerated program would on net balance be very
                            serious if the cost of acceleration were, directly or indirectly, taken
                            out of the Mutual Security Program. I said this program represented the
                            struggle we were actually fighting on a daily basis and that our
                            resources were stretched very thin. I referred to the fact that I
                            understood the Bureau of the Budget was proposing to cut our figure by
                            about $1 billion and that I said would be disastrous. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> said the figure of $1 billion
                            was an exaggeration. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName>
                            said that it was at least $700 million.</p>

                        <p>The President opened the meeting by commenting that while he apparently
                            had no physical defects as the result of his most recent illness,<note n="2" xml:id="d169fn2">The President suffered a slight occlusion of
                                the cerebral artery on November 25 and was indisposed for a few
                                days.</note> he still had a little difficulty articulating; hence he
                            would leave the discussion mostly to others.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows discussion on unrelated subjects.]</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Defense Program</hi>—(The President rejoined the
                            meeting for this item.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. McElroy introduced his presentation with a personal statement of his
                            own desire to Cooperate closely with the Congress, especially as he
                            looked upon investigating committees as being desirable and essential to
                            an informed public opinion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McElroy recounted how the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ’59
                            program was reassessed late in the year in the light of Sputnik, and how
                            a number of high priority projects were added to the program previously
                            developed. Coordinately, the program was reviewed for marginal items
                            that could be dropped, but its total cost for the future is somewhat
                            higher than this year’s program. He noted that the reductions made would
                            inevitably result in complaints from those affected, but Defense would
                            endeavor to handle them in such a way as to minimize the impact. He
                            noted especially that the new, more powerful, complex weapons were very
                            expensive but would lead to a declining force level though improvement
                            in quality.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McElroy said he was not asking the Leadership to concur in all of
                            these, but rather to think about the problem along the lines that
                            Defense had to consider and to remember that our defense posture is not
                            based on force levels alone.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName>, with the aid of
                                charts,<note n="3" xml:id="d169fn3">Not found in the Eisenhower
                                Library or Department of State files.</note> went over the proposed
                            arrangements for the various forces noting such things as the reduction
                            of one division in the Army, the increase of missile battalions, the
                            reduction of four tactical combat wings from the Air Force, etc. He
                            pointed out the projected strength of the various services for the end
                            of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ’59, showing particularly a 30,000
                            reduction for the Army. He then went over the proposed geographical
                            location of forces, noting particularly <pb xml:id="pg_700" n="700" facs="0724"/>that the number of Air Force squadrons earmarked for
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would be maintained at 75 but
                            more would be held in place in the United States than was originally
                            programmed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> recounted the
                            procedures followed in developing this budget. Starting with a $38
                            billion “guidelines” target, an exercise was conducted to see what could
                            best be done at that level. The programs set forth by the Services were
                            then reviewed both by <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, with a resultant feeling that the
                            “guidelines” budget was a close approximation to the best possible at
                            that level. Then the departments were asked to submit lists of
                            augmentations they would welcome, and these became—naturally—very long
                            and expensive. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> unanimously
                            recommended that Defense emphasize eight of them: <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> alert and dispersal, ballistic missile
                            detection, ballistic missile acceleration, satellite and outer space
                            programs, anti-submarine warfare, research and development, Pentomic
                            division modernization, and implementation of the Cordiner Report in
                            part.</p>
                        <p>Speaker Rayburn was interested in progress made in ballistic missile
                            detection. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> said that
                            the principles have been established and that we have an experimental
                            unit already developed substantially like what would be achieved by the
                            budget item for three of the new type installations.</p>
                        <p>Re ballistic missiles, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName>
                            said that five long range ones were under development—2 intermediate, 2
                            intercontinental, and 1 shipbased (Polaris). Sen.
                                <persName>Anderson</persName> asked about the Snark and was informed
                            that it was not a ballistic-type; it would be discussed later. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> said that Titan was
                            not being accelerated at present because its development was more
                            remote, but Polaris would be accelerated and the submarines were
                            expected to be operational at the end of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ’61, two years earlier than heretofore expected.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> pointed out that the
                            Secretary of Defense intends to set up a development agency within
                                <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss> for satellite and outer space
                            programs.</p>
                        <p>Sen. <persName>Anderson</persName> inquired about a report, perhaps
                            unfounded, that the new submarine would have less speed than the
                            Nautilus. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> promised to
                            check that out.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> commented briefly on
                            the increased funds for research and development, particularly for
                            fundamental research activities. On the Cordiner Report, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> emphasized the importance of
                            improving the technical ability of personnel, hence legislation would be
                            proposed for some if not all of the most important specific
                            recommendations. Sen. Russell<note n="4" xml:id="d169fn4">Senator
                                Richard B. Russell (D–Ga.).</note> commented at length on the need
                            for going very carefully over any pay bill and recognizing the new
                            character <pb xml:id="pg_701" n="701" facs="0725"/>of the Armed
                            Services. He thought it desirable to develop new ranks bearing new
                            names, and to oppose any across-the-board increase.</p>
                        <p>In response to a query, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> pointed out that the eight augmentation items
                            would require an additional $2 billion or more in authorizations for
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ’59 and ’60.</p>
                        <p>Rep. Cannon<note n="5" xml:id="d169fn5">Representative Clarence Cannon
                                (D–Mo.).</note> asked about activities dropped out. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> pointed to the reduction of the
                            force level from 2.8 million to 2.5, also to the cutback in logistical
                            support (bases, camps, posts, warehouses, etc.) made possible as the
                            number of divisions and wings goes down.</p>
                        <p>Sen. <persName>Anderson</persName> thought it would be very difficult to
                            drop posts and bases. He then returned to the subject of missiles and
                            expressed a strong view that there were too many different kinds,
                            involving much duplication, as witness the failure to make use in a new
                            missile, like Polaris, of what had been done in connection with Thor and
                            Jupiter. Mr. McElroy believed it not possible to use the same propellant
                            in a submarine missile. He saw a possibility that Polaris might lead to
                            having a successor type to the Thor and Jupiter. Sen.
                                <persName>Anderson</persName> referred to what Sen. Byrd<note n="6" xml:id="d169fn6">Senator Harry Flood Byrd (D–Va.).</note> might be
                            expected to say about this program which would require an increase in
                            the debt limit; then he went on to cite Navajo as a perfect example of
                            wasted effort, as was Falcon which has been under revision for three
                            years, he said, with nothing but a little change in the paint job. Then
                            he referred to an anti-tank missile which would probably never be
                            needed. He thought perhaps a committee ought to survey the whole
                            business and drastically eliminate duplicating items.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McElroy said he was in general agreement with the basic purpose of
                            the Senator’s argument though he could not agree on each of the
                            specifics. Sen. <persName>Anderson</persName> thought that the cost of
                            changing from Corporal to Sergeant went way beyond anything that could
                            be tolerated in a business undertaking. The President turned to
                                “<persName corresp="#p_ACP1">Clinton</persName>” and said that he
                            had had at least 30 full dress briefings on all of this and that the
                            whole trouble lay in finding what made something truly effective
                            tactically. He said that the development effort was going ahead on a
                            dozen different tangents, something on which he had spoken with some
                            bitterness, frankly, to Mr. Guy Holaday. The experts had argued however,
                            that another $40 or $45 million might be just the difference needed to
                            make Redstone a magnificent weapon. But, the President agreed, the
                            matter of spending $5.2 billion without putting a single weapon in the
                            arsenals seemed terrible—yet the experts were of a different view and
                            the question of what to take out was virtually insoluble; so the
                            Administration policy had been to concentrate <pb xml:id="pg_702" n="702" facs="0726"/>on those that looked the most likely and to go
                            slow with those that seemed least likely to succeed. He invited Sen.
                                <persName>Anderson</persName> to go over to the Defense Department
                            where they would brief him for two solid days—and leave him thoroughly
                            confused!</p>
                        <p>Mr. McElroy again noted the evolutionary stage of missile development,
                            something that would not go on indefinitely. He mentioned that the
                            Sergeant is a solid propellant missile, thus completely different from
                            the Corporal. He said that Defense had cut out some of the missiles
                            under study and more would be cut as time goes on.</p>
                        <p>Rep. McCormack<note n="7" xml:id="d169fn7">Representative John W.
                                McCormack (D–Mass.).</note> noted the President’s appointment of Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName>, a man who commanded
                            great admiration among Democrats as well as Republicans. Mr. McCormack
                            hoped that the President would give him great support. The President
                            responded that he would not otherwise have appointed Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName>! He went on to say that
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> should be able to do
                            a lot in straightening out these puzzles. Even though operating
                            responsibility was delegated from the President to the Secretary of
                            Defense and <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> had none of
                            it, nevertheless he would be in a position to be very helpful to
                            both.</p>

                        <p>Mr. McElroy said he would like to have the President’s concurrence in the
                            over-all figure for the Defense budget, and in the split between <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 58 and 59. After discussion with
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>, he felt that
                            he should go in for an additional $1260 million <gloss target="#t_NOA1">NOA</gloss> in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 58 (he had tried
                            to put as large an amount as seemed solid and well justified into a
                            request for the current year.) This would cover acceleration <pb xml:id="pg_703" n="703" facs="0727"/>and augmentation relating to
                            Polaris, to <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> dispersal, to ballistic
                            missile detection, to procurement of the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>, and to procurement of Thor and Jupiter.</p>
                        <p>The President said he thought he gathered from Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> that the latter felt a
                            decision should be made as between Thor and Jupiter. Mr. McElroy said
                            that after the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and other
                            conferences we should have an indication of the speed at which the
                                <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>’s are desired, and could then
                            make a decision. He added that we need to have a number of successful
                            flights of complete missiles before we make the decision. He also said
                            that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> think there would be value
                            in putting the <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> in Turkey, Okinawa,
                            and Alaska.</p>
                        <p>For <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 59, Mr. McElroy said he would like
                            a gross total of $39.153 billion in <gloss target="#t_NOA1">NOA</gloss>—taking account of a reduction through stock fund
                            liquidation, the net <gloss target="#t_NOA1">NOA</gloss> figure would be
                            $38.828. Thus the over-all <gloss target="#t_NOA1">NOA</gloss> pattern
                            would be $36.6 billion in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 58 and $38.8
                            billion in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 59—thus showing a step-up
                            of about $2 billion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McElroy said he had dropped out of his budget $300 million for the
                            “6%” increase for military and civilian pay. This was based on
                            yesterday’s decision reported to him to limit proposals to the Cordiner
                            proposals, and hold back with regard to other pay until pressures
                            required some Administration action. The President asked whether the
                            $430 million figure remaining included a 6% increase for some military
                            people (those not benefiting from the Cordiner proposals). Mr. McElroy
                            said it did not—that would add $150 million. The President said he did
                            not feel we should raise the pay of people in their first enlistment,
                            and Mr. McElroy said the $150 million would not include any increase for
                            a man fulfilling his period of obligated service.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McElroy said that, second, he needed to tell the services what force
                            levels for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 60 and <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 61 they should use for their planning. He
                            wanted to say that they should continue to use the 2,525,000 figure,
                            with a further proviso that this figure would probably not change more
                            than 5%. The President indicated general assent to this proposal.</p>
                        <p>The President said he still sticks a little on the proposed $140 million
                            add-on for research. He recalled that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KJRJ1">Killian</persName> said he could justify these figures, but his
                            interest is really to know whether they are necessary. After further
                            discussion on this point, Mr. McElroy said he would keep an eye on this
                            matter, but no change or reconsideration was definitely agreed upon.</p>
                        <p>The President said what he is really giving a lot of thought to is what
                            is the figure that will create confidence. He thought that a feeling of
                            greater confidence in the security sphere might go over into economic
                            confidence as well, and thus help the economic picture. The President
                            said that he thought that about two-thirds of the supplementary funds
                            are more to stabilize public opinion than to meet the real need for
                            acceleration, and Mr. McElroy agreed. Mr. McElroy said that <pb xml:id="pg_704" n="704" facs="0728"/>expenditures for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 58 are now set for $38.61 billion, and
                            for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 59 at $39.441 billion, and added
                            that there is no panic in that kind of a program.</p>

                            comments on the development loan fund, the Vice President inquired
                            whether we had not previously argued, in defense of this development
                            loan fund, that it involved an increased trend toward loans for foreign

                        <p>The Vice President continued by pointing out that we must make this point
                            clear to the Congress because the totals for our military and economic
                            assistance remained about the same, and this would require explanation
                            to the Congress.</p>

                            predicted that loans would probably be down in the next fiscal year, and

                            wished to make a statement at this point. Mr. Smith explained that he
                            wished to speak to the economic rather than the military side of the
                            mutual security program. He pointed out <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s challenge to the United States some three
                            Weeks ago, and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s
                            statement that the Soviet Union would soon surpass the United States in
                            competition in the field of peaceful production.<note n="5" xml:id="d171fn5">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> addressed the
                                Supreme Soviet on November 6.</note> There was clear evidence,
                            continued Mr. Smith, that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has put this program to work. After citing
                            various instances of Soviet assistance and activities in the
                            underdeveloped countries, Mr. Smith also pointed out the role of
                            Communist China and the Satellites. He also listed briefly what
                            assistance was being given by the Soviet Union to non-Satellite nations
                            in terms of credits or other forms of assistance. He believed that this
                            economic competition from the Soviet Bloc posed a very serious challenge
                            to the United States and the Free World. He accordingly said he strongly
                            supported the figures just presented by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> for this Mutual Security Program for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>s 1957, 1958 and 1959. Beyond this, Mr.
                            Smith recommended that the United States call for the establishment of a
                            long-term international economic corps for peace, whose function would
                            be to assist the less-developed nations. The National Security Council
                            must respond to the challenge offered by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.</p>
                        <p>When Mr. Smith had finished his statement, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> reverted to the question he had posed at the end
                            of his presentation—namely, the desirability of asking the Department of
                            Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to undertake a study with respect
                            to our military assistance programs in the period 1960–65. He first
                            asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> to
                            comment on the desirability of such a study.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_706" n="706" facs="0730"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> replied that the
                            United States must certainly look ahead, but that there were very great
                            uncertainties in so doing. For example, we do not know what the Soviets
                            will be doing in the period 1960–65, although whatever they did would
                            obviously affect what we do. Another factor was the progressive
                            improvement in the economies of our allies and, accordingly, of the
                            portion of the burden which these allies could take over from the United
                            States. Perhaps the best way to approach such a study as that proposed
                            by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> would be to do it in
                            terms of a probable range. In any event, the Department of Defense would
                            do its best in what would certainly be a very complicated task.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out that of
                            course he did not expect complete accuracy in a study covering future
                            years, but was seeking only general orders of magnitude. He then asked
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName>, as Acting
                            Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for his views on the feasibility
                            of the proposed study.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> pointed out that it
                            would be very hard for the Joint Chiefs of Staff to produce anything
                            very meaningful. The assumptions chosen for such a study would almost
                            certainly provide the answer to the problem. In order to make a
                            meaningful study we would have to know more than we possibly could know
                            about a great many factors.</p>
                        <p>In view of Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName>’s
                            comments, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> wondered
                            whether, instead of calling for the study he proposed, the Council could
                            ask the Department of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to tell the
                            Council what might be accomplished in the way of a useful study.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President expressed doubts that anything useful could be
                            anticipated from the study proposed, and went on to state that it had
                            occurred to him, in looking at the charts and the data which Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> had used, that the
                            matter of greatest concern to the United States in the future was where
                            emphasis should be placed as between military and economic assistance.
                            In the first place, said the Vice President, it seemed clear to him that
                            the Soviet Union was now placing much more emphasis on economic programs
                            than it had previously done. From our own standpoint, we must not allow
                            ourselves to be so obsessed with the patterns of the past that we were
                            incapable of changing the pattern and changing the emphasis. The Vice
                            President believed that we must give much more thought and attention to
                            economic assistance and, wherever possible, less to military assistance.
                            He added that of course in certain countries, like Korea and other areas
                            where the Chiefs of Staff felt that military aid was needed at a high
                            level, we could not change this emphasis. On the other hand, there
                            seemed to be areas where we could increase our economic assistance, and
                            in general economic assistance was less costly than military
                            assistance.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_707" n="707" facs="0731"/>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> commented that the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff would agree with the point made by the Vice
                            President. The latter went on to observe that if we were not very
                            careful in our analysis of the facts and figures which had been
                            presented today, there was danger that we would continue in our old ruts
                            and be unwilling to try out any new paths. The economic side, he said,
                            was the wave of the future.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> confirmed the
                            view that the Soviets were shifting emphasis to economic from military
                            assistance. He added that in many underdeveloped countries—such as Egypt
                            and Syria—the receipt of armament had reached, so to speak, the
                            saturation point. Such countries had already received larger armaments
                            than they could effectively support or use.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> commented that,
                            along the lines suggested by the Vice President, and as one analyzed our
                            military assistance programs, one finds that a large part of the
                            pressure for military assistance from foreign countries derived from
                            local tensions and local conditions rather than as a response to our
                            great problem of containing Communism. To Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> this meant that the United
                            States should make a greater effort to quiet down local tensions. If we
                            succeeded in doing this we would be able to cut down on our military
                            assistance programs and increase the amounts available for economic
                            assistance.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President commented that another factor which had always tended
                            to emphasize our military assistance programs over our economic
                            assistance programs, was the comparative ease of selling our policy of
                            military assistance to the American people and the Congress, and the
                            difficulty of selling our program of economic aid.</p>
                        <p>At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> suggested
                            that the Council request the Department of Defense and the Joint Chiefs
                            of Staff to see what they could suggest in the way of a study and report
                            to the Council before they actually undertake any study.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> pointed out that
                            in the UN today the United States was going to propose a greatly
                            expanded technical assistance fund for economic development.</p>
                        <p>(The President returned to the meeting at this time, 10:30 a.m.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. George Allen, Director of the U.S. Information Agency, said he felt
                            that many people in the world believe that all our answers to world
                            problems are military answers. This was a mistaken view which we must
                            nevertheless correct. At present we give too many opportunities to
                            Soviet propaganda describing us as warmongers. To illustrate his point,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen</persName> read excerpts from a
                            speech which was being made today by the Secretary of Labor. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen</persName> pointed out that he was
                            far from insisting that the public relations factor was the governing
                            factor; but it was certainly an important factor.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_708" n="708" facs="0732"/>
                        <p>The President commented that in terms of our setting forth our military
                            capabilities before the world, we were damned if we did and damned if we
                            didn’t. He was not sure that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen</persName>’s point was correct. The problem was how to inform
                            our own people in a logical way of our military capabilities, without at
                            the same time scaring our allies to death.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen</persName> replied that there was
                            even an unfortunate impression going around abroad that the President
                            was going to the forthcoming <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            meeting in order to beg our allies to permit us to station atomic
                            weapons on their soil. The President answered that this, of course, was
                            completely erroneous. We were only trying to assure our allies of our
                            support if they were attacked.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President, addressing the President, said that the President
                            could give assurance on the score of our strength in very short order at
                            the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting. But it also seemed to
                            the Vice President that the great appeal that the President exerts in
                            the world today is that he was considered to be a man of peace.
                            Accordingly, the Vice President thought that the President’s greatest
                            contribution would consist in a re-affirmation of the peaceful
                            objectives and purposes of the United States. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen</persName> said that he could not agree
                            more.</p>

                            of the enclosures to the reference memoranda of November 29 and December

                            to the President for National Security Affairs. Taking into account the
                            tremendous changes in weapons technology and the resulting problem of
                            modernization and provision of advanced weapons, the suggested study
                            would (on the assumption of a continuation of present basic policy)
                            review the missions, force levels and equipment programs for the nations
                            receiving U.S. military assistance in the period 1960–65, and estimate
                            the general order of magnitude of the probable costs thereof.</p>
                        <p>c. Noted an oral statement by the Director/International Cooperation

                        <p>In December 1957 Frank C. Nash, former Assistant Secretary of Defense for
                            International Security Affairs, completed a study entitled “United
                            States Overseas Military Bases: Report to the President.” This 93-page
                            report was undertaken in response to President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s letter to Nash, dated
                            October 15, 1956, asking him “to carry out a study of and make
                            recommendations with respect to our system of overseas military bases
                            and operating facilities.” <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s letter further stated that the
                            “preservation of our overseas military bases and facilities is a vital
                            element in deterring aggression and in the security of our country and
                            that of our allies and friends,” and he hoped that Nash’s study would be
                            “a wide-ranging examination of all elements of the problem of how to
                            obtain and preserve essential overseas military facilities.” The
                            President urged Nash “to explore anything which is relevant to this
                            general problem” and made several suggestions, including “a case-by-case
                            analysis of each of the local situations where we have military bases,
                            operating rights, and facilities.”</p>

                            attached as Annex A to Nash’s report. Annex B, entitled “Negotiations

                        <p>Nash’s report contained a discussion of his research strategy, including
                            questionnaires addressed to United States diplomatic and military
                            personnel, interviews with high-ranking officials of the Departments of
                            State and Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and four field trips
                            covering the Caribbean (April 1957), Far East (May), Europe and North
                            Africa (June–July), and Canada (July), the historical pattern of <pb xml:id="pg_710" n="710" facs="0734"/>United States base development

                            recommendations calling for maximum coordination between United States
                            military and diplomatic representatives abroad as well as between all

                            United States Information Agency, and the intelligence community.</p>
                        <p>A separate Appendix of 191 pages, entitled “Country Studies,” dated
                            November 1957, provided a breakdown of United States facilities in 29
                            foreign nations. Each of these country studies contained statistical
                            data on major U.S. facilities and installations, total acreage used by
                            U.S. forces, number of U.S. military and civilian personnel (including
                            dependents), and foreign employees of U.S. forces as well as a short
                            discussion of the mission of U.S. forces, governing agreements, local
                            forces, general orientation, problems, and recommendations.</p>

                            work. His staff assembled the Report, and on December 24, his principal

                            the President referred it to the National Security Council for

                        <p>1. I have carefully reviewed the Gaither report from the point of view of
                            consistency between the statements with respect to Soviet capabilities
                            contained therein and the statements which my associates and I made on
                            the same subject before the Senate Preparedness Subcommittee on 26 and
                            27 November 1957.<note n="2" xml:id="d173fn2">

                                testimony on these days has not been published. The Gaither report

                            statement with respect to Soviet capabilities that was not contained in
                            my presentation to the Subcommittee.</p>

                        <p>3. The Gaither report differs from my presentation in that it contains
                            numerous net estimates of U.S. military strengths relative to those of
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and, in an annex, a Time Table

                            myself to Soviet gross capabilities in various military fields with

                                    J said he said he would work out a plan to get the needed facts.
                                    The Sec said it is new to him. J told of his position which held
                                    temporarily but he does not think it will. J thinks the Sec

                            </note> The President said he was in favor of a sanitized version. He
                            said, however, that this experience had proved, he thought definitively,
                            the unwisdom of calling in outside groups. I pointed out that one of the
                            troubles was that they seldom took a rounded view of the total
                            situation. There were many things which were themselves good to do but
                            where the benefit of seeking the wherewithal to do them involved
                            conflicts with other things perhaps of more importance. We had to avoid
                            inflation which might have serious consequences throughout the free
                            world. We had to get money for economic warfare, and so forth. I did not
                            feel the Gaither Committee had adequately explored such problems. The
                            President said he was opposed to the spending of billions for shelters.
                            He felt it would have an adverse effect in many respects. I said that
                            these matters were, I assumed, largely a matter of temperament, and that
                            I was temperamentally unsympathetic to such defensive measures. I felt
                            that they colored one’s outlook in many other respects. I felt that a
                            strong offensive capability as a deterrent was more effective in many
                            ways.</p>
